item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations note regarding amounts and fiscal year references in this annual report, all amounts related to united states dollars and foreign currency and to the number of nordson corporation's common shares, except for per share earnings and dividend amounts, are expressed in thousands. unless the context otherwise indicates, all references to "we," "us," "our," or the "company" mean nordson corporation.
unless otherwise noted, all references to years relate to our fiscal year ending october 31.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that are used to prepare financial statements. we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management.
certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. on a regular basis, critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors.
revenue recognition - most of our revenues are recognized upon shipment, provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable, collectibility is reasonably assured, and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. the fasb has issued guidance on multiple deliverable arrangements that establishes a relative selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence (vsoe) if available, third-party evidence (tpe) if vendor-specific objective evidence is not available, or best estimated selling price (besp) if neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence is available. our multiple deliverable arrangements include installation, installation supervision, training, and spare parts, which tend to be completed in a short period of time, at an insignificant cost, and utilizing skills not unique to us, and, therefore, are typically regarded as inconsequential or perfunctory. revenue for undelivered items is deferred and included within accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet. revenues deferred in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were not material.
translation of foreign currency financial statements and foreign currency transactions - our reporting currency is the u.s. dollar. however, the functional currency for each of our foreign subsidiaries is its principal operating currency. we translate the amounts included in our consolidated statements of income from our foreign subsidiaries into u.s. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates, which we believe are representative of the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. our foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into u.s. dollars from local currency at the actual exchange rates as of the end of each reporting date, and we record the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). if the u.s. dollar strengthens, we reflect the resulting losses as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). conversely, if the u.s. dollar weakens, foreign exchange translation gains result, which favorably impact accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). translation adjustments may be included in net earnings in the event of a sale or liquidation of certain of our underlying foreign investments. if we determine that the functional currency of any of our foreign subsidiaries should be the u.s. dollar, our financial statements will be affected. should this occur, we will adjust our reporting to appropriately account for any such changes.
as appropriate, we use permanently invested intercompany loans as a source of capital to reduce exposure to foreign currency fluctuations at our foreign subsidiaries. these loans, on a consolidated basis, are treated as being analogous to equity for accounting purposes. therefore, foreign exchange gains or losses on these intercompany loans are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
goodwill - goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in various business combinations. goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level, or more often if indications of impairment exist. our reporting units are the adhesive dispensing systems segment, the industrial coating systems segment and one level below the advanced technology systems segment.
nordson corporation 22
we test goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification (asc) 350. the goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. in the first step, performed in the fourth quarter of each year, we estimate a reporting unit's fair value using a combination of the discounted cash flow method of the income approach and the guideline public company method of the market approach and compare the result against the reporting unit's carrying value of net assets. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then a second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired. we use an independent valuation specialist to assist with refining our assumptions and methods used to determine fair values using these methods. in step one, the discounted cash flow method uses assumptions for revenue growth, operating margin, and working capital turnover that are based on general management's strategic plans tempered by performance trends and reasonable expectations about those trends. terminal value calculations employ a published formula known as the gordon growth model method that essentially captures the present value of perpetual cash flows beyond the last projected period assuming a constant weighted average cost of capital (wacc) methodology and growth rate. for each reporting unit, a sensitivity analysis is performed to vary the discount and terminal growth rates in order to provide a range of reasonableness for detecting impairment.
discount rates are developed using a wacc methodology. the wacc represents the blended average required rate of return for equity and debt capital based on observed market return data and company specific risk factors. for 2015, the discount rates used ranged from 10 percent to 16 percent depending upon the reporting unit's size, end market volatility, and projection risk. the calculated internal rate of return for the discounted cash flow method was 11 percent, the same as the calculated wacc for total nordson. in the application of the guideline public company method, fair value is determined using transactional evidence for similar publicly traded equity. the comparable company guideline group is determined based on relative similarities to each reporting unit since exact correlations are not available. an indication of fair value for each reporting unit is based on the placement of each reporting unit within a range of multiples determined for its comparable guideline company group. valuation multiples are derived by dividing latest twelve month performance for revenues and ebitda into total invested capital, which is the sum of traded equity plus interest bearing debt less cash. these multiples are applied against the revenue and ebitda of each reporting unit. while the implied indications of fair value using the guideline public company method yield meaningful results, the discounted cash flow method of the income approach includes management's thoughtful projections and insights as to what the reporting units will accomplish in the near future. accordingly, the reasonable, implied fair value of each reporting unit is a blend based on the relative strength of the approaches employed.
to test the reasonableness of the aggregate fair value, we performed the control premium test, which compares the sum of the implied fair values calculated for our reporting units (net of debt) to the market value of equity. the control premium was 3 percent as of the test date of august 1, 2015 and 13 percent as of october 31, 2015. the control premium indicated that the discounted cash flow valuation was reasonable.
in 2015 and 2014, the results of our step one testing indicated no impairment; therefore, the second step of impairment testing was not necessary.
nordson corporation 23
the excess of fair value (fv) over carrying value (cv) was compared to the carrying value for each reporting unit. based on the results shown in the table below and based on our measurement date of august 1, 2015, our conclusion is that no indicators of impairment exist in 2015. potential events or circumstances, such as a sustained downturn in global economies, could have a negative effect on estimated fair values.
wacc       excess of       goodwill fv over cv

adhesive dispensing systems segment                                10%            349%      $382,301
industrial coating systems segment                                 16%            190%       $24,058
advanced technology systems segment - electronics                  12%            377%       $17,454
systems advanced technology systems segment - fluid                        12%             92%      $608,876
management advanced technology systems segment - test &amp; inspection        16%             64%       $14,397
the table above does not include two acquisitions that occurred after the august 1 measurement date but before our fiscal year-end. we acquired wafo produktionsgesellschaft gmbh ("wafo") on august 3, 2015 and matrix technologies gmbh ("matrix") on september 1, 2015. determination of the preliminary goodwill associated with these acquisitions was completed with the assistance of an independent valuation specialist in the fourth quarter of 2015. since the dates of the valuations, no events or changes in circumstances have occurred that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of these acquisitions below their carrying values. for future valuation purposes, wafo will be included in the adhesive dispensing systems segment reporting unit, and matrix will be included in the advanced technology systems - test & inspection reporting unit.
other long-lived assets - we test other depreciable and amortizable long-lived assets for recoverability in accordance with asc 360 using undiscounted cash flows if indicators of impairment exist. the total carrying value of long-lived assets for each reporting unit is compared to the forecasted cash flows of each reporting unit's long-lived assets being tested. cash flows have been defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, less annual maintenance capital spending.
inventories - inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. cost was determined using the last-in, first-out (lifo) method for 20 percent of consolidated inventories at october 31, 2015 and october 31, 2014, with the first-in, first-out (fifo) method used for the remaining inventory. on an ongoing basis, inventory is tested for technical obsolescence, as well as for future demand and changes in market conditions. we have historically maintained inventory reserves to reflect those conditions when the cost of inventory is not expected to be recovered. reserves are also maintained for inventory used for demonstration purposes. the inventory reserve balance was $28,230, $26,744 and $26,579 at october 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
pension plans and postretirement medical plans - the measurement of liabilities related to our pension plans and postretirement medical plans is based on management's assumptions related to future factors, including interest rates, return on pension plan assets, compensation increases, mortality and turnover assumptions, and health care cost trend rates.
the weighted-average discount rate used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 4.39 percent at october 31, 2015 and 4.29 percent at october 31, 2014. the weighted-average discount rate used to determine the present value of our various international pension plan obligations was 2.81 percent at october 31, 2015, compared to 2.94 percent at october 31, 2014. the discount rates used for all plans were determined by using quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled.
in determining the expected return on plan assets, we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future long-term rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans. we consult with and consider the opinions of financial and actuarial experts in developing appropriate return assumptions. the expected rate of return (long-term investment rate) on domestic pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 6.76 percent in 2015 and 7.24 percent in 2014. the average expected rate of return on international pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 4.39 percent in 2015 and 4.60 percent in 2014.
nordson corporation 24
the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 3.50 percent at october 31, 2015, compared to 3.49 percent at october 31, 2014. the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our international pension plan obligations was 3.22 percent at october 31, 2015, compared to 3.19 percent at october 31, 2014.
annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year. differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years.
with respect to the domestic postretirement medical plan, the discount rate used to value the benefit plan was 4.50 percent at october 31, 2015 and 4.40 percent at october 31, 2014. the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits (the health care cost trend rate) is assumed to be 3.72 percent in 2016, decreasing gradually to 3.27 percent in 2025.
for the international postretirement plan, the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation was 4.35 percent at october 31, 2015 and 4.25 percent at october 31, 2014. the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits (the health care cost trend rate) is assumed to be 6.31 percent in 2016, decreasing gradually to 3.50 percent in 2031.
employees hired after january 1, 2002, are not eligible to participate in the domestic postretirement medical plan.
pension and postretirement expenses in 2016 are expected to be approximately $4,900 lower than 2015, primarily due to changes in discount rates.
income taxes - income taxes are estimated based on income for financial reporting purposes. deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and certain changes in valuation allowances. we provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
management believes the valuation allowances are adequate after considering future taxable income, allowable carryforward periods and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount (including the valuation allowance), an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made. conversely, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be expensed in the period such determination was made.
further, at each interim reporting period, we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full year. significant judgment is involved regarding the application of global income tax laws and regulations and when projecting the jurisdictional mix of income. additionally, interpretation of tax laws, court decisions or other guidance provided by taxing authorities influences our estimate of the effective income tax rates. as a result, our actual effective income tax rates and related income tax liabilities may differ materially from our estimated effective tax rates and related income tax liabilities. any resulting differences are recorded in the period they become known.
financial instruments - assets, liabilities and commitments that are to be settled in cash and are denominated in foreign currencies are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, which are derivative financial instruments, to reduce the risk of foreign currency exposures resulting from the collection of receivables, payables and loans denominated in foreign currencies. the maturities of these contracts are usually less than 90 days. forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and therefore are marked to market each accounting period, and the resulting gains or losses are included in "other-net" within other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of income.
warranties - we provide customers with a product warranty that requires us to repair or replace defective products within a specified period of time (generally one year) from the date of delivery or first use. an accrual is recorded for expected warranty costs for products shipped through the end of each accounting period. in determining the amount of the accrual, we rely primarily on historical warranty claims. amounts charged to the warranty reserve were $12,531, $10,813 and $7,891 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the reserve balance was $10,537, $9,918 and $9,409 at october 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
nordson corporation 25
performance share incentive awards - executive officers and selected other key employees are eligible to receive share awards with payouts based on corporate financial performance over three-year periods. award payouts vary based on the degree to which corporate financial performance equals or exceeds predetermined threshold, target and maximum performance levels at the end of a performance period. no award payout will occur unless certain threshold performance levels are equaled or exceeded. the amount of compensation expense is based upon current performance projections for each three-year performance period and the percentage of the requisite service that has been rendered. the calculations are also based upon the grant date fair value determined using the closing market price of nordson common stock at the grant date, reduced by the implied value of dividends not to be paid. awards are recorded as capital in excess of stated value in shareholders' equity. the cumulative amount recorded at october 31, 2015 for the plans originating in 2013, 2014 and 2015 was $7,561. compensation expense attributable to all performance share incentive award periods for executive officers and selected other key employees for 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $3,459, $4,304 and $3,588, respectively.
2015 compared to 2014
sales - worldwide sales for 2015 were $1,688,666, a decrease of 0.9 percent from 2014 sales of $1,704,021. sales volume increased 5.8 percent, and unfavorable currency translation effects caused by the stronger u.s. dollar reduced sales by 6.7 percent. the volume increase consisted of 3.4 percent from organic growth and 2.4 percent from acquisitions. three acquisitions were made during 2015: liquidyn gmbh and matrix, which are included within the advanced technology systems segment, and wafo, which is included in the adhesives dispensing systems segment. two acquisitions were made during 2014: avalon laboratories and dima group b.v., both of which were included within the advanced technology systems segment. as used throughout this form 10-k, geographic regions include the americas (canada, mexico and central and south america), asia pacific (excluding japan), europe, japan, and the united states.
sales of the adhesive dispensing systems segment were $836,066 in 2015, a decrease of $63,630, or 7.1 percent, from 2014 sales of $899,696. the decrease was the net result of a sales volume increase of 2.3 percent offset by unfavorable currency effects that reduced sales by 9.4 percent. the sales volume increase consisted of 0.3 percent from acquisitions and 2.0 percent from organic volume. within this segment, sales volume, inclusive of acquisitions, increased in all geographic regions except for the united states, and was particularly strong in the americas. organic growth in product lines serving disposable hygiene, general product assembly, rigid packaging and injection molding end markets was offset by softness in product lines serving extrusion, polymer compounding and pelletizing end markets.
sales of the advanced technology systems segment were $593,858 in 2015, an increase of $32,074, or 5.7 percent, from 2014 sales of $561,784. the increase was the result of a sales volume increase of 8.6 percent offset by unfavorable currency effects that reduced sales by 2.9 percent. the sales volume increase consisted of 1.7 percent from organic volume and 6.9 percent from the first-year effect of acquisitions. within the segment, sales volume, inclusive of acquisitions, increased in all geographic regions, except for japan, and was most pronounced in the united states, europe and the americas. growth in surface treatment, test and inspection and plasma solutions in electronics end markets, as well as growth in fluid management applications serving medical end markets, was offset by lower demand for automated dispensing systems.
sales of the industrial coating systems segment were $258,742 in 2015, an increase of $16,201, or 6.7 percent, from 2014 sales of $242,541. the increase was the result of a sales volume increase of 12.5 percent offset by unfavorable currency effects that reduced sales by 5.8 percent. the sales volume increase was entirely due to organic growth. within this segment, sales volume increased in all geographic regions, and was most pronounced in the americas and europe. sales growth was driven by demand in our consumer durable, automotive, cold materials, industrial and container end markets.
nordson corporation 26
sales outside the united states accounted for 68.6 percent of our sales in 2015, as compared to 70.4 percent in 2014. on a geographic basis, sales in the united states were $529,893, an increase of 5.2 percent from 2014. the increase consisted of 0.6 percent organic volume and 4.6 percent from acquisitions. in the americas region, sales were $129,325, an increase of 6.9 percent from 2014, with volume increasing 18.8 percent offset by unfavorable currency effects of 11.9 percent. the increase in sales volume consisted of 18.6 percent from organic volume and 0.2 percent from acquisitions. sales in europe were $462,565, down 6.5 percent from 2014, with volume increasing 8.1 percent offset by unfavorable currency effects of 14.6 percent. the increase in sales volume consisted of 5.5 percent from organic growth and 2.6 percent from acquisitions. sales in japan were $107,797, down 15.2 percent from the prior year. the decrease was due to lower volume of 1.3 percent and unfavorable currency effects of 13.9 percent. the decrease in sales volume consisted of an organic volume decline of 1.4 percent offset by a 0.1 percent increase from acquisitions. sales in the asia pacific region were $459,086, an increase of 0.3 percent from the prior year, with volume increasing 2.6 percent, offset by unfavorable currency effects of 2.3 percent. the increase in sales volume consisted of 1.4 percent from organic growth and 1.2 percent from acquisitions.
it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenue was not material relative to 2014.
operating profit - cost of sales were $774,702 in 2015, up 2.1 percent from 2014. gross profit, expressed as a percentage of sales, decreased to 54.1 percent in 2015 from 55.5 percent in 2014. the reduction in gross margin was primarily a result of product line and customer mix and the unfavorable effects of currency translation.
selling and administrative expenses, were $584,823 in 2015, an increase of $9,381, or 1.6 percent, from 2014. the increase was primarily due to the addition of acquired businesses in the second half of 2014 and 2015 and higher compensation expenses related to increased employment levels.
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 34.6 percent in 2015 from 33.8 percent in 2014, due primarily to acquisitions and higher compensation expenses related to increased employment levels, partially offset by currency effects that reduced expenses.
severance and restructuring costs of $11,411 were recorded in 2015.  within the adhesives dispensing systems segment, restructuring initiatives to optimize operations in the u.s. and belgium resulted in severance and restructuring costs of $7,972. within the advanced technology systems segment, certain restructuring programs to enhance operational efficiency and customer service in the u.s. and germany resulted in severance and restructuring costs of $3,060. within the industrial coatings systems segment, a restructuring program to enhance operational efficiency and customer service resulted in severance costs of $379.
operating profit as a percentage of sales was 18.8 percent in 2015 compared to 21.5 percent in 2014. the decrease was primarily due to product line and customer mix and the unfavorable effects of currency translation.
operating capacity for each of our segments can support fluctuations in order activity without significant changes in operating costs. also, currency translation affects reported operating margins. operating margins for each segment were unfavorably impacted by a much stronger dollar during 2015 as compared to 2014.
operating profit as a percentage of sales for the adhesive dispensing systems segment decreased to 23.4 percent in 2015 from 25.5 percent in 2014. the decline in 2015 was due primarily to severance and restructuring costs and unfavorable effects of currency translation.
operating profit as a percentage of sales for the advanced technology systems segment decreased to 20.4 percent in 2015 from 25.0 percent in 2014. the decrease was due primarily to product line and customer mix and severance and restructuring costs.
operating profit as a percentage of sales for the industrial coating systems segment increased to 16.0 percent in 2015 from 15.7 percent in 2014. the increase was due primarily to the leverage of higher sales volume, partially offset by severance and restructuring costs and the unfavorable effects of currency translation.
interest and other income (expense) - interest expense in 2015 was $18,104, an increase of $3,069, or 20.4 percent, from 2014. the increase was due to higher borrowing levels used primarily to fund acquisitions in the second half of 2014 and in 2015, and to fund the purchase of treasury shares in 2015.
nordson corporation 27
other income in 2015 was $678 compared to other expense of $138 in 2014. significant items included in 2015 were proceeds from a favorable litigation settlement of $1,608 and loss on disposal of fixed assets of $653.  significant items included in 2014 were a gain on property insurance settlement of $1,005 and foreign currency losses of $478.
income taxes - income tax expense in 2015 was $89,751, or 29.8 percent of pre-tax income, as compared to $105,740, or 30.0 percent of pre-tax income in 2014.
on december 19, 2014, the tax increase prevention act of 2014 was enacted which retroactively reinstated the federal research and development tax credit (federal r&d tax credit) from january 1, 2014 to december 31, 2014 and extended certain other tax provisions. as a result, our income tax provision for 2015 included discrete tax benefits of $2,486 primarily related to 2014.
net income - net income was $211,111, or $3.45 per diluted share, in 2015, compared to net income of $246,773, or $3.84 per diluted share, in 2014. this represents a 14.5 percent decrease in net income and a 10.2 percent decrease in diluted earnings per share.
recently issued accounting standards - in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued a new standard regarding revenue recognition.  under this standard, a company recognizes revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. the standard implements a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control.  in august 2015, the fasb issued a standard to delay the effective date by one year. in accordance with this delay, the new standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2019. early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date of the standard. the new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application. we are currently assessing the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements as well as the method by which we will adopt the new standard.
in april 2015, the fasb issued a new standard regarding the presentation of debt issuance costs.  under this standard, a company is required to present unamortized debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, rather than as a separate asset. the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by this new standard.  in august 2015, the fasb issued an amendment to this standard to address line-of-credit arrangements, which would allow an entity to present debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortize the debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement. it will be effective for us beginning in 2017. we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as it will only impact presentation.
in july 2015, the fasb issued a new standard regarding the measurement of inventory. under this standard, inventory that is measured using the first-in, first-out ("fifo") or average cost methods is required to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. this standard does not impact inventory measured on a last-in, last-out ("lifo") method. it will be effective for us beginning in 2017. we are currently assessing the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.
in september 2015, the fasb issued a new standard intended to simplify the accounting for measurement period adjustments in a business combination. measurement period adjustments are changes to provisional amounts recorded when the accounting for a business combination is incomplete as of the end of a reporting period. the measurement period can extend for up to a year following the transaction date. during the measurement period, companies may make adjustments to provisional amounts when information necessary to complete the measurement is received. the new guidance requires companies to recognize these adjustments, including any related impacts to net income, in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined. companies are no longer required to retroactively apply measurement period adjustments to all periods presented. it will be effective for us beginning in 2017. the new guidance will be applied prospectively and the impact of adoption will be dependent on the nature of measurement period adjustments that may be necessary.

2014 compared to 2013
sales - worldwide sales for 2014 were $1,704,021, an increase of 10.4 percent from 2013 sales of $1,542,921. sales volume increased 10.9 percent, and unfavorable currency effects caused by the stronger u.s. dollar primarily against the japanese yen reduced sales by 0.5 percent. the volume increase consisted of 6.2 percent from organic growth and 4.7 percent from acquisitions. two acquisitions were made during 2014: avalon laboratories and dima group b.v., both of which are included within the advanced technology systems segment. three acquisitions were made during 2013: the kreyenborg group and certain assets of kodama chemical industry co., ltd., both of which were included within the adhesives dispensing systems segment and certain assets of nellcor puritan bennett mexico, s.a. de c.v., a subsidiary of covidien lp ("nellcor"), which was included within the advanced technology systems segment.
as used throughout this form 10-k, geographic regions include the americas (canada, mexico and central and south america), asia pacific (excluding japan), europe, japan, and the united states.
sales of the adhesive dispensing systems segment were $899,696 in 2014, an increase of $106,208, or 13.4 percent, from 2013 sales of $793,488. the increase was the result of a sales volume increase of 14.3 percent offset by unfavorable currency effects that reduced sales by 0.9 percent. the sales volume increase consisted of 8.1 percent from acquisitions and 6.2 percent from organic volume. sales volume, inclusive of acquisitions, increased in all geographic regions and was particularly strong in the europe and asia pacific regions. organic growth in all product lines was driven by our disposable hygiene, rigid packaging, polymer processing and general product assembly end markets.
sales of the advanced technology systems segment were $561,784 in 2014, an increase of $45,518, or 8.8 percent, from 2013 sales of $516,266. the increase was the result of a sales volume increase of 8.4 percent and favorable currency effects that increased sales by 0.4 percent. the sales volume increase consisted of 6.8% from organic volume and 1.6% from the first-year effect of acquisitions. within the segment, sales volume, inclusive of acquisitions, increased in all geographic regions, except the americas, and were most pronounced in japan and asia pacific. strong organic growth in all product lines was led by demand for our automated dispensing equipment related to electronic mobile device assembly end markets, along with higher demand for our electronic test and inspection equipment, semi-automated dispensing systems and single-use fluid management components related to medical and industrial end markets.
sales of the industrial coating systems segment were $242,541 in 2014, an increase of $9,374, or 4.0 percent, from 2013 sales of $233,167. the increase was the result of a sales volume increase of 4.7 percent offset by unfavorable currency effects that reduced sales by 0.7 percent. the sales volume increase was entirely due to organic growth. sales volume increased in the united states and europe regions. growth was driven by demand for our cold material dispensing equipment in automotive and industrial end markets, coating equipment for food and beverage end markets andselect consumer durable goods end markets , partially offset by softness in uv curing equipment for electronic applications.
sales outside the united states accounted for 70.4 percent of our sales in 2014, as compared to 69.8 percent in 2013. on a geographic basis, sales in the united states were $503,776, an increase of 8.2 percent from 2013. the increase consisted of 6.1 percent organic volume and 2.1 percent from acquisitions. in the americas region, sales were $120,993, down 2.2 percent from the prior year, with volume increasing 0.8 percent offset by unfavorable currency effects of 3.0 percent. the increase in sales volume consisted of 0.5 percent from organic volume and 0.3 percent from acquisitions. sales in europe were $494,538 in 2014, up 18.7 percent from 2013, with volume increasing 16.8 and favorable currency effects of 1.9 percent. the increase in sales volume consisted of 5.3 percent from organic growth and 11.5 percent from acquisitions. sales in japan for 2014 were $127,057, a decrease of 0.7 percent from the prior year. the decrease consisted of volume growth of 7.4 percent offset by unfavorable currency effects of 8.1 percent. the increase in sales volume consisted of 5.5 percent organic volume and 1.9 percent from acquisitions. sales in the asia pacific region were $457,657, up 11.9 percent from the prior year, with volume increasing 12.1 percent, offset by unfavorable currency effects of 0.2 percent. the increase in sales volume consisted of 9.0 percent from organic growth and 3.1 percent from acquisitions.

it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenue was not material relative to 2013.
operating profit - cost of sales were $758,923 in 2014, up 12.1 percent from 2013. the increase compared to 2013 is primarily due to increased sales volume. gross profit, expressed as a percentage of sales, decreased to 55.5 percent in 2014 from 56.1 percent in 2013. the reduction in gross margin was primarily a result of product line mix, as well as a higher mix of systems revenue in our legacy business and currency effects.
selling and administrative expenses, including severance and restructuring costs, were $577,993 in 2014, an increase of $35,698, or 6.6 percent, from 2013. the increase was primarily due to the addition of acquired businesses and higher compensation expenses related to increased employment levels, partially offset by currency effects that reduced expenses.
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 33.8 percent in 2014 from 35.1 percent in 2013, due primarily to the higher level of sales and the favorable effects of continuous improvement activities.
severance and restructuring costs of $2,551 were recorded during 2014. within the adhesives dispensing systems segment, certain restructuring programs within our u.s. and european operations resulted in costs of $1,731. within the advanced technology systems segment, restructuring initiatives in the u.s. resulted in severance costs of $579. within the industrial coatings systems segment, restructuring activities in china resulted in severance costs of $241.
operating profit as a percentage of sales was 21.5 percent in 2014 compared to 21.0 percent in 2013. the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume supported by a more efficient cost structure.
operating capacity for each of our segments can support fluctuations in order activity without significant changes in operating costs. also, currency translation affects reported operating margins. operating margins for each segment were unfavorably impacted by a stronger dollar during 2014 as compared to 2013.
operating profit as a percentage of sales for the adhesive dispensing systems segment decreased to 25.5 percent in 2014 from 25.7 percent in 2013. the slight decline in 2014 was due to the dilution effect of acquired product lines in 2013.
operating profit as a percentage of sales for the advanced technology systems segment increased to 25.0 percent in 2014 from 23.9 percent in 2013. the increase was due primarily to higher sales volume supported by a more efficient cost structure.
operating profit as a percentage of sales for the industrial coating systems segment increased to 15.7 percent in 2014 from 14.5 percent in 2013. the increase was due primarily to higher sales volume supported by a more efficient cost structure.
interest and other income (expense) - interest expense in 2014 was $15,035, an increase of $194, or 1.3 percent, from 2013. the increase was due to higher borrowing levels resulting primarily from acquisitions in the second half of 2013 and 2014.
other expense in 2014 was $138 compared to other income in 2013 of $1,694. significant items included in 2014 were a gain on property insurance settlement of $1,005 and foreign currency losses of $478. significant items included in 2013 were a gain on sale of real estate in china of $2,106 and foreign currency losses of $2,214.
income taxes - income tax expense in 2014 was $105,740, or 30.0 percent of pre-tax income, as compared to $89,306, or 28.7 percent of pre-tax income in 2013.
the 2013 rate was impacted by a favorable adjustment to unrecognized tax benefits of $900 primarily related to expiration of certain foreign statutes of limitations. on january 2, 2013, the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was enacted which retroactively reinstated and extended the federal research and development tax credit (federal r&d tax credit) from january 1, 2012 to december 31, 2013 and extended certain other tax provisions. as a result, the company's income tax expense for 2013 includes a discrete tax benefit of $1,700 related to 2012.
net income - net income was $246,773, or $3.84 per diluted share, in 2014, compared to net income of $221,817, or $3.42 per diluted share in 2013. this represents an 11.3 percent increase in net income and a 12.3 percent increase in diluted earnings per share.

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased $7,954 in 2015. cash provided by operating activities was $261,951 in 2015, compared to $288,330 in 2014. the primary sources were net income adjusted for non-cash income and expenses (consisting of depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock compensation, deferred income taxes, other non-cash expense and loss on sale of property, plant and equipment) and the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options, the sum of which was $291,452 in 2015, compared to $322,529 in 2014. operating assets and liabilities used $29,501 of cash in 2015, compared to $34,199 in 2014. the primary reasons for this decrease were higher receivables due to higher year-end shipments, higher inventory investments to meet anticipated demand, partially offset by higher income taxes payable and other accrued liabilities.
cash used by investing activities was $138,535 in 2015, down from $230,525 in 2014. in the current year, cash of $75,565 was used for the liquidyn, wafo and matrix acquisitions, compared to the 2014 acquisitions of avalon laboratories and dima group b.v. which used $186,420 of cash. capital expenditures were $62,087 in 2015, up from $43,574 in the prior year. current year capital expenditures included a new facility in colorado supporting our fluid management product lines, production machinery and continued investments in our information systems platform.
cash of $110,978 was used by financing activities in 2015, compared to $53,633 in 2014. included in 2015 were net short and long-term borrowings of $325,486, compared to $153,823 in the prior year. the change was primarily due to increased borrowing for acquisitions and the purchase of treasury shares in 2015. issuance of common shares related to employee benefit plans generated $5,372 of cash in 2015, down from $7,013 in 2014, and the tax benefit from stock option exercises was $3,661 in the current year, down from $6,385 in the prior year. these decreases were the result of lower stock option exercises. in 2015 cash of $383,851 was used for the purchase of treasury shares, up from $166,434 in 2014. dividend payments were $54,849 in 2015, up from $48,391 in 2014 due to an increase in the annual dividend to $0.90 per share from $0.76 per share.
the following is a summary of significant changes by balance sheet caption from october 31, 2014 to october 31, 2015. receivables increased $23,706 primarily due to higher year-end shipments, combined with receivable balances held by liquidyn, wafo and matrix, which were all acquired in 2015. the increase of $14,801 in inventories was primarily due to acquisitions and higher inventory investments to meet anticipated demand. net property, plant and equipment increased $25,501 primarily due to capital expenditures and acquisitions, partially offset by depreciation expense. goodwill increased $29,838, due to acquisitions completed in 2015 that added $46,389 of goodwill, offset by $16,551 from the effects of currency translation. the decrease in net other intangibles of $13,884 was due to $22,081 of intangibles added as a result of the 2015 acquisitions, offset by $27,487 of amortization and $8,478 from the effects of currency translation.
the decrease in notes payable of $105,073 was primarily due to the repayment of a $100,000 short-term credit facility with pnc bank. the increase in income taxes payable of $12,056 was due to the timing of required tax payments. the increase of $3,930 in accrued liabilities was primarily due to higher compensation-related accruals. current maturities of long-term debt increased $12,091 as a result of the scheduled repayment of our new york life credit facility. the long-term debt increase of $409,775 primarily reflects $81,783 of net borrowings under our revolving credit agreement, $14,445 of net borrowings under our new york life credit facility, $200,000 of borrowings under our new term loan facility, $100,000 of borrowings from new senior notes and $77,042 of borrowings under a new euro term loan entered into with bank of america. these borrowings were offset by repayments of $51,743 under our €100,000 agreement with the bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj, ltd. and the reclassification from long-term to current maturities as mentioned above. the $6,011 decrease in long-term pension obligations and the $1,610 decrease in postretirement obligations were primarily the result of a higher valuation of plan assets, a slight increase in the global weighted-average discount rate, partially offset by compensation increases.
in december 2014, the board of directors authorized a new $300,000 common share repurchase program.  this program replaced the $200,000 program approved by the board in august 2013. uses for repurchased shares include the funding of benefit programs including stock options, restricted stock and 401(k) matching.  shares purchased are treated as treasury shares until used for such purposes.  the repurchase program is being funded using cash from operations and proceeds from borrowings under our credit facilities.
nordson corporation 31
in august 2015, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $200,000 of the company's common shares.  this new authorization adds capacity to the board's december 2014 authorization to repurchase $300,000 of shares.approximately $150,848 remained available for share repurchases at october 31, 2015.
as of october 31, 2015, approximately 88 percent of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were held at various foreign subsidiaries. deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries that are intended to be permanently invested in those operations. these undistributed earnings represent the post-income tax earnings under u.s. gaap not adjusted for previously taxed income which aggregated approximately $712,913 and $622,914 at october 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. should these earnings be distributed, applicable foreign tax credits, distributions of previously taxed income, and utilization of other attributes would substantially offset taxes due upon the distribution. it is not practical to estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable on such undistributed earnings.

(1)   in february 2015, we increased, amended and extended our existing syndicated revolving credit agreement that was scheduled to expire in december 2016. we entered into a $600,000 unsecured, multicurrency credit facility with a group of banks. this facility has a five-year term and includes a $50,000 subfacility for swing-line loans and may be increased from $600,000 to $850,000 under certain conditions. it expires in february 2020. at october 31, 2015, $457,025 was outstanding under this facility, compared to $375,242 outstanding at october 31, 2014. balances outstanding under the prior credit agreement were transferred to the new credit agreement. the weighted average interest rate for borrowings under this agreement was 1.20 percent at october 31, 2015. there are two primary financial covenants that must be met under this facility. the first covenant limits the amount of total indebtedness that can be incurred to 3.50 times consolidated trailing four-quarter ebitda (both indebtedness and ebitda as defined in the credit agreement). the second covenant requires consolidated trailing four-quarter ebitda to be at least 3.0 times consolidated trailing four-quarter interest expense (both as defined in the credit agreement). at october 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all debt covenants, and the amount we could borrow under the credit facility would not have been limited by any debt covenants.

in 2011, we entered into a $150,000 three-year note purchase and private shelf note agreement with new york life investment management llc. in 2013, the amount of the facility was increased from $150,000 to $175,000. in 2015, the amount of the facility was increased to $180,000. notes issued under the agreement may have a maturity of up to 12 years, with an average life of up to 10 years, and are unsecured. the interest rate on each note can be fixed or floating and is based upon the market rate at the borrowing date. this agreement contains customary events of default and covenants related to limitations on indebtedness and the maintenance of certain financial ratios. at october 31, 2015, there was $67,778 outstanding under this facility, compared to $53,333 at october 31, 2014. the fixed rates were 2.21 percent and 2.56 percent at october 31, 2015. we were in compliance with all covenants at october 31, 2015, and the amount we could borrow would not have been limited by any debt covenants.
nordson corporation 32
in 2012, we entered into a note purchase agreement with a group of insurance companies under which we sold $200,000 of senior notes. the notes mature between july 2017 and july 2025 and bear interest at fixed rates between 2.27 percent and 3.13 percent. we were in compliance with all covenants at october 31, 2015.
in 2013, we entered into a €100,000 agreement with the bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj, ltd. the term of the agreement is three years and can be extended by one year at the end of the third and fourth anniversaries. the interest rate is variable based upon the eur libor rate and was 0.79 percent at october 31, 2015. at october 31, 2015, there was €10,450 ($11,501) outstanding under this agreement, compared to €50,500 ($63,244) at october 31, 2014. we were in compliance with all covenants at october 31, 2015.
in april 2015, we entered into a $200,000 term loan facility with a group of banks. $100,000 is due in three years and has an interest rate spread of 0.875 percent over libor and $100,000 is due in five years and has an interest rate spread of 0.925 percent over libor. this loan was used to pay down $100,000 of our 364-day unsecured credit facility with pnc bank and $100,000 of our revolving credit facility. we were in compliance with all covenants at october 31, 2015.
in july 2015, we entered into a note purchase agreement under which $100,000 of senior unsecured notes were purchased primarily by a group of insurance companies. the notes mature in july 2025 and july 2027 and bear interest at fixed rates of 2.89 percent and 3.19 percent. we were in compliance with all covenants at october 31, 2015.
in october 2015, we entered into a €70,000 agreement with bank of america merrill lynch international limited. the term of the agreement is three years and can be extended by one year on two annual occasions if notice is given between 180 days and 30 days before the maturity date. the interest rate is variable based on the libor rate plus applicable margin based on our leverage ratio.  at october 31, 2015, the balance outstanding was €70 million ($77,042) and the interest rate was 0.875 percent over libor.  proceeds from this loan were used to pay down our revolving credit facility. we were in compliance with all covenants at october 31, 2015.
see note 10 for additional information.
(2)   see note 11 for additional information.

(3)   in 2014, we entered into a 364-day unsecured credit facility with pnc bank national association. in august 2014, we borrowed $100,000 under this facility to partially fund the avalon acquisition. in january 2015, we amended the agreement and borrowed an additional $50,000 to fund daily operations. in april 2015, we paid down $100,000 of the $150,000 outstanding. in may 2015, we paid down the remaining $50,000 outstanding.

see note 9 for additional information.
(4)   pension and postretirement plan funding amounts after 2015 will be determined based on the future funded status of the plans and therefore cannot be estimated at this time. see note 7 for additional information.

(5)   purchase obligations primarily represent commitments for materials used in our manufacturing processes that are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet.

we believe that the combination of present capital resources, cash from operations and unused financing sources are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for 2016. there are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company.
nordson corporation 33
outlook our operating performance, balance sheet position, and financial ratios for 2015 remained strong relative to recent years, although uncertainties persisted in global financial markets and the general economic environment.  going forward, we are well-positioned to manage our liquidity needs that arise from working capital requirements, capital expenditures, contributions related to pension and postretirement obligations, and principal and interest payments on indebtedness.  primary sources of capital to meet these needs as well as other opportunistic investments are cash provided by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements.  in 2015, cash from operations was 15.5 percent of revenue.  with respect to borrowing under existing loan agreements, as of october 31, 2015, we had $142,975 available capacity under our five-year term, $600,000 unsecured, multicurrency credit facility which may be increased to $850,000 under certain conditions.  this credit facility expires in february 2020.  in addition, we had $107,222 borrowing capacity remaining on our $175,000 three-year private shelf agreement with new york life investment management llc.  while these facilities provide the contractual terms for any borrowing, we cannot be assured that these facilities would be available in the event that these financial institutions failed to remain sufficiently capitalized.
other loan agreements exist with no remaining borrowing capacity, but factor into debt covenant calculations that affect future borrowing capacity.  on july 26, 2012, we entered into a note purchase agreement with a group of insurance companies under which we sold $200,000 of senior notes.  the notes mature between july 2017 and july 2025 and bear interest at fixed rates between 2.27 percent and 3.13 percent.  as of october 31, 2015, we owe €10,450 on a €100,000 three-year term loan facility entered into on august 30, 2013, with the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj, ltd.  this loan facility bears interest at variable margin rates of 0.75 percent to 1.625 percent above eur libor.  as of april 10, 2015, we entered into a $200,000 term loan facility with a group of banks.  $100,000 is due in three years and has an interest rate spread of 1 percent over libor, and $100,000 is due in five years and has an interest rate spread of 1.1% over libor.  on july 28, 2015, we entered into a note purchase agreement under which $100,000 of senior unsecured notes were purchased primarily by a group of insurance companies.  the notes consist of two tranches, series a and b at $50,000 each, maturing in july 2025 and july 2027, and bearing interest at fixed rates of 2.89 percent and 3.19 percent, respectively.  on october 05, 2015, we entered into a €70,000 three year term loan agreement with bank of america merrill lynch international limited in london.  the interest rate is variable based on the libor rate plus applicable margin based on our leverage ratio.  at october 31, 2015, the interest rate was 0.875 percent over libor.
respective to all of these loans are two primary covenants, the leverage ratio that restricts indebtedness (net of cash) to a maximum 3.50 times consolidated four-quarter trailing ebitda and the interest coverage ratio that requires four-quarter trailing ebitda to be at minimum 3.0 times consolidated trailing four-quarter interest expense.  (debt, ebitda, and interest expense are as defined in their respective credit agreements.)  with respect to these two primary covenants as of october 31, 2015, we were approximately 75 percent of the most restrictive leverage ratio and approximately 13 percent of the most restrictive interest coverage ratio.  unused borrowing capacity under existing loan agreements would amount to an additional 17 percent of the most restrictive leverage ratio.
regarding expectations for 2016, we are optimistic about longer term growth opportunities in the diverse consumer durable, non-durable, medical, electronics and industrial end markets we serve.  however, we move forward in the near-term with caution given negative currency translation effects of a much stronger u.s. dollar, continued slow growth in emerging markets, expectations for global gdp indicating a low-growth macroeconomic environment and marketplace effects of political instability in certain areas of the world.  though the pace of improvement in the global economy remains unclear, our growth potential has been demonstrated over time from our capacity to build and enhance our core businesses by entering emerging markets and pursuing market adjacencies.  we drive value for our customers through our application expertise, differentiated technology, and direct sales and service support.  our priorities also are focused on operational efficiencies by employing continuous improvement methodologies in our business processes.  we expect our efforts will continue to provide more than sufficient cash from operations for meeting our liquidity needs and paying dividends to common shareholders, as well as enabling us to invest in the development of new applications and markets for our technologies.  cash from operations have been 15 to 20 percent of revenues over the past five years, resulting in more than sufficient cash for our ordinary business requirements.  we believe our cash provided from operations and available borrowing capacity will enable us to make other opportunistic investments in our own common shares and strategic business combinations.

with respect to contractual spending, the table above presents our financial obligations as $1,320,802 of which $124,340 is payable in 2016.  in august 2015, the board of directors approved a $200,000 common share repurchase program that added capacity to the board's december 2014 approval authorizing management at its discretion to repurchase shares up to $300,000.  under the expanded $500,000 share repurchase program, a balance of $150,848 remained as of october 31, 2015.  this new authorization continues a succession of share repurchase programs authorized since 2011.  the repurchase program is funded using cash from operations and proceeds from borrowings under our credit facilities.  timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are contingent on a number of factors including levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements for acquisitions, repayment of debt and our share price.  capital expenditures for 2016 will be focused on continued investments in our information systems and projects that improve both capacity and efficiency of manufacturing and distribution operations.
effects of foreign currency the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured due to fluctuating selling prices, sales volume, product mix and cost structures in each country where we operate. as a general rule, a weakening of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income, while a strengthening of the dollar has a detrimental effect.
in 2015, as compared with 2014, the united states dollar was stronger against foreign currencies. if 2014 exchange rates had been in effect during 2015, sales would have been approximately $114,844 higher and third-party costs would have been approximately $67,414 higher. in 2014, as compared with 2013, the united states dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies. if 2013 exchange rates had been in effect during 2014, sales would have been approximately $7,002 higher and third-party costs would have been approximately $1,845 higher. these effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates.
inflation inflation affects profit margins as the ability to pass cost increases on to customers is restricted by the need for competitive pricing. although inflation has been modest in recent years and has had no material effect on the years covered by these financial statements, we continue to seek ways to minimize the impact of inflation through focused efforts to increase productivity.

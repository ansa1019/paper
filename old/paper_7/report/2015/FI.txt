overview company background we are a leading global provider of financial services technology. we provide account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking systems, and related services. we serve approximately 13,000 clients worldwide, including banks, thrifts, credit unions, investment management firms, leasing and finance companies, retailers, merchants, mutual savings banks, and building societies. the majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years and high renewal rates. most of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their businesses and are, therefore, non-discretionary in nature.
our operations are principally located in the united states and are comprised of the payments and industry products ("payments") segment and the financial institution services ("financial") segment. the payments segment primarily provides debit and credit card processing and services, electronic bill payment and presentment services, internet and mobile banking software and services, person-to-person payment services, and other electronic payments software and services. our businesses in this segment also provide card and print personalization services, investment account processing services for separately managed accounts, and fraud and risk management products and services. the financial segment provides banks, thrifts, credit unions, and leasing and finance companies with account processing services, item processing and source capture services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. corporate and other primarily consists of unallocated corporate expenses including share-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, intercompany eliminations and other costs that are not considered when management evaluates segment performance.
during 2015 and 2014, stoneriver group, l.p. ("stoneriver"), a joint venture in which we own a 49% interest and account for under the equity method, recognized net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses, and in 2013, completed a transaction which reduced its ownership interest in another subsidiary business, resulting in a gain associated with the deconsolidation. our share of the net gains and related expenses on these transactions was $29 million in 2015, $87 million in 2014 and $71 million in 2013, with related tax expenses of $13 million, $36 million and $17 million, respectively. in addition, we received cash dividends, funded from capital transactions, from stoneriver of $36 million, $110 million, and $122 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
on january 14, 2013, we acquired open solutions inc. ("open solutions"), a provider of account processing technology for financial institutions, for a cash purchase price of $55 million and the assumption of approximately $960 million of debt. with this acquisition, we added dna, a real-time, open architecture account processing system, along with 3,300 existing open solutions' clients. this acquisition advanced our go-to-market strategies by adding a number of products and services and by expanding the number of account processing clients to which we can provide our broad array of add-on solutions.
enterprise priorities we continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions that enable best-in-class results for our clients. these strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our various businesses, enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships, improving operational effectiveness, being disciplined in our allocation of capital, and differentiating our products and services through innovation. our key enterprise priorities for 2016 are: (i) to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings goals; (ii) to build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and (iii) to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients.
industry trends the market for products and services offered by financial institutions continues to evolve rapidly. the financial industry regularly introduces and implements new payment, deposit, lending, investment and risk management products, and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers. at the same time, regulatory conditions have continued to create a challenging operating environment for financial institutions. in particular, legislation such as the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act has generated, and will continue to generate, numerous new regulations that will impact the financial industry. these conditions, along with mild economic improvement, have created heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue, comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency. examples of these solutions include our electronic payments solutions and channels such as internet, mobile and tablet banking, sometimes referred to as "digital channels."
17
this increased focus on digital channels by both financial institutions and their customers, as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace, have increased the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions. we expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment. we anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes amidst an evolving marketplace. we believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments, and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions, including electronic transactions through digital channels, will continue to increase, which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us. based on these market conditions, we believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with our position as a leading provider of non-discretionary, recurring revenue-based products and services, gives us a solid foundation for growth. furthermore, we believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients.
in addition to the trends described above, the financial institutions marketplace has experienced change in composition as well. during the past 25 years, the number of financial institutions in the united states has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately 3% per year, primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions. rather than reducing the overall market, these consolidations have transferred accounts among financial institutions. an acquisition benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our system, or elects to move to one of our systems, and negatively impacts us when a competing system is selected. financial institution acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multi-year client contracts, which are primarily generated when an existing client with a multi-year contract is acquired by another financial institution. these fees can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. our revenue is diversified, and our focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services has reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us. we have clients that span the entire range of financial institutions in terms of asset size and business model, and our 50 largest financial institution clients represent less than 25% of our annual revenue. in addition, we believe that our products and services can assist financial institutions with the regulatory and market challenges that they currently face by providing, among other things, new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates.
acquisitions we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. the estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. we use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. while we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. as a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income. we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate.
goodwill and acquired intangible assets we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, determined to be at an operating segment level or one level below. when reviewing goodwill for impairment, we consider the amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit, the period of time since a reporting unit's last quantitative test, the extent a
18
reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units, and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test. when performing a qualitative test, we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values. examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price, our financial performance, market and competitive factors in our industry, and other events specific to our reporting units. if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a two-step quantitative impairment test.
the first step in the quantitative test is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. we determine the fair value of a reporting unit based primarily on the present value of estimated future cash flows. if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit's net assets, goodwill of that reporting unit is not impaired and further testing is not required. if the carrying value of the reporting unit's net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we perform the second step of the quantitative test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and any impairment charge. determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions.
our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2015 determined that our goodwill was not impaired as the estimated fair values of the respective reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying values.
we review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. no impairment of our acquired intangible assets was identified during 2015.
revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account- and transaction-based fees. revenue is recognized as services are provided and is primarily recognized under service agreements that are long-term in nature, generally three to five years, and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions. at times, however, judgment is exercised in evaluating revenue recognition, such as when a contract arrangement includes multiple product and service deliverables. due to the quantity, size and nature of our multiple element arrangements, the judgments we make in this regard are not likely to have a material impact on revenue recognition for any individual element. additionally, given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition, our revenue recognition practices generally do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations. additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
results of operations components of revenue and expenses the following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income.
processing and services processing and services revenue, which in 2015 represented 84% of our consolidated revenue, is primarily generated from account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years. revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been performed. processing and services revenue is most reflective of our business performance as a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain software applications; client support; depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses.
product product revenue, which in 2015 represented 16% of our consolidated revenue, is primarily derived from integrated print and card production sales, as well as software license sales which represented less than 4% of our consolidated revenue. cost of product includes costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials and software development; personnel; infrastructure costs; depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue.
19
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; advertising and promotional costs; depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses.
financial results in march 2013, we sold our club solutions business ("club solutions"). the 2013 results of operations and cash flows of club solutions, which were previously included within the payments segment, have been reported as discontinued operations.
the following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year. this information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

total revenue total revenue increased $188 million, or 4%, in 2015 and increased $252 million, or 5%, in 2014 compared to the prior years. foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted overall revenue growth by approximately 50 basis points in 2015. the increase in total revenue during 2015 was due to 4% revenue growth in our payments segment and 3% revenue growth in our financial segment, in each case, as compared to 2014. the increase in total revenue during 2014 was attributable to 8% revenue growth in our payments segment and 3% revenue growth in our financial segment, in each case, as compared to 2013.
revenue in our payments segment increased $115 million, or 4%, in 2015 and increased $195 million, or 8%, in 2014 compared to the prior years. payments segment revenue growth during 2015 and 2014 was driven by our recurring revenue businesses as processing and services revenue increased $129 million, or 6%, and $128 million, or 7%, in 2015 and 2014, respectively. the growth in both years was primarily due to new clients and increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our card services, bill payment and digital channels businesses, as well as our biller solutions business in 2015. product revenue decreased $14 million, or 2%, in 2015 and increased $67 million, or 10%, in 2014 compared to the prior years. the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to lower software license revenue as compared to the prior year, while the higher product revenue in 2014 was attributable to increased volumes including a higher level of card reissuances in our output solutions business, a portion of which is postage pass-through revenue that is included in both product revenue and cost of product.
revenue in our financial segment increased $76 million in 2015 and $58 million in 2014, or 3% in each year, compared to the prior years. in both 2015 and 2014, revenue growth was favorably impacted by increased processing and services revenue in our account processing and lending businesses, including higher contract termination fee revenue. this growth was partially offset by negative foreign currency fluctuations of approximately 70 basis points and 30 basis points in 2015 and 2014,
21
respectively, along with a revenue decline in our international business in 2014 due to the completion of several client implementations in 2013.
total expenses total expenses increased $87 million, or 2%, in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $103 million, or 3%, in 2014 compared to 2013. total expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 75.1%, 76.1% and 78.0% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. total expenses as a percentage of total revenue was higher in 2013 due primarily to merger and integration expenses attributed to our acquisition of open solutions.
cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to 49.4% in 2015 compared to 51.3% in 2014 and 51.6% in 2013. cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted in both 2015 and 2014 by increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses, as well as by operating efficiency initiatives across the company that have benefited our overall cost structure.
cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 86.7% in 2015 compared to 84.7% in 2014 and 89.2% in 2013. cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was negatively impacted in 2015 by increased expenses in our output solutions business associated with additional investments to expand our card manufacturing and personalization capacity. cost of product as a percentage of product revenue improved in 2014 due to higher merger and integration costs in 2013 resulting from the open solutions acquisition, including a $30 million non-cash impairment charge related to the replacement of our acumen® account processing system with dna, an open solutions account processing system.
selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue was 19.7%, 19.2% and 20.3% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2015 as compared to 2014 was largely due to increased share-based compensation and incremental costs associated with data center and real estate consolidation activities. selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue was favorably impacted by reduced professional services expenses, including merger and integration costs, in 2014 as compared to 2013.
operating income and operating margin total operating income increased $101 million, or 8%, in 2015 and $149 million, or 14%, in 2014 compared to the prior years. total operating margin increased to 24.9% in 2015 from 23.9% in 2014 and 22.0% in 2013. operating income and operating margin improvements in 2015 and 2014 were driven by scale efficiencies, expense discipline and operational effectiveness initiatives, along with lower merger and integration expenses in corporate and other related to the open solutions acquisition.
operating income in our payments segment increased $72 million, or 9%, and increased $66 million, or 9%, in 2015 and 2014, respectively, compared to the prior years. operating margins were 29.3%, 28.0% and 27.5% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, improving 130 basis points in 2015 and 50 basis points in 2014. the increases in operating income and operating margin in 2015 and 2014 were primarily due to revenue growth and scale efficiencies in a number of our businesses, including card services. during 2015, payments segment operating margin improvements were partially offset by increased expenses associated with additional investments in our biller and output solutions businesses, along with a decrease in higher-margin software license revenue. operating margin in 2014 was negatively impacted by increased postage pass-through costs in our output solutions business, which are included in both revenue and expenses.
operating income in our financial segment increased $53 million, or 7%, and increased $28 million, or 4%, in 2015 and 2014, respectively, compared to the prior years. operating margin in 2015 improved 120 basis points to 33.8% as compared to 2014, which improved 40 basis points to 32.6% from 32.2% in 2013. operating income and operating margin were positively impacted in both years by revenue growth, including higher contract termination fee revenue, along with operational effectiveness initiatives and scale efficiencies primarily in our account processing businesses.
the operating loss in corporate and other increased $24 million in 2015 and decreased $55 million in 2014 compared to the prior years, primarily due to merger, integration and other cost activity. the operating loss increase in 2015 was attributable to increased costs incurred in conjunction with the achievement of our operational effectiveness objectives, including incremental costs related to data center and real estate consolidation activities. the 2014 decrease in operating loss compared to 2013 was primarily due to reduced merger and integration costs related to the open solutions acquisition.
interest expense interest expense increased $6 million, or 4%, in 2015 compared to 2014, and was consistent in 2014 and 2013. the increase in interest expense in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the reclassification of unamortized losses on settled cash flow hedges to interest expense related to the early extinguishment of debt. a decline in average outstanding debt during 2014 was offset by slightly higher variable interest rates as compared to 2013.
22
loss on early debt extinguishment in may 2015, we redeemed our $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior notes due in 2016 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.8% senior notes due in 2017, which resulted in a pre-tax loss on early debt extinguishment of $85 million related to make-whole payments and other costs associated with redemption.
income tax provision our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 35.7% in 2015, 36.6% in 2014 and 36.5% in 2013. the lower effective tax rate in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower income tax expense associated with our share of the net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses by our unconsolidated affiliate, stoneriver. the 2014 effective income tax rate was relatively consistent with 2013 as increased deductions resulting from federal tax planning initiatives and the favorable resolution of tax matters were offset by additional income tax expense associated with our share of net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses at stoneriver.
income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate our share of the income of stoneriver was $32 million, $91 million and $80 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. during 2015 and 2014, stoneriver recognized net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses, and in 2013, completed a transaction which reduced its ownership interest in another subsidiary business, resulting in a gain associated with the deconsolidation. our share of the net gains and related expenses on these transactions was $29 million in 2015, $87 million in 2014 and $71 million in 2013.
net income per share - diluted from continuing operations net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was $2.99 in both 2015 and 2014 and $2.44 in 2013. net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was favorably impacted from our share of net transaction gains at stoneriver of $0.07 per share in 2015 and $0.20 per share in both 2014 and 2013, and was negatively impacted in 2015 by debt extinguishment and refinancing costs of $0.25 per share and in 2013 by merger and integration costs of $0.20 per share incurred due to the acquisition of open solutions. the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets also reduced net income per share-diluted from continuing operations by $0.53, $0.52 and $0.51 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
liquidity and capital resources general our primary liquidity needs are: (i) to fund normal operating expenses; (ii) to meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness; and (iii) to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. we believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flow generated by our operations, our cash and cash equivalents of $275 million at december 31, 2015 and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. the following table presents our operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

our net cash provided by operating activities, or operating cash flow, was $1.35 billion in 2015, an increase of 3% compared with $1.31 billion in 2014. this increase was primarily due to increased operating results, partially offset by a decrease in cash dividends received from our stoneriver joint venture, representing returns on our investment.
our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to repay debt and fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, rather than to pay dividends. our capital expenditures were approximately 7% and 6% of our total revenue in 2015 and 2014, respectively. capital expenditures in 2015 include $70 million related to our atlanta facility consolidation, consisting primarily of leasehold improvements and furniture and equipment, of which $25 million is offset by landlord reimbursements included in net changes in working capital and other.
in 2015 and 2014, we received cash dividends of $36 million and $110 million, respectively, from our stoneriver joint venture. these dividends, in their entirety, represented returns on our investment and are reported in cash flows from operating activities. in january 2016, we received a $140 million cash dividend from stoneriver funded from the january 2016 sale of a business interest.
on january 20, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement with aci worldwide, inc. to acquire certain assets of its community financial services business in a transaction valued at $200 million, exclusive of related tax benefits. this transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions and is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2016.
share repurchases we purchased $1.47 billion and $1.16 billion of our common stock in 2015 and 2014, respectively. on november 19, 2014 and november 18, 2015, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 20.0 million and 15.0 million shares, respectively, of our common stock. as of december 31, 2015, we had approximately 17.4 million shares remaining under these authorizations. shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans.

long-term debt (including current maturities)      $4,293              $3,790
at december 31, 2015, our long-term debt consisted primarily of $3.3 billion of senior notes, $628 million of term loan borrowings and $379 million of revolving credit facility borrowings. we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants during 2015. the december 31, 2014 debt balances above have been adjusted on a retrospective basis for the early adoption of accounting standards update no. 2015-03, simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. accordingly, debt issuance costs of $21 million and $13 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to our term loan and senior notes are reported as a direct reduction of the related debt instrument.
24
revolving credit facility in april 2015, we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement that restated our existing $2.0 billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and extended its maturity from october 2018 to april 2020. the amended and restated credit agreement also provided that our subsidiaries that were guaranteeing our obligations under the revolving credit facility were released from their respective guarantees. borrowings under the amended revolving credit facility continue to bear interest at a variable rate based on libor or on a base rate, plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. the variable interest rate on the revolving credit facility borrowings was 1.49% at december 31, 2015. there are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements. the amended revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that are substantially similar to those under our previously existing credit agreement and require us, among other things, to: (i) limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than three and one-half times consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, and (ii) maintain consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended.
term loan we maintain a term loan with a syndicate of banks that matures in october 2018 and bears interest at a variable rate based on libor or on a base rate, plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. the variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was 1.67% at december 31, 2015. a remaining scheduled principal payment of $90 million is due on december 31, 2017, with the outstanding principal balance of $540 million due at maturity. the term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described above. in april 2015, we entered into an amendment to our term loan facility to conform certain of its terms to those in the amended and restated credit agreement, including providing that our subsidiaries that were guaranteeing our obligations under the term loan facility were released from their respective guarantees.
senior notes in may 2015, we completed an offering of $1.75 billion of senior notes comprised of $850 million aggregate principal amount of 2.7% senior notes due in june 2020 and $900 million aggregate principal amount of 3.85% senior notes due in june 2025. the notes pay interest at the stated rates semi-annually on june 1 and december 1, which commenced on december 1, 2015. our 4.625% senior notes due in october 2020 and 3.5% senior notes due in october 2022 pay interest at the stated rates on april 1 and october 1 of each year. our 4.75% senior notes due in june 2021 pay interest at the stated rate on june 15 and december 15 of each year. the interest rates applicable to the senior notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. the indentures governing the senior notes contain covenants that, among other matters, limit (i) our ability to consolidate or merge into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person; (ii) our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to create or assume liens, and (iii) our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. at december 31, 2014, our $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior notes due in october 2015 were classified in the consolidated balance sheet as long-term as we had the intent to refinance this debt on a long-term basis and the ability to do so under our amended and restated revolving credit facility. in october 2015, we used our available borrowings under the amended and restated revolving credit facility to repay the $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior notes.
in may 2015, we used the net proceeds from the offering described above to redeem our $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior notes due in june 2016 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.8% senior notes due in november 2017. we recorded a pre-tax loss on early debt extinguishment of $85 million related to make-whole payments and other costs associated with this redemption. in addition, we paid scheduled december 2015 and december 2016 principal payments on the term loan totaling $180 million and repaid, at that time, outstanding borrowings under the amended and restated revolving credit facility. the remaining net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes.
in april 2015, we provided notice to the trustee under the indenture and supplemental indentures governing our outstanding senior notes that the subsidiary guarantors of the outstanding senior notes were automatically released from all of their obligations under the supplemental indentures and their respective guarantees.
other access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital, our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions. our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. as of december 31, 2015, we had a corporate credit rating of baa2 with a stable outlook from moody's
25
investors service, inc. ("moody's") and bbb with a stable outlook from standard & poor's ratings services ("s&p") on our senior unsecured debt securities.
the interest rates payable on our senior notes, term loan and revolving credit facility are subject to adjustment from time to time if moody's or s&p changes the debt rating applicable to the notes. if the ratings from moody's or s&p decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest rates are subject to increase by up to two percent. in no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates, nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes.
off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than letters of credit. the following table details our contractual cash obligations at december 31, 2015:

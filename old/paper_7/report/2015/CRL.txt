overview we are a full service, early-stage contract research organization (cro). for nearly 70 years, we have been in the business of providing the research models required in research and development of new drugs, devices, and therapies. over this time, we have built upon our original core competency of laboratory animal medicine and science (research model technologies) to develop a diverse portfolio of discovery and safety assessment services, both good laboratory practice (glp) and non-glp, which are able to support our clients from target identification through preclinical development. we also provide a suite of products and services to support our clients' manufacturing activities. utilizing our broad portfolio of products and services enables our clients to create a more flexible drug development model, which reduces their costs, enhances their productivity and effectiveness, and increases speed to market.
our client base includes all of the major global pharmaceutical companies, many biotechnology companies, cros, agricultural and industrial chemical companies, life science companies, veterinary medicine companies, contract manufacturing organizations, medical device companies, and diagnostic and other commercial entities, as well as leading hospitals, academic institutions and government agencies around the world. we currently operate approximately 64 facilities in 18 countries worldwide, which numbers exclude our insourcing solutions (is) sites.
business trends the demand for our outsourced services increased in the fiscal year 2015, as did demand for products and services to support our clients' manufacturing activities. our pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients continued to intensify their use of strategic outsourcing to improve their operating efficiency and access capabilities that they do not maintain internally. many of our large biopharmaceutical clients have refocused on their drug discovery and early-stage development efforts, after a period of greater emphasis on delivering late-stage programs to bring new drugs to market. in addition, small and mid-size biopharmaceutical clients benefited from the continued strength in the biotechnology funding environment in the fiscal year 2015, from capital markets partnering with large biopharmaceutical companies, and investment by venture capital. academia has also benefited from partnering activities, as large biopharmaceutical companies have increasingly utilized academic research capabilities to broaden the scope of their research activities.
the primary result of these trends was improved demand for our discovery and safety assessment services in the fiscal year 2015, particularly from biotechnology clients. this improvement led to capacity continuing to fill in our safety assessment facilities which were open during 2015, and in which utilization approached optimal levels. price also improved moderately in the fiscal year 2015, as industry capacity utilization continued to increase. we believe our scientific expertise, quality, and responsiveness remain key criteria when our clients make the decision to outsource to us. in order to accommodate this increased demand and maintain responsiveness to clients' needs, we opened small amounts of new capacity in the fiscal year 2015 at existing facilities and reopened our charles river massachusetts facility in the first quarter of 2016. charles river massachusetts will provide additional capacity for early-stage drug research services and is strategically located near the boston/cambridge biotechnology hub.
demand for our products and services that support our clients' manufacturing activities was also robust in the fiscal year 2015. our biologics testing solutions (biologics) business continued to benefit from increased demand for services associated with the growing proportion of biologic drugs in the pipeline and on the market. demand for our microbial solutions (formerly endotoxin and microbial detection, or emd) business also remained strong as we addressed manufacturers' requirements for a comprehensive rapid microbial testing solution. to further enhance our rapid testing portfolio, we acquired celsis in the fiscal year 2015 to expand in the non-sterile quality control testing market.
our clients' intensified focus on the earliest stages of their pipelines has been visible in increasing demand for discovery services, and the willingness to outsource new areas of their research programs. to address these emerging needs and move further upstream in the drug research and development continuum, we have significantly enhanced our discovery services capabilities over the past two years to enable us to work with clients at the earliest stages of the discovery process. we acquired
30
the discovery services businesses of argenta, biofocus, chantest, and vivopath in the fiscal year 2014, and oncotest in the fiscal year 2015. our full service, early-stage portfolio continued to lead to additional client discussions in the fiscal year 2015 regarding strategic relationships, where clients seek to outsource larger portions of their early-stage drug research programs to us.
demand for research models and certain services began to stabilize in the fiscal year 2015, particularly in north america and europe. clients' efforts to consolidate infrastructure and seek greater pipeline productivity have begun to moderate as these initiatives generate the desired benefits. we remain confident in the long-term drivers of this business because research models and services remain essential tools for our clients' drug discovery and early-stage development efforts.
acquisitions during the fiscal year 2015, we continued to make a number of strategic acquisitions designed to expand our portfolio of services to support the drug discovery and early-stage development continuum and position us as a market leader in the outsourced discovery services market. the 2015 acquisitions include:
•   in may 2015, we acquired sunrise farms, inc. (sunrise), a producer of specific-pathogen-free fertile chicken eggs and chickens used in the manufacture of live viruses. the purpose of this business acquisition was to expand the capabilities of our existing avian vaccine services (avian) business. the purchase price of the acquisition was $9.6 million.
•   in july 2015, we acquired celsis group limited (celsis), a leading provider of rapid testing systems for non-sterile bacterial contamination for the biopharmaceutical and consumer products industries. the purpose of this acquisition was to enhance our portfolio of rapid microbial detection products and services with the addition of a rapid bioburden testing product. the purchase price for celsis was $214.5 million.
•   in november 2015, we acquired oncotest gmbh (oncotest), a cro providing discovery services for oncology, one of the largest therapeutic areas for biopharmaceutical research and development spending. the purpose of this acquisition was to expand our oncology services capabilities, enabling us to provide clients with access to a more comprehensive portfolio of technologies, including patient-derived xenograft (pdx) and syngeneic models. the preliminary purchase price for oncotest was $36.0 million.
on january 6, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire wrh, inc. (wil research), a premier provider of safety assessment and contract development and manufacturing services to biopharmaceutical and agricultural and industrial chemical companies worldwide. acquiring wil research will enhance our position as a leading global early-stage cro by strengthening our ability to partner with global clients across the drug discovery and development continuum. the transaction is expected to close early in the second quarter of 2016, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. the preliminary purchase price will be approximately $585.0 million in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments. the acquisition and associated fees are expected to be financed through an expansion of our credit facility and cash. in the event the agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay wil research a termination fee of $17.5 million.
segment reporting in the second quarter of 2014, following our acquisition of argenta and biofocus, we revised our reportable segments to ensure alignment with our view of the business. we reviewed the new and existing markets addressed by the business, the recently revised go-to-market strategy, long-term operating margins, and the discrete financial information available to our chief operating decision maker, and considered how our businesses aggregated based on these qualitative and quantitative factors. based on this review, we identified three reportable segments: research models and services (rms), discovery and safety assessment (dsa), and manufacturing support (manufacturing). we reported segment results on this basis for all periods presented in this annual report on form 10-k.
31
the revised reportable segments are as follows:
research models and services                                                                            discovery and safety assessment                                                                         manufacturing support research models                                                                                         discovery services (2)                                                                                  microbial solutions research model services (1)                                                                             safety assessment                                                                                       avian biologics
(1) research model services includes genetically engineered models and services (gems), research animal diagnostic services (rads), and is.
(2) discovery services includes both the in vivo discovery business and the early discovery business. early discovery includes argenta and biofocus, which were acquired in april 2014; chantest corporation (chantest), which was acquired in october 2014; and oncotest, which was acquired in november 2015.
our rms segment includes the research models and research model services businesses. research models includes the commercial production and sale of small research models, as well as the supply of large research models. research model services includes three business units: gems, which performs contract breeding and other services associated with genetically engineered research models; rads, which provides health monitoring and diagnostics services related to research models; and is, which provides management of our clients' research operations (including recruitment, training, staffing, and management services). our dsa segment includes services required to take a drug through the early development process including discovery services, which are non-regulated services to assist clients with the identification, screening, and selection of a lead compound for drug development, and regulated and non-regulated safety assessment services. our manufacturing segment includes microbial solutions, which includes in vitro (non-animal) lot-release testing products and microbial detection, conventional and rapid quality control testing of sterile and non-sterile biopharmaceutical and consumer products and species identification services; biologics, which performs specialized testing of biologics; and avian, which supplies specific-pathogen-free fertile chicken eggs and chickens.
prior to recasting the reportable segments, the businesses were reported in two segments as follows:
research models and services                                                                                                                preclinical services research models (3)                                                                                                                         discovery services research model services (4)                                                                                                                 safety assessment endotoxin and microbial detection                                                                                                           biologics
(3) research models included avian.
(4) research model services included gems, rads, is and discovery research services. as part of the segment revisions, the former discovery research services was folded into the company's discovery services business, previously located under the preclinical services segment.
fiscal quarters our fiscal quarters consists of the 3 months ending on the last saturday on, or prior to, march 31, june 30, september 30 and december 31.
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states (u.s.). the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods and related disclosures. these estimates and assumptions are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. we base our estimates on our historical experience, trends in the industry, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe that our application of the following accounting policies, each of which require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1, "description of business and summary of significant accounting policies", to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
32
we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements:
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been provided, our price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
service revenue is generally evidenced by client contracts, which range in duration from a few weeks to a few years and typically take the form of an agreed upon rate per unit or fixed fee arrangements. such contracts typically do not contain acceptance provisions based upon the achievement of certain study or laboratory testing results. revenue of agreed upon rate per unit contracts is recognized as services are performed, based upon rates specified in the contract. in cases where performance spans reporting periods, revenue of fixed fee contracts is recognized as services are performed, measured on the ratio of outputs or performance obligations completed to the total contractual outputs or performance obligations to be provided. changes in estimated effort to complete the fixed fee contract are reflected in the period in which the change becomes known. changes in scope of work are common, especially under long-term contracts, and generally result in a change in contract value. once the parties have agreed to the changes in scope and renegotiated pricing terms, the contract value is amended and revenue is typically recognized as described above.
most contracts are terminable by the client, either immediately or upon notice. these contracts often require payment to us of expenses to wind down the project, fees earned to date or, in some cases, a termination fee. such payments are included in revenues when earned.
we recognize product revenue, net of allowances for estimated returns, rebates and discounts, when title and risk of loss pass to customers. when we sell equipment with specified acceptance criteria, we assess our ability to meet the acceptance criteria in order to determine the timing of revenue recognition. we would defer revenue until completion of customer acceptance testing if we are not able to demonstrate the ability to meet such acceptance criteria.
a portion of our revenue is from multiple-element arrangements that include multiple products and/or services as deliverables in a single arrangement, with each deliverable, or a combination of the deliverables, representing a separate unit of accounting. we allocate revenues to each element in a multiple-element arrangement based upon the relative selling price of each deliverable. revenue allocated to each deliverable is then recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met. judgments as to the identification of deliverables, units of accounting, the allocation of consideration to the deliverable, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical with respect to these arrangements.
at the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive. this evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a) the consideration is commensurate with either (1) our performance to achieve the milestone, or (2) the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone; (b) the consideration relates solely to past performance; and (c) the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. we evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone, the level of effort and investment required and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment. if a substantive milestone is achieved and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured, we recognize revenue related to the milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved. if we were to achieve milestones that we consider substantive under any of our revenue arrangements, we may experience significant fluctuations in our revenue from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on the timing of achieving such substantive milestones. in those circumstances where a milestone is not substantive, we recognize as revenue, on the date the milestone is achieved, an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the performance period that had elapsed as of the date the milestone was achieved, with the balance being deferred and recognized over the remaining period of performance. as of december 26, 2015, we had no significant milestones that were deemed substantive.
income taxes we prepare and file income tax returns based on our interpretation of each jurisdiction's tax laws and regulations. in preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred
33
tax assets. in performing this assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. in making this determination, under the applicable financial accounting standards, we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and the effects of tax planning strategies. in the event that actual results differ from our estimates, we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.
we account for uncertain tax positions using a "more-likely-than-not" threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions. we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors, that include, but are not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, information obtained during in process audit activities and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. we adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions. our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations, the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the "more-likely-than-not" threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process. we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures, including all appeals and administrative reviews; we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position; and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would re-examine the related tax position. we also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
as of december 26, 2015, our non-u.s. subsidiaries' undistributed foreign earnings included in consolidated retained earnings were $547.6 million. as of the end of fiscal year 2015, our policy with respect to the undistributed earnings of our non-u.s. subsidiaries is to maintain an indefinite reinvestment assertion as they are required to fund needs outside of the u.s. and cannot be repatriated in a manner that is substantially tax-free. this assertion is made on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis and takes into account the liquidity requirements in both the u.s. and within our foreign subsidiaries. if we decide to repatriate funds to the u.s. in the future to execute our growth initiatives or to fund any other liquidity needs, the resulting tax consequences could negatively impact our results of operations through a higher effective tax rate and dilution of our earnings. on december 18, 2015, the u.s. enacted the consolidated appropriations act, which provides for a reinstatement and extension of the controlled foreign corporation look-through rules through the fiscal year 2019. this rule allows us to access chinese and canadian cash in a more tax-efficient manner and utilize the cash outside of the u.s. without triggering residual u.s. tax. as such, we will begin accruing foreign withholding taxes to reflect this change for the years in which the rules are reinstated.
goodwill and intangible assets we use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. the determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of our acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. we utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques, such as the income approach and the cost approach, as appropriate, in establishing the fair value of intangible assets. typically, key assumptions include projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses as well as discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets.
we review definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset.
we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually, during the fourth quarter, and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. different assumptions from those made in our analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and our evaluation of goodwill for impairment.
34
we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. if we elect this option and believe, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the carrying value of goodwill is not recoverable, the quantitative two-step impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. alternatively, we may elect to not first assess qualitative factors and immediately perform the quantitative two-step impairment test. in the first step, we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. if the carrying values of the net assets assigned to the reporting units exceed the fair values of the reporting units, then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of our goodwill. if the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference.
in the fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, we performed the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test for our reporting units. fair value was determined by using a weighted combination of a market-based approach and an income approach, as this combination was deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. under the market-based approach, we utilized information about our company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples that are used to value our reporting units. under the income approach, we determined fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.
our 2015, 2014 and 2013 impairment test indicated that goodwill and other intangible assets were not impaired.
in 2014, we revised our reportable segments to align with our new view of the business following the argenta and biofocus acquisition. as a result of this reorganization, goodwill was allocated from our prior reportable segments to our new reportable segments based on the fair value of each business group within its original reporting unit relative to the fair value of that reporting unit. in addition, we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all reporting units immediately prior to the reallocation and determined that no impairment existed.
valuation and impairment of long-lived assets long-lived assets to be held and used, including property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable. factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, the following:
•   significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;
•   significant negative industry or economic trends; or
•   significant changes or developments in strategy or operations that negatively affect the utilization of our long-lived assets.
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset, net of any sublease income, if applicable, and its eventual disposition. in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written-down to their fair values. we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model. significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows, including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. we may also estimate fair value based on market prices for similar assets, as appropriate. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets. during the fiscal year 2015, we did not record any significant impairment charges to long-lived assets.
pension and other post-retirement benefit plans several of our u.s. and non-u.s. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. we recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability. this amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. we measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of our fiscal year end.
the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the expected return on plan assets, withdrawal and mortality rates, discount rate, and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. assumptions are determined based on our
35
data and appropriate market indicators, and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement date. should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation.
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. in determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we consider the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance.
the discount rate reflects the rate we would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle our current pension obligations. beginning in the fiscal year 2014, we have employed the discount rate based on a cash-flow matching analysis using towers watson's proprietary bond:link tool.  prior to the fiscal year 2014, we employed a cash-flow matching methodology, which used the spot yield curve underlying the citigroup index. the refined estimation technique permits us to more closely match cash flows to the expected payments to participants than would be possible with the previously used yield curve model. we believe such a refinement results in an estimate of the discount rate that more accurately reflects the settlement value for plan obligations than the yield curve methodology used in prior years, as it provides the ability to review the quality and diversification of the portfolio to select the bond issues that would settle the obligation in an optimal manner. this refinement reduced our benefit obligations as of december 27, 2014 by $5.5 million.
the rate of compensation increase reflects the expected annual salary increases for the plan participants based on historical experience and the current employee compensation strategy.
in the fiscal year 2014, for our u.k. and u.s. plans, we adopted newly released mortality tables and mortality improvement scales for measurement of retirement plan obligations, which increased our benefit obligations by $7.9 million as of december 27, 2014. in the fiscal year 2015, new mortality improvement scales were issued in the u.s. and the u.k. reflecting a decline in longevity projection from the 2014 releases that we adopted, which decreased our benefit obligations by $3.3 million as of december 26, 2015.
stock-based compensation we grant stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance share units (psus) to employees, and stock options and restricted stock to non-employee directors under stock-based compensation plans. we make certain assumptions in order to value and record expense associated with awards made under our stock-based compensation arrangements. changes in these assumptions may lead to variability with respect to the timing and amount of expense we recognize in connection with share-based payments.
determining the appropriate valuation model and related assumptions requires judgment. the fair value of stock options granted is calculated using the black-scholes model and the fair value of psus is calculated using a lattice model with a monte carlo simulation, both of which require the use of subjective assumptions including volatility and expected term, among others.
determining the appropriate amount to expense based on the anticipated achievement of psu's performance targets requires judgment, including forecasting the achievement of future financial targets. the estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets. the cumulative impact of any changes to our estimates is reflected in the period of change.
we also estimate forfeitures over the requisite service period when recognizing share-based compensation expense based on historical rates and forward looking factors; these estimates are adjusted to the extent that actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to materially differ, from our estimates.

interest expense interest expense for the fiscal year 2015 was $15.1 million, an increase of $3.1 million, or 26.1%, compared to $12.0 million for the fiscal year 2014. the increase was due primarily to the write-off of a portion of debt issuance costs in connection with the modification of our $970m credit facility in april 2015, interest expense related to new capital leases, and overall higher average debt due to additional borrowings related to business acquisitions.
other income (expense), net other income (expense), net was a net other income of $3.0 million for the fiscal year 2015, a decrease of $7.7 million, or 71.9%, compared to a net other income of $10.7 million for the fiscal year 2014. the decrease in other income (expense), net was driven by a decrease of $10.4 million due to a reversal of the indemnification asset associated with a pre-acquisition tax position and corresponding unrecognized tax benefit; a decrease of $5.5 million in income from our investments in limited partnerships accounted for under the equity method; and the absence of a noncash gain of $2.1 million related to assets assumed at our frederick, maryland, facility following the termination of a customer contract, which was recorded in the fiscal year 2014; partially offset by a bargain purchase gain of $9.8 million associated with the acquisition of sunrise and an increase of $0.5 million from other activity.
income taxes income tax expense was $43.4 million for the fiscal year 2015, a decrease of $4.3 million, compared to $47.7 million for the fiscal year 2014. our effective tax rate was 22.2% in the fiscal year 2015, compared to 26.8% in the fiscal year 2014. the decrease was primarily attributable to a $10.4 million reduction in unrecognized tax benefits and related interest due to the expiration of the statute of limitations associated with pre-acquisition tax positions on the forgiveness of debt and a non-taxable bargain purchase gain of $9.8 million associated with the acquisition of sunrise. these benefits were offset by a tax accrual of $6.6 million of withholding taxes in order to access cash from our canadian and chinese operations for use outside of the u.s.

interest expense interest expense for the fiscal year 2014 was $12.0 million, a decrease of $9.0 million, or 42.9%, compared to $21.0 million for the fiscal year 2013. the decrease was primarily the result of the retirement of our senior convertible debentures late in the second quarter of the fiscal year 2013, which lowered our effective interest rate.
other income (expense), net other income (expense), net was $10.7 million for the fiscal year 2014, an increase of $3.5 million, or 48.6%, compared to $7.2 million for the fiscal year 2013. the increase in other income (expense), net was driven by our investments in limited partnerships accounted for under the equity method, which increased $3.4 million, and a non-cash gain of $2.1 million related to assets assumed at our frederick, maryland facility following the termination of a customer contract, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange and other activity of $2.0 million.

income taxes income tax expense in the fiscal year 2014 increased $14.8 million, compared with the fiscal year 2013. our effective tax rate was 26.8% in the fiscal year 2014, compared to 23.8% in the fiscal year 2013. the increase was primarily attributable to current-year tax law changes, including a statutory 25% decrease in the canadian scientific research and experimental development (sr&ed) credit and an increase in the limitation of deductibility of interest expense in france. in addition, the effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2014 reflected a discrete tax cost of $1.6 million related to the nondeductible transaction costs incurred in the fiscal year 2014 for the acquisition of the early discovery businesses and a discrete tax cost of $1.2 million related to the write-off of deferred tax assets as a result of the reorganization of the company's rms u.k. entities. these increases were partially offset by a $2.1 million release of an uncertain tax position resulting from an ability to offset tax on a capital gain from an investment in a limited partnership. the fiscal year 2013 effective tax rate included a discrete tax detriment of $2.0 million related to the ongoing transfer pricing controversy with the canadian revenue authority (cra).
liquidity and capital resources we currently require cash to fund our working capital needs, pension obligations, capital expansion, acquisitions, and to pay our debt obligations. our principal sources of liquidity have been our cash flows from operations, supplemented by long-term borrowings. based on our current business plan, we believe that our existing funds, when combined with cash generated from operations and our access to financing resources, are sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future.

cash flows from operating activities represent the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our income from continuing operations for (1) non-cash operating items such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, gains (losses) on investments in limited partnerships and gains on bargain purchases, as well as (2) changes in operating assets and liabilities, which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in our results of operations. the increases in cash provided by operating activities from the fiscal year 2014 to 2015 and from the fiscal year 2013 to 2014 were primarily driven by higher income from continuing operations and changes in assets and liabilities. our days sales outstanding, which includes deferred revenue as an offset to accounts receivable in the calculation, was 51 days as of december 26, 2015, compared to 52 days as of december 27, 2014 and 56 days as of december 28, 2013.

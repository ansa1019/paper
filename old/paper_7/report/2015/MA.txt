item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of mastercard incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including mastercard international incorporated ("mastercard international") (together, "mastercard" or the "company"), included elsewhere in this report. certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2015 presentation. for 2014 and 2013, net revenue and general and administrative expenses were revised to correctly classify $32 million and $34 million, respectively, of customer incentive expenses as contra revenue instead of general and administrative expenses. this revision had no impact on net income. percentage changes provided throughout "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" were calculated on amounts rounded to the nearest thousand.

non-gaap financial information non-gaap financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company's performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap").  this report on form 10-k contains non-gaap financial measures that exclude the impact of the following special items ("special items"):
•   u.s. employee pension plan settlement charge - in 2015, the company recorded a settlement charge of $79 million ($50 million after tax or $0.04 per diluted share) relating to the termination of its qualified u.s. defined benefit pension plan in general and administrative expenses. see note 11 (pension, postretirement and savings plans) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further discussion.
•   u.k. merchant litigation settlement provision - in 2015, the company recorded a provision for a litigation settlement of $61 million ($44 million after tax or $0.04 per diluted share) relating to a merchant litigation in the u.k. see note 18 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further discussion.
•   provision for settlements relating to u.s. merchant litigations - in 2013, the company recorded an incremental net charge of $95 million ($61 million after tax or $0.05 per diluted share) related to the opt-out merchants, representing a change in its estimate of probable losses relating to these matters. see note 18 (legal and regulatory proceedings) for further discussion to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8.
mastercard excludes these special items because its management monitors significant one-time items separately from ongoing operations and evaluates ongoing performance without these amounts. mastercard presents non-gaap financial measures to enhance an investor's understanding of mastercard's ongoing operating results and to facilitate meaningful comparison of its results between periods. mastercard's management uses these non-gaap financial measures to, among other things, evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. see "overview" and "financial results" sections for the tables that provide a reconciliation of the operating results and growth to the most directly comparable gaap measure. the presentation of non-gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's related financial results prepared in accordance with gaap.
overview we recorded net income of $3.8 billion, or $3.35 per diluted share in 2015 versus net income of $3.6 billion, or $3.10 per diluted share in 2014. reported net income grew 5% in 2015 versus the comparable period in 2014.
excluding the impact of the special items, we had adjusted net income of $3.9 billion, or $3.43 per adjusted diluted share in 2015. adjusted net income increased 8% in 2015 versus the comparable period in 2014. the increase in adjusted net income was driven by:
•   net revenue growth of 2%, primarily driven by increases across our revenue categories and the impact from acquisitions, which contributed 2 percentage points of growth, partially offset by higher rebates and incentives and the impact from foreign currency translation, which decreased growth by 6 percentage points. in 2015, our processed transactions increased 12% versus the comparable period in the prior year. in 2015, our gross dollar volumes increased 13% and our cross-border volume increased 16%, both on a local currency basis, versus the comparable period in the prior year, respectively.
•   excluding the impact of special items, adjusted operating expenses in 2015 increased 3%, primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses as a result of acquisitions and higher data processing costs, partially offset by improved cost control initiatives and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and transaction gains. including the impact of special items, operating expenses increased 6% in 2015 versus the comparable period in 2014.
•   total other expense increased to $120 million in 2015 versus $27 million for the comparable period in 2014, resulting from impairment charges taken on certain investments in 2015 and higher interest expense resulting from incremental debt issued in 2014 and 2015.
•   an improved effective tax rate of 23.2% in 2015 versus an effective tax rate of 28.8% in the comparable period in 2014, due to the recognition of discrete tax benefits in 2015 resulting from the favorable impact of settlements with tax authorities and the recognition of u.s. foreign tax credit benefits.
31
•   the net impact of foreign currency translation, from the devaluation of the euro and the brazilian real, decreased 2015 net income growth by $230 million or 7 percentage points.
other financial highlights for 2015 were as follows:
•   we generated net cash flows from operations of $4.0 billion in 2015, compared to $3.4 billion in 2014.
•   we acquired two businesses for $609 million, which focus on expanding our footprint and enhancing critical capabilities, including in the area of data analytics with the acquisition of applied predictive technologies.
•   we completed a debt offering of €1.65 billion ($1.7 billion) and established a commercial paper program with authorization to issue up to $3.75 billion in outstanding notes.
•   we repurchased 38 million shares of our class a common stock for $3.5 billion in 2015.

business environment we process transactions from more than 210 countries and territories and in more than 150 currencies. net revenue generated in the united states was 39% of total revenue in each of 2015, 2014 and 2013. no individual country, other than the united states, generated more than 10% of total revenue in any such period, but differences in market growth, economic health and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries can have an impact on the proportion of revenue generated outside the united states over time. while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries, the significant concentration of our revenue generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states.
the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business. adverse economic trends (including distress in financial markets, turmoil in specific economies around the world and additional government intervention) have impacted the environment in which we operate. certain of our customers, merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands, have been directly impacted by these adverse economic conditions.
mastercard's financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies. in addition, political instability or a decline in economic conditions in the countries in which the company operates may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance. as a result, our revenue or results of operations may be negatively impacted. mastercard continues to monitor political and economic conditions around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry. notwithstanding recent encouraging trends, the extent and pace of economic recovery in various regions remains uncertain and the overall business environment may present challenges for mastercard to grow its business. for a full discussion see "risk factors - business risk" in part i, item 1a.
in addition, our business and our customers' businesses are subject to regulation in many countries. regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry. for further discussion, see note 18 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 and our risk factor in "risk factors - legal and regulatory risks" in part i, item 1a. further, information security risks for global payments and technology companies such as mastercard have significantly increased in recent years. although to date we have not experienced any material impacts relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer such losses in the future. see our risk factor in "risk factors - business risks" in part i, item 1a related to a failure or breach of our security systems or infrastructure as a result of cyber-attacks.
impact of foreign currency rates our overall operating results can be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar versus the euro and brazilian real. the functional currency of mastercard europe, our principal european operating subsidiary, is the euro, and the functional currency of our brazilian subsidiary is the brazilian real. accordingly, the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar versus the euro and brazilian real impacts the translation of our european and brazilian subsidiaries' operating results into the u.s. dollar. during 2015, the euro and the brazilian real devalued against the u.s. dollar by 16% and 28%, respectively, versus the comparable period in 2014.
the following table provides a summary of the foreign currency translational impact of changes in the u.s. dollar average exchange rates against the euro and brazilian real to our operating results for the years ended december 31, 2015, and 2014:
positive (negative) impact from foreign currency translation percent
2015                                        2014
net revenue                          (6)%                          (1)%
operating expenses                     4%                          1%
net income                           (7)%                          less than (1)%
in addition, changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume ("gdv") and gross euro volume ("gev"), which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments fees, cross-border volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives. these foreign currency impacts are incremental to the translation impacts discussed above. in
33
most non-european regions, gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to u.s. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. in europe, gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period. as a result, our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar versus primarily non-european local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus primarily european local currencies. for example, our billing in australia is in u.s. dollar, however, consumer spend in australia is in australian dollar. the foreign currency transactional impact of converting australian dollars to our billing currency in u.s. dollars will have an impact on the revenue generated. the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar is evident when gdv growth on a u.s. dollar converted basis is compared to gdv growth on a local currency basis. in 2015, gdv on a u.s. dollar converted basis increased 1% versus gdv growth on a local currency basis of 13%. in 2014, gdv on a u.s. dollar converted basis increased 10% versus gdv growth on a local currency basis of 13%. the company attempts to manage these foreign currency exposures through its foreign exchange risk management activities, which are discussed further in note 20 (foreign exchange risk management) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8.
the company generates revenue and has financial assets in countries at risk for currency devaluation. while these revenues and financial assets are not material to mastercard on a consolidated basis, they could be negatively impacted if a devaluation of local currencies occurs relative to the u.s. dollar.
financial results revenue revenue description mastercard's business model involves four participants in addition to us: cardholders, merchants, issuers (the cardholders' financial institutions) and acquirers (the merchants' financial institutions). our gross revenue is generated by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards and other devices that carry our brands and from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related products and services. our revenue is based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers. our primary revenue billing currencies are the u.s. dollar, euro and brazilian real.
the price structure for our products and services is complex and is dependent on the nature of volumes, types of transactions and type of products and services we offer to our customers. our net revenue can be significantly impacted by the following:
•   domestic or cross-border transactions;
•   signature-based or pin-based transactions;
•   geographic region or country in which the transaction occurs;
•   volumes/transactions subject to tiered rates;
•   processed or not processed by mastercard;
•   amount of usage of our other products or services; and
•   amount of rebates and incentives provided to customers.
the company classifies its net revenue into the following five categories:
1.   domestic assessments fees: domestic assessments are fees charged to issuers and acquirers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands where the merchant country and the issuer country are the same. domestic assessments include items such as card assessments, which are fees charged on the number of cards issued or assessments for specific purposes, such as acceptance development or market development programs.
2.   cross-border volume fees: cross-border volume fees are charged to issuers and acquirers based on the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands where the merchant country and the issuer country are different. in general, a cross-border transaction generates higher revenue than a domestic transaction since cross-border fees are higher than domestic fees, and in most cases also include fees for currency conversion.
34
3.   transaction processing fees: transaction processing fees are charged for both domestic and cross-border transactions and are primarily based on the number of transactions. transaction processing fees include charges for the following:
•   switching fees for the following products and services:
ø   authorization is the process by which a transaction is routed to the issuer for approval. in certain circumstances such as when the issuer's systems are unavailable or cannot be contacted, mastercard or others, on behalf of the issuer approve in accordance with either the issuer's instructions or applicable rules (also known as "stand-in").
ø   clearing is the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been successfully conducted at the point of interaction. mastercard clears transactions among customers through our central and regional processing systems.
ø   settlement is facilitating the exchange of funds between parties.
•   connectivity fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for network access, equipment and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages. these fees are based on the size of the data being transmitted through and the number of connections to the company's network.
•   other processing fees: we extend our processing capabilities in the payment value chain for issuer and acquirer solutions; payment gateways for e-commerce merchants; and mobile gateways for mobile initiated transactions.
4.   other revenues: other revenues consist of other payment-related products and services and are primarily associated with the following:
•   consulting, data analytic and research fees are primarily generated by mastercard advisors, the company's professional advisory services group.
•   safety and security services fees are for products and services we offer to prevent, detect and respond to fraud and to ensure the safety of transactions made on mastercard products. we work with issuers, merchants and governments to help deploy standards for safe and secure transactions for the global payments system.
•   loyalty and rewards solutions fees are charged to issuers for benefits provided directly to consumers with mastercard-branded cards, such as access to a global airline lounge network, global and local concierge services, individual insurance coverages, emergency card replacement, emergency cash advance services and a 24-hour cardholder service center. for merchants, we provide targeted offers and rewards campaigns and management services for publishing offers, as well as opportunities for holders of co-brand or loyalty cards and rewards program members to obtain rewards points faster.
•   program management services provided to prepaid card issuers consist of foreign exchange margin, commissions, load fees, and atm withdrawal fees paid by cardholders on the sale and encashment of prepaid cards.
•   the company also charges for a variety of other payment-related products and services, including account and transaction enhancement services, rules compliance and publications.
5.   rebates and incentives (contra-revenue): rebates and incentives are provided to certain mastercard customers and are recorded as contra-revenue.
revenue analysis gross revenue in 2015 and 2014 increased $903 million and $1.5 billion, or 7% and 13%, versus 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily driven by an increase in dollar volume of activity and number of transactions on cards carrying our brands, as well as growth in our advisors business, which includes the impact of our newly acquired data analytics business. this was partially offset by the negative impact from foreign currency translation and the local foreign currency from billing. rebates and incentives in 2015 and 2014 increased $677 million and $327 million, or 20% and 11%, versus 2014 and 2013, respectively, due to the impact from new and renewed agreements and increased volumes, partially offset by the positive impact of foreign currency translation. our net revenue in 2015 and 2014 increased 2% and 14% versus 2014 and 2013, respectively. acquisitions contributed 2 percentage points to net revenue growth in both 2015 and 2014, while foreign currency translation decreased net revenue growth by 6 percentage points and 1 percentage point in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers. in 2015, the net revenue from these customers was approximately $2.3 billion, or 24%, of total net revenue. the loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenue. in addition, as part of our business strategy, mastercard, among other efforts, enters into business agreements with customers. these agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances. see our risk factor in "risk factor - business risks" in part i, item 1a for further discussion.
the significant components of our net revenue were as follows:

excluding the impact of the special items, adjusted general and administrative expenses increased 3% in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to acquisitions and higher data processing costs, partially offset by improved cost controls, the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, lapping of the impact of the restructuring charge taken in 2014 and foreign exchange activity gains. general and administrative expenses increased 21% in 2014 compared to 2013, due to the impact of investments in our strategic initiatives, acquisitions and the restructuring charge of $87 million taken in 2014.

•   the increase in personnel expense in 2015 is due to an increase in the number of employees resulting from our acquisitions as well as the u.s. employee pension plan settlement charge of $79 million recognized in 2015, partially offset by the lapping of the restructuring charge of $87 million recorded in 2014 and improved cost controls. the increase in personnel expenses in 2014 compared to 2013 was due to an increase in the number of employees from acquisitions and employees required to support our strategic initiatives and a restructuring charge of $87 million recorded in 2014.
•   professional fees consist primarily of third-party services, legal costs to defend our outstanding litigation and the evaluation of regulatory developments that impact our industry and brand. professional fees remained consistent in 2015 and increased in 2014, primarily due to higher third-party service expenses.
•   data processing and telecommunication expense consists of expenses to support our global payments network infrastructure, expenses to operate and maintain our computer systems and other
38
telecommunication system. these expenses increased in both 2015 and 2014 due to capacity growth of our business and higher third party processing costs.
•   foreign exchange activity includes gains and losses on foreign exchange derivative contracts and the impact of remeasurement of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. see note 20 (foreign exchange risk management) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further discussion. since the company does not designate foreign currency derivatives as hedging instruments pursuant to the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, it records gains and losses on foreign exchange derivatives on a current basis, with the associated offset being recognized as the exposures materialize. during 2015, we recorded higher gains on derivative contracts, as well as balance sheet remeasurement gains related primarily to the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar versus 2014. during 2014, we recorded higher derivative gains versus the similar period in 2013.
•   other expenses include loyalty and rewards solutions, travel and meeting expenses and rental expense for our facilities. the increase in other expenses in both 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and expenses incurred to support strategic development efforts including costs associated with loyalty and rewards programs.
advertising and marketing in 2015, advertising and marketing expenses decreased 5%, mainly due to the favorable impact from foreign currency translation and lower media spend, partially offset by higher sponsorship promotions to support our strategic initiatives. advertising and marketing expenses increased 3% in 2014, mainly due to new and renewed sponsorships and increased media spend to support our strategic initiatives. see value-added solutions and marketing sections included in part i, item 1 for further discussion of our marketing strategy.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses increased 14% in 2015 and 24% in 2014. the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in both 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to higher amortization of capitalized software costs and other intangibles associated with our acquisitions.
provision for litigation settlement during 2015, the company recorded a pre-tax charge of $61 million for a litigation settlement relating to a merchant litigation in the u.k. in the fourth quarter of 2013, mastercard recorded an incremental net pre-tax charge of $95 million related to the opt-out merchants in the u.s. merchant litigation. see note 18 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further discussion.
other income (expense)
other income (expense) is comprised primarily of investment income, interest expense, our share of income (losses) from equity method investments and other gains and losses. total other expense increased to $120 million in 2015 versus $27 million for the comparable period in 2014 resulting from impairment charges taken on certain investments in 2015 and higher interest expense resulting from incremental debt issued in 2014 and 2015. total other expense increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to higher interest expense related to our debt issuance in march 2014.
income taxes the effective tax rate for 2015 was lower than the effective tax rate for 2014 primarily due to settlements with tax authorities in multiple jurisdictions. further, the information gained related to the these matters was considered in measuring uncertain tax benefits recognized for the periods subsequent to the periods settled. in addition, the recognition of other u.s. foreign tax credits and a more favorable geographic mix of taxable earnings also contributed to the lower effective tax rate in 2015.
the effective tax rate for 2014 was lower than the effective tax rate for 2013 primarily due to the recognition of a larger repatriation benefit and an increase in the company's domestic production activity deduction in the u.s. related to the company's authorization revenue, partially offset by an unfavorable mix of earnings in 2014.
during the fourth quarter of 2014, we implemented an initiative to better align our legal entity and tax structure with our operational footprint outside of the u.s. this initiative resulted in a one-time taxable gain in belgium relating to the transfer of intellectual property to a related foreign entity in the united kingdom. we believe this improved alignment will result in greater
39
flexibility and efficiency with regard to the global deployment of cash, as well as ongoing benefits in our effective income tax rate. see note 17 (income taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further discussion.
the provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate of 35% to pretax income for the years ended december 31, as a result of the following:

the company's gaap effective tax rates for 2015 and 2013 were affected by the tax benefits related to the special items as previously discussed.
during 2015, the company's unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken during the current and prior periods decreased by $183 million. the decrease in the company's unrecognized tax benefits for 2015 was primarily due to settlements with tax authorities in multiple jurisdictions. further, the information gained related to these matters was considered in measuring uncertain tax benefits recognized for the periods subsequent to the periods settled. as of december 31, 2015, the company's unrecognized tax benefits related to positions taken during the current and prior period were $181 million, all of which would reduce the company's effective tax rate if recognized. within the next twelve months, we believe that the resolution of certain federal, foreign and state and local tax examinations is reasonably possible and that a change in estimate, reducing unrecognized tax benefits, may occur. it is not possible to provide a range of the potential change until the examinations progress further or the related statute of limitations expire.
in 2010, in connection with the expansion of the company's operations in the asia pacific, middle east and africa region, the company's subsidiary in singapore, mastercard asia pacific pte. ltd. ("mappl"), received an incentive grant from the singapore ministry of finance. see note 17 (income taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further discussion.
liquidity and capital resources we need liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations, credit and settlement exposure, capital expenditures, investments in our business and current and potential obligations. the company generates the cash required to meet these needs through operations. the following table summarizes the cash, cash equivalents, investments and credit available to the company at december 31:
2015                                                                2014              2013

1 investments include available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities.  at december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, this amount excludes restricted cash related to the u.s. merchant class litigation settlement of $541 million, $540 million and $723 million, respectively.
2 other than for business continuity planning, we did not use any funds from the line of credit during the periods presented.
cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries (i.e., any entities where earnings would be subject to u.s. tax upon repatriation) was $3.3 billion and $2.6 billion at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, or 48% and 42% as of such dates. the decrease in cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our domestic subsidiaries during 2015 was primarily driven by our use of cash in the u.s. to fund our share repurchases and dividend activity. it is our present intention to permanently
40
reinvest the undistributed earnings associated with our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31, 2015 outside of the united states (as disclosed in note 17 (income taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8), and our current plans do not require repatriation of these earnings. if these earnings are needed for u.s operations or can no longer be permanently reinvested outside of the united states, the company would be subject to u.s. tax upon repatriation.
our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions. the company guarantees the settlement of many mastercard, cirrus and maestro-branded transactions between our issuers and acquirers. see note 19 (settlement and other risk management) to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 for a description of these guarantees. historically, payments under these guarantees have not been significant; however, historical trends may not be an indication of the future. the risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers, but may also be driven significantly by regional or global economic conditions, including, but not limited to the health of the financial institutions in a country or region.
our liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. see our risk factor in "risk factors - legal and regulatory risks" in part i, item 1a and note 18 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8; and part ii, item 7 (business environment) for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business.

net cash provided by operating activities for 2015 increased $636 million as compared to 2014, primarily due to lower prepaid taxes and higher net income, partially offset by timing of customer settlements. net cash provided by operating activities for 2014 as compared to 2013, decreased by $728 million, primarily due to higher prepaid income taxes associated with our legal entity and tax reorganization.
the $1.4 billion decrease in investing activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the higher proceeds from the sales and maturities of investment securities in the prior year. the $694 million increase in investing activity in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to increased sales of investment securities in 2014.
net cash used in financing activities for 2015 as compared to 2014 increased by $119 million, primarily due to higher dividends paid and an increase in purchases of treasury stock in 2015, partially offset by increased proceeds from debt in 2015. net cash used in financing activities in 2014 as compared to 2013 decreased by $290 million, primarily due to proceeds from debt issued in 2014, partially offset by higher purchases of treasury stock and dividends in 2014.

the company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents and investment securities balances, its cash flow generating capabilities, its borrowing capacity and its access to capital resources are sufficient to satisfy its future operating cash needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations and potential obligations.

debt and credit availability in december 2015, the company issued €1.65 billion aggregate principal amount of notes. this offering consisted of €700 million aggregate principal amount of notes due 2022, €800 million aggregate principal amount of notes due 2027 and €150 million aggregate principal amount of notes due 2030 (collectively the "euro notes"). in march 2014, the company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes due 2019 and $1 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due 2024 (collectively the "usd notes"). the company is not subject to any financial covenants under the euro notes and the usd notes (collectively the "notes"). the notes are senior unsecured obligations and would rank equally with any future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. the proceeds of the notes are to be used for general corporate purposes.
in november 2015, the company established a commercial paper program (the "commercial paper program"). under the commercial paper program, the company is authorized to issue up to $3.75 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. in conjunction with the commercial paper program, the company entered into a committed unsecured $3.75 billion revolving credit facility (the "credit facility") in october 2015, which expires in 2020. the credit facility amended and restated the company's prior credit facility.
borrowings under the commercial paper program and the credit facility are to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by the company's customers. the company may borrow and repay amounts under the commercial paper program and credit facility from time to time for business continuity and planning purposes. mastercard had no borrowings under the credit facility at december 31, 2015 and 2014, as well as had no borrowings under the commercial paper program at december 31, 2015.
see note 12 (debt) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further discussion on the notes, the commercial paper program and the credit facility.
in june 2015, the company filed a universal shelf registration statement to provide additional access to capital, if needed. pursuant to the shelf registration statement, the company may from time to time offer to sell debt securities, preferred stock, class a common stock, depository shares, purchase contracts, units or warrants in one or more offerings.
dividends and share repurchases mastercard has historically paid quarterly dividends on its outstanding class a common stock and class b common stock. subject to legally available funds, we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend. however, the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs. the following table summarizes the annual, per share dividends paid in the years reflected:

shares in the company's common stock that are repurchased are considered treasury stock. the timing and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the operating needs of the business, legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. in december 2015, the company's board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its class a common stock. this program became effective in february 2016. we typically complete a share repurchase program before a new program becomes effective.

2 amounts primarily relate to sponsorships to promote the mastercard brand. future cash payments that will become due to our customers under agreements which provide pricing rebates on our standard fees and other incentives in exchange for transaction volumes are not included in the table because the amounts due are contingent on future performance. we have accrued $2.1 billion as of december 31, 2015 related to customer and merchant agreements.
3 amounts relate to severance and expected funding requirements for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans.
4 the company has recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $181 million at december 31, 2015. within the next twelve months, the company believes that the resolution of certain federal, foreign and state and local examinations are reasonably possible and that a change in estimate, reducing unrecognized tax benefits, may occur. it is not possible to provide a range of the potential change until the examinations progress further or the related statute of limitations expire. these amounts have been excluded from the table since the settlement period of this liability cannot be reasonably estimated. the timing of these payments will ultimately depend on the progress of tax examinations with the various authorities.
seasonality the company does not experience meaningful seasonality. no individual quarter in 2015, 2014 or 2013 accounted for more than 30% of net revenue.

critical accounting estimates the application of u.s. gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect the company's reported financial condition. we have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that the company considers to be the most critical to its financial statements. an accounting estimate is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the company's financial condition. senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of the company's board of directors. the company's significant accounting policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in note 1 (summary of significant accounting policies) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8.
revenue recognition application of the various accounting principles in u.s. gaap related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires the company to make judgments and estimates.  specifically, complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. domestic assessment revenue requires an estimate of our customers' performance in order to recognize this revenue. rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue based on these estimates. we consider various factors in estimating customer performance, including a review of specific transactions, historical experience with that customer and market and economic conditions. differences between actual results and the company's estimates are adjusted in the period the customer reports actual performance. if our customers' actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, net revenue may be materially different.
loss contingencies the company is currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. the company regularly reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses its potential financial exposure. if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. as additional information becomes available, the company reassesses the potential liability related to its pending claims and litigation and may revise its estimates. due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes. see note 18 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further discussion.
income taxes in calculating our effective tax rate, we need to make estimates regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items which will adjust the pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions. through our interpretation of local tax regulations, adjustments to pretax income for income earned in various tax jurisdictions are reflected within various tax filings. although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may be materially different than the estimated amounts.
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. significant judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance. we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. if it is determined that we are able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of the net carrying value or to the extent we are unable to realize a deferred tax asset, we would adjust the valuation allowance in the period in which such a determination is made, with a corresponding increase or decrease to earnings.
we record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, which may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. we consider all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether any benefit resulting from an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and, if so, how current law impacts the amount reflected within these financial statements. if upon examination, we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained, this would decrease or increase earnings in the period. in certain situations, the company will have offsetting tax credits or taxes in other jurisdictions.

we do not record u.s. income tax expense for foreign earnings which we intend to reinvest indefinitely to expand our international operations. we consider business plans, planning opportunities, and expected future outcomes in assessing the needs for future expansion and support of our international operations. if our business plans change or our future outcomes differ from our expectations, u.s. income tax expense and our effective tax rate could increase or decrease in that period.
valuation of assets the valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and assumptions. the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the company to estimate the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. impairment testing for assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required, an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets. the company's estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. these valuations require the use of management's assumptions, which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.
we evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. the impairment evaluation utilizes a quantitative assessment using a two-step impairment test. the first step is to compare the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, to the fair value. the company uses a market approach for estimating the fair value of its reporting unit. if the fair value exceeds the carrying value, then no potential impairment is considered to exist. if the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the second step is performed to determine if the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit. an impairment charge would be recorded if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value. the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a qualitative assessment to evaluate all relevant events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets.  in performing the qualitative assessment, we consider relevant events and conditions, including but not limited to, macroeconomic trends, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, cost factors, company-specific events, and legal and regulatory factors. if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than their carrying amounts, the company must perform a quantitative impairment test.

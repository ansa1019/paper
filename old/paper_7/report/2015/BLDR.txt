●   siding, metal, and concrete. siding, metal, and concrete includes vinyl, composite, and wood siding, other exteriors, and cement.

●   other building products &amp; services. other building products &amp; services are comprised of products such as cabinets and hardware as well as services such as turn-key framing, shell construction, design assistance, and professional installation spanning the majority of our product categories.

our operating results are dependent on the following trends, events and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control:
●   homebuilding industry. our business is driven primarily by the residential new construction market, which is in turn dependent upon a number of factors, including demographic trends, interest rates, consumer confidence, employment rates, foreclosure rates, and the health of the economy and mortgage markets. during the housing downturn, which began in 2006, many homebuilders significantly decreased their starts because of lower demand and an excess of home inventory. the housing market started to strengthen in 2011. according to the u.s. census bureau, annual u.s. single-family housing starts were 714,700 in 2015. however, single-family housing starts remain well below the historical average (from 1959 through 2015) of 1.0 million per year. due to the lower levels in housing starts and increased competition for homebuilder business, we have and will continue to experience pressure on our gross margins. we still believe there are several meaningful trends that indicate u.s. housing demand will likely recover in the long term and that the recent downturn in the housing industry is likely a trough in the cyclical nature of the residential construction industry. these trends include relatively low interest rates, the aging of housing stock, and normal population growth due to immigration and birthrate exceeding death rate. industry forecasters, including the national association of homebuilders ("nahb"), expect to see continued improvement in housing demand over the next few years.

25
●   targeting large production homebuilders. over the past ten years, the homebuilding industry has undergone consolidation, and the larger homebuilders have increased their market share. we expect that trend to continue as larger homebuilders have better liquidity and land positions relative to the smaller, less capitalized homebuilders. our focus is on maintaining relationships and market share with these customers while balancing the competitive pressures we are facing in servicing large homebuilders with certain profitability expectations. we expect that our ability to maintain strong relationships with the largest builders will be vital to our ability to expand into new markets as well as grow our market share. additionally, we have been successful in expanding our custom homebuilder base while maintaining acceptable credit standards.

●   repair and remodel end market. following the acquisition of probuild, the repair and remodel end market now comprises a larger portion of our business. although it is influenced by housing starts to a lesser degree than the homebuilding market, the repair and remodel end market is still dependent upon some of the same factors as the homebuilding market, including demographic trends, interest rates, consumer confidence, employment rates, foreclosure rates, and the health of the economy and home financing markets. we expect that our ability to remain competitive in this space as well as grow our market share will depend on our continued ability to provide a high level of customer service coupled with a broad product offering.

●   use of prefabricated components. prior to the housing downturn, homebuilders were increasingly using prefabricated components in order to realize increased efficiency and improved quality. shortening cycle time from start to completion was a key imperative of the homebuilders during periods of strong consumer demand. during the housing downturn, that trend decelerated as cycle time had less relevance. customers who traditionally used prefabricated components, for the most part, still do. however, the conversion of customers to this product offering slowed during the downturn. we are now seeing the demand for prefabricated components increase as the residential new construction market continues to strengthen and the availability of skilled construction labor remains limited.

●   economic conditions. economic changes both nationally and locally in our markets impact our financial performance. the building products supply industry is highly dependent upon new home construction and subject to cyclical market changes. our operations are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in supply and demand, national and local economic conditions, labor costs, competition, government regulation, trade policies and other factors that affect the homebuilding industry such as demographic trends, interest rates, single-family housing starts, employment levels, consumer confidence, and the availability of credit to homebuilders, contractors, and homeowners. beginning in 2007, the mortgage markets experienced substantial disruption due to increased defaults. this resulted in a stricter regulatory environment and reduced availability of mortgages for potential homebuyers due to an illiquid credit market and tighter standards to qualify for mortgages. mortgage financing and commercial credit for smaller homebuilders continue to be constrained, although there have been recent signs of easing. as the housing industry is dependent upon the economy as well as potential homebuyers' access to mortgage financing and homebuilders' access to commercial credit, it is likely that the housing industry will not fully recover to the historical average until conditions in the economy and the credit markets further improve.

●   cost of materials. prices of wood products, which are subject to cyclical market fluctuations, may adversely impact operating income when prices rapidly rise or fall within a relatively short period of time. we purchase certain materials, including lumber products, which are then sold to customers as well as used as direct production inputs for our manufactured and prefabricated products. short-term changes in the cost of these materials, some of which are subject to significant fluctuations, are sometimes passed on to our customers, but our pricing quotation periods may limit our ability to pass on such price changes. we may also be limited in our ability to pass on increases on in-bound freight costs on our products. our inability to pass on material price increases to our customers could adversely impact our operating results.

●   controlling expenses. another important aspect of our strategy is controlling costs and enhancing our status as a low-cost building materials supplier in the markets we serve. we pay close attention to managing our working capital and operating expenses. we have a "best practices" operating philosophy, which encourages increasing efficiency, lowering costs, improving working capital, and maximizing profitability and cash flow. we constantly analyze our workforce productivity to achieve the optimum, cost-efficient labor mix for our facilities. further, we pay careful attention to our logistics function and its effect on our shipping and handling costs.

·   expand into multi-family and light commercial business. our primary focus has been, and continues to be, on single-family residential new construction. however, we will continue to identify opportunities for profitable growth in the multi-family and light commercial markets.

26
·   successful integration of the probuild business: the acquisition of probuild has substantially increased the scale of our company. successfully integrating probuild will be critical to achieving our future objectives. combining our two companies may be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected, which could result in the acquisition not achieving its intended results, including the expected operational synergies and cost savings. in addition, as a result of the probuild acquisition we have substantially increased indebtedness. reduction of our outstanding debt will be a key imperative as we work to achieve the intended results of the acquisition.

recent developments acquisitions on february 9, 2015, the company acquired certain assets and the operations of timber tech texas, inc. and its affiliates ("timber tech") for $5.8 million in cash (including certain adjustments). timber tech is based in cibolo, texas, which is approximately 25 miles northeast of downtown san antonio. timber tech is a manufacturer of roof trusses, floor trusses, wall panels and sub-components, as well as a supplier of glue laminated timber and veneer lumber beams.
on july 31, 2015, we acquired all of the operating affiliates of probuild through the purchase of all issued and outstanding equity interests of probuild for $1.63 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments. previously headquartered in denver, colorado, probuild is one of the nation's largest professional building materials suppliers. we believe that the probuild acquisition will lead to greater diversification and scale, an improved geographic footprint, and significant potential cost savings. in addition, we bring to probuild significant sales expertise in value-added products, which we believe, when combined with probuild's diverse customer base, will result in enhanced sales growth of higher margin products for the company.
the probuild purchase price was funded with the net cash proceeds from (i) the sale of $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 10.75% senior unsecured notes due 2023 ("2023 notes"), (ii) the entry into a new $600.0 million term loan credit agreement ("2015 term loan"), (iii) a $295.0 million draw on an amended and restated $800.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility ("2015 facility"), and (iv) a public offering of 9.2 million new shares of our common stock at an offering  price of $12.80 per share, subject, in each case, to applicable discounts, commissions, fees, and expenses.
the probuild and timber tech transactions were accounted for by the acquisition method, and accordingly their results of operations were included in the company's consolidated financial statements from the respective acquisition dates. the purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired based on estimated fair values at the acquisition date, with the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill.
current operating conditions and outlook though the level of housing starts remains below the historical average, the homebuilding industry has shown improvement since 2011. according to the u.s. census bureau, actual u.s. single-family housing starts for 2015 were 714,700, an increase of 10.3% compared to 2014. u.s single-family units under construction increased 11.1% during this same time period. while the housing industry has strengthened over the past few years, the limited availability of credit to smaller homebuilders and potential homebuyers and the slow economic recovery, among other factors, have hampered a stronger recovery. a composite of third party sources, including the nahb, are forecasting 825,000 u.s. single-family housing starts for 2016, which is an increase of 15.4% from 2015.
our net sales for the year ended december 31, 2015 were up 122.2% over the same period last year, 119.1% of which was due to recent acquisitions, primarily the acquisition of probuild. excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, which are described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, net sales increased 3.1%. we estimate net sales increased 8.5% due to increased volume, which was partially offset by a 5.4% decrease due to the impact of commodity price deflation on net sales. our gross margin percentage increased by 3.0% during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. excluding the impact of the probuild acquisition, our gross margin percentage increased 1.7%, primarily due to improved customer pricing relative to our costs and a higher mix of value-added sales. we made significant changes to our business during the downturn that have improved our operating efficiency and allowed us to better leverage our operating costs against changes in sales volume. we intend to implement similar changes in probuild's business activities to the extent feasible. however, our selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 22.7% for the year ended december 31, 2015, a 3.6% increase from 19.2% in 2014. excluding probuild, selling, general, and administrative expenses were 22.0% of net sales. the increase was primarily due to acquisition costs related to the probuild acquisition, an increase in facility closure costs associated with location consolidations, and an increase in intangible asset amortization.
27
as a result of the probuild acquisition, we have substantially increased indebtedness. as such, reduction of our outstanding debt is a key area of focus for the company. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we repaid $235.0 million of the original $295.0 million borrowed under the 2015 facility at the closing of the acquisition. in addition, we repaid $1.4 million on the 2015 term loan during the same period.
on february 12, 2016, we completed separate privately negotiated note exchange transactions in which $218.6 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2023 notes was exchanged for $207.6 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.625% senior secured notes due 2021 ("2021 notes"). the 2021 notes were issued under the existing indenture dated as of may 29, 2013.
on february 29, 2016, we completed additional privately negotiated note exchange transactions in which $63.8 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2023 notes was exchanged for $60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.625% senior secured notes due 2021 ("2021 notes"). following these transactions $617.6 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2021 notes and $417.6 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2023 notes remain outstanding.
these transactions allowed the company to reduce its long-term debt by approximately $14.8 million and reduce its annual cash interest expense by approximately $10.0 million.
we still believe the long-term outlook for the housing industry is positive due to growth in the underlying demographics. we feel we are well-positioned to take advantage of the construction activity in our markets and to continue to increase our market share, which may include strategic acquisitions. we will continue to focus on working capital by closely monitoring the credit exposure of our customers and by working with our vendors to improve our payment terms and pricing on our products. we will also continue to work diligently to achieve the appropriate balance of short-term expense control while maintaining the expertise and capacity to grow the business as market conditions improve. we want to create long-term shareholder value and avoid taking steps that will limit our ability to compete.

due to the probuild acquisition, we achieved increased net sales across all product categories.  our sales classification by product categories has shifted as we diversified our product offerings to support a broader customer base across 40 states through the probuild acquisition. excluding probuild, net sales increased across all product categories, except lumber & lumber sheet goods, which decreased $12.4 million. this decline in net sales of lumber and lumber sheet goods, excluding probuild, was largely due to an 11.1% decrease in market prices for such commodities in 2015 compared to 2014, which was mostly offset by an increase in sales volume.
gross margin. gross margin increased $544.5 million to $901.5 million. of this increase, $493.3 million is due to the probuild acquisition. excluding probuild, gross margin increased $51.2 million. our gross margin percentage increased to 25.3% in 2015 from 22.3% in 2014, a 3.0% increase. excluding probuild, our gross margin percentage increased 1.7%, primarily due to improved customer pricing relative to our costs and a higher mix of value-added sales from our manufactured products categories in 2015 compared to 2014.
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses increased $503.9 million, or 164.1%. excluding probuild, our selling, general, and administrative expense increased $68.0 million or 22.2%. excluding probuild, our salaries and benefits expense, excluding stock compensation expense, was $218.4 million, an increase of $27.3 million from 2014, largely due to a 6.2% increase in full-time equivalent employees related to increased sales volume and other recent acquisitions. office general and administrative expense increased $31.2 million, primarily due to a $30.2 million increase in professional service fees largely attributable to acquisition and integration costs related to the probuild acquisition. facility closure costs increased $3.6 million primarily due to costs associated with location consolidations following the probuild acquisition. intangible asset amortization increased $1.6 million due to other recent acquisitions.  delivery expense increased $1.7 million largely due to increased sales volume.
as a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 19.2% in 2014 to 22.7% in 2015. excluding probuild, selling, general and administrative expenses were 22.0% of net sales. as a percentage of net sales, salaries and benefits expense, excluding stock compensation expense, increased 0.9%, office general and administrative expense increased 1.7%, facility closure costs increased 0.2%, intangible asset amortization increased 0.1% and delivery expenses decreased 0.1%. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, was primarily due to the factors discussed above, and to a lesser degree, the negative impact of commodity price deflation on our net sales.
interest expense, net. interest expense was $109.2 million in 2015, an increase of $78.9 million from 2014. excluding interest expense attributable to probuild, which is primarily related to interest expense associated with lease finance obligations, our interest expense was $101.0 million, an increase of $70.7 million. the increase was primarily related to the financing transactions associated with the acquisition of probuild. of the $70.7 million increase, $49.5 million was attributable primarily to increased interest expense related to our 2023 notes, 2015 term loan and 2015 facility, $13.2 million was due to commitment fees related to unutilized bridge and backstop facilities, $8.3 million was related to non-cash interest expense from the amortization of debt discount and deferred loan costs, and fair value adjustments related to our previously outstanding stock warrants in 2014.
income tax expense. we recorded income tax expense of $4.4 million and $1.1 million during 2015 and 2014, respectively. we recorded an increase in the after-tax, non-cash valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets of $9.7 million in 2015 and a $7.2 million reduction in the after-tax, non-cash valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets in 2014. absent the valuation allowance, our effective tax rate would have been 28.5% and 42.1% for 2015 and 2014, respectively.
2014 compared with 2013
sales. sales for the year ended december 31, 2014 were $1,604.1 million, a 7.7% increase from sales of $1,489.9 million for 2013. excluding the impact of recent acquisitions our sales grew 5.8% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior
29
year. according to the u.s census bureau, actual u.s. single-family housing starts increased 4.8% in 2014 as compared to 2013. in the south region, actual single-family starts increased 6.0% compared to 2013, and single-family units under construction increased 14.0% over this same time period. excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, we estimate sales increased 7.9% due to increased volume, which was partially offset by a 2.1% decrease due to the impact of commodity price deflation on sales, while sales increased an additional 1.9% due to recent acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year.

increased sales were achieved across all product categories, except lumber and lumber sheet goods, primarily due to increased volume. the decrease in sales for lumber and lumber sheet goods is primarily attributable to the impact of commodity price deflation, which was mostly offset by an increase in volume, for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year.
gross margin. gross margin increased $37.1 million to $357.0 million. our gross margin percentage increased from 21.5% in 2013 to 22.3% in 2014, a 0.8% increase. our gross margin percentage increased primarily due to improved customer pricing and lower volatility in commodity lumber prices during the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year.
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses increased $34.6 million, or 12.7%. our salaries and benefits expense, excluding stock compensation expense, was $191.1 million for 2014, an increase of $19.4 million from 2013. delivery expenses increased $5.9 million and office general and administrative expense increased $4.3 million primarily due to increased sales volume. occupancy expenses increased $3.0 million, primarily due to acquisitions and expansions at existing facilities.
as a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 18.2% in 2013 to 19.1% in 2014. as a percentage of sales, salaries and benefits expense, excluding stock compensation expense, increased 0.4%, delivery costs increased by 0.1%, our office general and administrative expense increased 0.1% and occupancy expenses increased by 0.1%. these increases were primarily due to the negative impact of commodity lumber price deflation on our sales during 2014.
interest expense, net. interest expense was $30.3 million in 2014, a decrease of $59.3 million from 2013. the decrease is primarily related to our refinancing in the second quarter of 2013, which included $10.6 million of interest on our then outstanding $225.0 million first-lien term loan due 2015 ("term loan"), the write-off of $6.8 million in unamortized debt discount and $2.1 million of debt issuance costs, and a $39.5 million prepayment premium related to the early termination of the term loan.
income tax expense. we recorded income tax expense of $1.1 million and $0.8 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively. we recorded a $7.2 million reduction to our valuation allowance due to utilization of net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our taxable income in 2014. we recorded an after-tax, non-cash valuation allowance of $15.3 million related to our net deferred tax assets for 2013, which is exclusive of $0.6 million primarily related to reversals of uncertain tax positions due to statute expirations that affected our net operating loss carryforward and valuation allowance. absent this valuation allowance, our effective tax rate would have been 42.1% and 35.0% for 2014 and 2013, respectively.

as a result of our reorganization following the probuild acquisition on july 31, 2015, we now have four reportable segments based on an aggregation of the geographic regions in which we operate: northeast, southeast, south and west.  the west reportable segment operations were acquired through the probuild acquisition. the other reportable segments represent a mix of legacy builders firstsource and probuild locations.
excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, net sales for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014 increased 4.5% and 5.9% in our legacy southeast and south reportable segments, respectively, primarily due to volume increases, which were partially offset by commodity price deflation.  according to the u.s census bureau, the actual u.s. single-family housing starts increased 10.3% in 2015 as compared to 2014, with single family starts in the south region increasing 12.0% compared to 2014.  excluding probuild, net sales for our northeast reportable segment decreased 2.7% for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 2014 due to slower regional sales growth, which was not enough to overcome the impact of commodity price deflation.
excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, net sales for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 increased 3.4% and 11.2% in our southeast and south reportable segments, respectively, due to volume increases which outpaced the commodity price deflation offset.  according to the u.s census bureau, the actual u.s. single-family housing starts increased 4.8% in 2014 as compared to 2013, with single family starts in the south region ahead of the national average increasing 6.0% compared to 2013.  excluding probuild, net sales for our northeast reportable segment decreased 4.1% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013 due to slower regional sales growth, which was not enough to overcome the commodity price deflation impact.
liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are to fund working capital needs and operating expenses, meet required interest and principal payments, and to fund capital expenditures and potential future acquisitions. our capital resources at december 31, 2015 consist of cash on hand and borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility.
our 2015 facility will be primarily used for working capital, general corporate purposes, and funding acquisitions. in addition, we may use the 2015 facility to facilitate debt consolidation. availability under the 2015 facility is determined by a borrowing base. our borrowing base consists of trade accounts receivable, inventory, other receivables, including progress billings and credit card receivables, and qualified cash that all meet specific criteria contained within the credit agreement, minus agent specified reserves. net excess borrowing availability is equal to the maximum borrowing amount minus outstanding borrowings and letters of credit.

net excess borrowing availability on revolving facility                                            $618.7
as of december 31, 2015, we had $60.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our 2015 facility and our net excess borrowing availability was $618.7 million after being reduced by outstanding letters of credit of approximately $79.1 million. excess availability must equal or exceed a minimum specified amount, currently $80.0 million, or we are required to meet a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1:00 to 1:00. we were not in violation of any covenants or restrictions imposed by any of our debt agreements at december 31, 2015.
liquidity our liquidity at december 31, 2015 was $683.8 million, which consists of net borrowing availability under the 2015 facility and cash on hand. we are expecting increased stability and continued improvement in the housing industry in 2016. beyond 2016, it is difficult for us to predict what will happen as our industry is dependent on a number of factors, including national economic conditions, employment levels, the availability of credit for homebuilders and potential home buyers, the level of foreclosures, existing home inventory, and interest rates.
we have substantially increased indebtedness following completion of the probuild acquisition in comparison to our indebtedness on a recent historical basis, which will increase our interest expense and could have the effect of, among other things, reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions. from time to time, based on market conditions and other factors and subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the company may repurchase or call the 2021 notes or 2023 notes, repay debt, or otherwise enter into transactions regarding its capital structure.
should the current industry conditions deteriorate or we pursue additional acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional funds through the sale of common stock or debt in the public capital markets or in privately negotiated transactions. there can be no assurance that any of these financing options would be available on favorable terms, if at all. alternatives to help supplement our liquidity position could include, but are not limited to, idling or permanently closing additional facilities, adjusting our headcount in response to current business conditions, attempts to renegotiate leases, and divesting of non-core businesses. there are no assurances that these steps would prove successful.
consolidated cash flows cash provided by operating activities was $177.0 million and $27.5 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. our working capital decreased $99.0 million in 2015 compared to an increase of $7.8 million in 2014. the decrease in working capital is primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in accrued liabilities. the decrease in accounts receivable is due to increased collections largely attributable to the probuild acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2015. the increase in accrued liabilities is largely due to increased interest payable following the probuild acquisition financing transactions. the decrease in working capital was partially offset by an increase in cash interest payments of $26.7 million in 2015 compared to 2014. in addition, during 2015 we had $13.2 million in one-time cash interest payments attributable to commitment fees related to unutilized bridge and backstop financing
32
facilities.  the remaining increase in cash provided by operations is primarily related to increased sales and profitability during 2015 as a result of higher sales volume and the acquisition of probuild.
cash provided by operating activities was $27.5 million in 2014 compared to cash used in operating activities of $47.6 million in 2013. the change of $75.1 million was primarily due to our refinancing in the second quarter of 2013 and our improved financial performance in 2014. cash interest payments were $28.3 million in 2014 compared to $78.2 million in 2013. the $78.2 million in cash interest payments in 2013 included a $39.5 million prepayment penalty related to the termination of our term loan. in addition, our working capital only increased $7.8 million compared to an increase in working capital of $31.8 million in 2013.
cash used in investing activities increased $1,413.2 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the change is primarily due to the $1,462.7 million probuild acquisition.  in addition, we acquired timber tech for $5.8 million during 2015.  in 2014, $69.3 million of cash was used for acquisitions.  capital expenditures for 2015 were $43.8 million compared to $25.7 million in 2014.  the increase in capital expenditures primarily relates to purchasing machinery, equipment and vehicles to support sales growth and to increase capacity at existing locations.
cash used in investing activities increased $95.4 million in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase is primarily due to $69.3 million in cash used for acquisitions in 2014 and a $10.7 million increase in capital expenditures in 2014 compared to 2013. the remaining change is primarily due to a decrease of $13.0 million in restricted cash related to the transfer of our outstanding letters of credit from the previous facility to our new letter of credit sub-facility, which eliminated our cash collateral requirement for outstanding letters of credit in 2013. the increase in capital expenditures during 2014 primarily relates to the purchase of facilities in greensboro, nc, conroe, tx, and schertz, tx, improvements related to the relocation of two facilities, as well as purchasing machinery and equipment to support sales growth and to increase capacity at existing locations.
cash provided by financing activities was $1,378.3 million and $30.4 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. during 2015 cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to financing activities related to the probuild acquisition, including $700.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of notes, $594.0 million of proceeds from a new term loan agreement, $320.0 million of borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, and $111.3 million of proceeds from the public offering of common stock, net of issuance costs. slightly offsetting this, we repaid $290.0 million under the revolving credit facilities during 2015.  in addition, we paid $58.5 million of deferred loan costs in 2015.
cash provided financing activities for 2014 was $30.4 million compared to cash used in financing activities in 2013 of $29.7 million. cash provided by financing activities for 2014 primarily relates to our $30.0 million borrowing under the 2013 facility. cash used in 2013 primarily relates to our refinancing in the second quarter of 2013. in the second quarter of 2013 we issued $350.0 million of our 2021 notes and repaid our $225.0 million term loan and $139.7 million of our second priority senior secured floating rate notes due 2016 ("2016 notes"). the remaining change is primarily due to $15.6 million in payments of deferred loan costs related to our 2013 facility and 2021 notes.
capital expenditures capital expenditures vary depending on prevailing business factors, including current and anticipated market conditions. historically, capital expenditures have for the most part remained at relatively low levels in comparison to the operating cash flows generated during the corresponding periods. we expect our 2016 capital expenditures to be approximately $90-$100 million primarily related to rolling stock, equipment and facility improvements to support our operations.

(1)   we had $60.0 million in borrowings under the 2015 facility as of december 31, 2015. borrowings under the 2015 facility bear interest at a variable rate. therefore, actual interest may differ from the amounts presented above due to interest rate changes or any future borrowing activity under the 2015 facility. the 2015 term loan also bears interest at a variable rate, therefore actual interest may differ from the amounts presented above due to interest rate changes.

(2)   future minimum commitments for lease finance obligations and capital lease obligations.

(3)   we have $0.2 million of uncertain tax positions recorded in long-term liabilities or as a reduction to operating loss carryforwards. we also have $0.3 million in interest and penalties accrued related to these uncertain tax positions. it is not reasonably possible to predict at this time when (or if) any of these amounts will be settled.

the amounts reflected in the table above for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases with an initial or remaining term in excess of one year at december 31, 2015. purchase orders entered into in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table because they are payable within one year. amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities. we plan to lease additional delivery equipment during 2016 to support anticipated sales growth. these operating leases are not included in the table above.
other cash obligations not reflected in the balance sheet in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, commonly referred to as gaap, our operating leases are not recorded in our balance sheet. in addition to the lease obligations included in the above table, we have residual value guarantees on certain equipment leases. under these leases we have the option of (1) purchasing the equipment at the end of the lease term, (2) arranging for the sale of the equipment to a third party, or (3) returning the equipment to the lessor to sell the equipment. if the sales proceeds in either case are less than the residual value, then we are required to reimburse the lessor for the deficiency up to a specified level as stated in each lease agreement. the guarantees under these leases for the residual values of equipment at the end of the respective operating lease periods approximated $3.2 million as of december 31, 2015.
based upon the expectation that none of these leased assets will have a residual value at the end of the lease term that is materially less than the value specified in the related operating lease agreement or that we will purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term, we do not believe it is probable that we will be required to fund any amounts under the terms of these guarantee arrangements. accordingly, no accruals have been recognized for these guarantees.
in addition, the company is party to certain agreements related to its lease finance obligations which commit the company to perform certain repairs and maintenance obligations under the leases in a specified manner and timeframe that generally will occur throughout the next year.
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that both are important to the accurate portrayal of a company's financial condition and results, and require subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
in order to prepare financial statements that conform to gaap, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. certain estimates are particularly sensitive due to their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may be significantly different from our expectations.
34
we have identified the following accounting policies that require us to make the most subjective or complex judgments in order to fairly present our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
vendor rebates. many of our arrangements with our vendors provide for us to receive a rebate of a specified amount payable to us when we achieve any of a number of measures, generally related to the volume of purchases from our vendors. we account for these rebates as a reduction of the prices of the vendor's products, which reduces inventory until we sell the product, at which time these rebates reduce cost of sales. throughout the year, we estimate the amount of rebates based upon our historical level of purchases. we continually revise these estimates to reflect actual purchase levels.
if market conditions were to change, vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs. although these changes would not affect the amounts which we have recorded related to product already purchased, it may impact our gross margins on products we sell or sales earned in future periods.
allowance for doubtful accounts and related reserves. we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses due to the failure of our customers to make required payments. we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral. however, we have, in some cases, required customers to collateralize their debt with us. consistent with industry practices, we typically require payment from most customers within 30 days. as our business is seasonal in certain regions, our customers' businesses are also seasonal. sales are lowest in the winter months, and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time. throughout the year, we record estimated reserves based upon our historical write-offs of uncollectible accounts, taking into consideration certain factors, such as aging statistics and trends, customer payment history, independent credit reports, and discussions with customers. periodically, we perform a specific analysis of all accounts past due and write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote. we charge these write-offs against our allowance for doubtful accounts. any future decline in the macroeconomic factors that affect the overall housing industry or our specific customers' business could cause us to revise our estimate of expected losses and increase our allowance for doubtful accounts.
impairment of long-lived assets. long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives, are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group. our long-lived assets and liabilities are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. our facility related long-lived assets are grouped at a geographical location level, which is at a level below our operating segments. all of our other long-lived assets are grouped at a geographical region level, which is the equivalent of our operating segments. our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market and operational performance. determining whether impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset group, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, their amount, and the asset group's residual value, if any. in turn, measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value, which is based on the best information available.
we use internal cash flow estimates, quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals, as appropriate, to determine fair value. we derive the required cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate. these cash flow estimates are over the remaining useful lives of the asset groups. forecasted housing starts are used to help estimate future revenue. historical trends are then used to project gross margins and operating expenses based upon various revenue levels. if these projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset group. due to the uncertainties associated with these projections, actual results could differ from projected results, and further impairment of long-lived assets could be recorded. future non-cash impairment of long-lived assets would have the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses in such period, but would not impact our current outstanding debt obligations or compliance with covenants contained in the related debt agreements.
in continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded asset impairment charges on held-for-use assets of $1.4 million related to a customer relationship intangible assets associated with a location closure and recorded $0.7 million related to fair value adjustments on held-for-sale assets during 2015. we recorded no significant asset impairment charges in continuing operations in 2014 or 2013.
goodwill. goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire businesses over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed. at december 31, 2015, our goodwill balance was $739.6 million, representing 25.7% of our total assets.
we test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or at any other time when impairment indicators exist by comparing the estimated implied value of a reporting units' goodwill to its book value. examples of such indicators that could cause
35
us to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests include a significant change in the business climate, unexpected competition or a significant deterioration in market share. we may also consider market capitalization relative to our net assets. our industry experienced a significant and severe downturn that began in mid-2006. as such, we have closely monitored the trends in economic factors and their effects on operating results to determine if an impairment trigger was present that would warrant a reassessment of the recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill prior to the required annual impairment test and performed interim impairment tests when warranted. housing starts are a significant sales driver for us. if there is a significant decline or an expected decline in housing starts, this could adversely affect our expectations for a reporting unit and the value of that reporting unit. we did not have any goodwill impairments in continuing operations in 2015, 2014 or 2013.
the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units. as a result of the reorganization following the probuild acquisition, our reporting units are now aligned with our nine geographic regions which are also determined to be our operating segments. in evaluating goodwill for impairment, the company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. if it is concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then no further testing of the goodwill is required.
however, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a two-step process. the first step is to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to the book value, including goodwill. if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the book value, goodwill is not impaired. if the book value exceeds the fair value, the second step of the process is performed to measure the amount of impairment. in step two, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all other assets and liabilities of that reporting unit based on their respective fair values. the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amount allocated to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. goodwill impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying value over its implied fair value. the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated based upon the projected discounted cash flow expected to be generated from the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow methodology. where available and appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow.
in performing our annual impairment tests at december 31, 2015, we developed a range of fair values for our reporting units using a five-year discounted cash flow methodology. inherent in such fair value determinations are estimates relating to future cash flows, including revenue growth, gross margins, operating expenses and long-term growth rates, and our interpretation of current economic indicators and market conditions and their impact on our strategic plans and operations. due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates, interpretations and assumptions, actual results could differ from projected results, and further impairment of goodwill could be recorded.
significant information and assumptions utilized in estimating future cash flows for our reporting units includes publicly available industry information on projected single-family housing starts and lumber commodity prices which are used to project revenue. projected gross margins and operating expenses reflect current headcount levels and cost structure and are flexed in future years based upon historical trends at various revenue levels. long-term growth was based upon terminal value earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda) multiples of 4.5x for all reporting units to reflect the relevant expected acquisition price. a discount rate of 12.5% was used for all reporting units and is intended to reflect the weighted average cost of capital for a potential market participant and includes all risks of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows. decreasing the long-term growth to an ebitda multiple of 3.5x, or increasing the discount rate by 1.0% to 13.5%, would not have changed the results of our impairment testing.
at december 31, 2015, the fair values of each our reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values. the excess (or "cushion") of the implied fair value of goodwill over the carrying value of goodwill for each of our six reporting units which have remaining goodwill balances ranged from $75.0 million to $300.0 million. factors that could negatively impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units and potentially trigger additional impairment include, but are not limited to, unexpected competition, lower than expected housing starts, an increase in market participant weighted average cost of capital, increases in material or labor cost, and significant declines in our market capitalization. future non-cash impairment of goodwill would have the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses in such period, but would not impact our current outstanding debt obligations or compliance with covenants contained in the related debt agreements.
deferred income taxes. we evaluate our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether a valuation allowance is required. in accordance with the income taxes topic of the accounting standards codification ("codification") we assess whether it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. significant judgment is required in estimating valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. the realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in the applicable carryback or carryforward periods. we consider nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative losses, among other matters, the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities, historical and forecasted taxable income, and tax planning strategies in our assessment. changes in our estimates of future taxable income and tax planning strategies will affect our
36
estimate of the realization of the tax benefits of these tax carryforwards. to the extent we generate sufficient taxable income in the future to fully utilize the tax benefits of the net tax deferred assets on which a valuation allowance was recorded, our effective tax rate may decrease as the valuation allowance is reversed.
poor housing market conditions have contributed to our cumulative loss position for the past several years. while we generated income in 2014, we still have a cumulative unadjusted loss for the three year period ending december 31, 2015. further, taking into consideration the historical probuild results on a proforma basis also results in a cumulative loss for the three year period ending december 31, 2015. we believe the cumulative loss position, as well as uncertainty around the extent and timing of the housing market recovery, represents significant negative evidence in considering whether our deferred tax assets are realizable. further, we do not believe that relying solely on projections of future taxable income to support the recovery of deferred tax assets is sufficient.  based on an evaluation of positive and negative evidence, we concluded that the negative evidence regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets outweighed the positive evidence as of december 31, 2015.
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or increased, or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.  we currently estimate that we will likely transition into a three year cumulative income position, including an evaluation of probuild's historical results, on a rolling three year period at some time during the year ending december 31, 2016. however, there continues to be uncertainty around housing market projections and without continued improvement in housing activity, we may not reverse our cumulative loss position.  simply coming out of a cumulative loss position is not viewed as a bright line and may not be considered sufficient positive evidence to reverse some or all of the valuation allowance if there is other negative evidence. in upcoming quarters, we will closely monitor the positive and negative evidence surrounding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets.
in 2015, we recorded a valuation allowance of $9.7 million related to our continuing operations. in 2014, we reduced our valuation allowance by $7.2 million due to the utilization of net operating losses against federal and state taxable income.  in 2013, we recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $15.3 million related to our continuing operations, which is exclusive of $0.6 million related primarily to reversals of uncertain tax positions due to statute expirations that affected our net operating loss carryforward and valuation allowance.
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates. in certain cases, we also base our estimate on business plan forecasts and other expectations about future outcomes. changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect our actual tax results, and future business results may affect the amount of our deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of our deferred tax assets over time. due to uncertainties in the estimation process, particularly with respect to changes in facts and circumstances in future reporting periods, as well as the residential homebuilding industry's cyclicality and sensitivity to changes in economic conditions, it is possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in previous analyses.
accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.
insurance. we are insured for general liability, auto liability and workers' compensation exposures, subject to deductible amounts. the expected liability for unpaid claims, including incurred but not reported losses, is determined using the assistance of a third-party actuary and is reflected on our balance sheet as an accrued liability. the amount recoverable from our insurance provider is reflected as an other asset. our accounting policy includes an internal evaluation and adjustment of our reserve for all insured losses on a quarterly basis. at least on an annual basis, we engage an external actuarial professional to independently assess and estimate the total liability outstanding, which is compared to the actual reserve balance at that time and adjusted accordingly.
stock-based compensation. calculating stock-based compensation expense requires the input of subjective assumptions. we determine the fair value of each option grant using the black-scholes option-pricing model with assumptions based primarily on historical data. specific inputs to the model include: the expected life of the stock-based awards, stock price volatility, dividend yield and risk-free rate.
the expected life represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding. we have used the simplified method for determining the expected life assumption due to limited historical exercise experience on our stock options. the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period equal to the expected life of the option. the expected dividend yield is based on our history of not paying regular dividends in the past and our current intention to not pay regular dividends in the foreseeable future. the risk-free rate is based on the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant and has a term equal to the expected life of the options. we record expense for the unvested portion of grants over the requisite service (i.e., vesting) periods.

recently issued accounting standards in february 2016, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued an update to the existing guidance under leases topic. under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases, at the commencement date: (1) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. this update requires a modified retrospective transition as of the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. this update is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements.
in november 2015, the fasb issued an update to the existing guidance under the income taxes topic. the amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. the current requirement that deferred tax assets and liabilities of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by these changes. this update is effective for periods beginning after december 15, 2016 with early application permitted. the company elected to adopt this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2015. this update was applied on a prospective basis, as such prior year amounts have not been restated on a retrospective basis.
in september 2015, the fasb issued an update to the existing guidance under the business combinations topic. this update simplifies the accounting for measurement-period adjustments. the amendments in this update require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. this update will be effective for all annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2015. the amendments in this update should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of this update with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. the company elected to adopt this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2015. as such, measurement period adjustments will be recognized in the period in which they are identified.
in july 2015 the fasb issued an update to the existing guidance under the inventory topic of the codification. this update changes the subsequent measurement of inventory from lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016. early adoption of this guidance is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. this guidance requires prospective application. we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on our financial statements.
in april 2015 the fasb issued an update to the existing guidance under the interest topic of the codification. this update requires debt issuance costs to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of a deferred charge. this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2015. this guidance requires retrospective application. early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued.  as described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k the company elected to adopt this guidance in the third quarter of 2015.
in january 2015 the fasb issued an update to the existing guidance under the income statement topic of the codification.  this update eliminates the concept of extraordinary items and the requirement to assess whether an event or transaction is both unusual in nature and infrequent in occurrence and to separately present any such items on the statement of operations after income from continuing operations. under the updated guidance such items will either be presented as a separate component of income from continuing operations or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2015. early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption, but not required. the guidance allows either prospective or retrospective methods of adoption. we do not currently expect that the adoption of this update will have an impact on our financial statements.
in august 2014, the fasb issued an update to the existing guidance under the presentation of financial statements topic of the codification. this update requires management to perform interim and annual assessments on whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and to provide related disclosures, if required. this new guidance is effective for the annual period ending after december 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter. early adoption is permitted, but not required. we are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements.
in may 2014, the fasb issued an update to the existing guidance under the revenue recognition topic of the codification which is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model requiring a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  this new guidance was originally effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016.
38
however, in july 2015 the fasb approved an optional one year deferral of the effective date to annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017.  as such, this guidance will be effective for us beginning on january 1, 2018. early adoption is permitted; however, this guidance cannot be adopted earlier than the original effective date. this guidance allows either full retrospective or modified retrospective methods of adoption. we are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements.

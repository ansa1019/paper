item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
about stryker stryker corporation is a global leader in medical technology with 2015 revenues of $9,946 and net earnings of $1,439. we offer a diverse array of innovative medical technologies, including reconstructive, medical and surgical, and neurotechnology and spine products to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives.
in the united states most of our products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other healthcare facilities. we generally maintain separate dedicated sales forces for each of our principal product lines to provide focus and a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served. our products are sold in approximately 100 countries through company-owned sales subsidiaries and branches as well as third-party dealers and distributors. our business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is typically lower during the summer months and sales of capital equipment are generally higher in the fourth quarter.
making healthcare better is at the heart of what we do. we do this by collaborating with our customers to develop innovative products and services that ultimately improve patients' lives. we express this through our mission statement:
"together with our customers, we are driven to make healthcare better."
we believe our success in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate depends on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products. we are committed to internal innovation to develop products and services that improve outcomes and deliver greater cost savings and efficiencies and to augment our efforts with focused acquisitions. our success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day.
our goal is to achieve sales growth at the high-end of the medical technology industry (medtech) industry and maintain our capital allocation strategy that prioritizes:
1.   acquisitions
2.   dividends
3.   share repurchases overview of 2015
in 2015 we achieved sales growth of 2.8% in line with our ongoing goal to grow organic sales at the high-end of medtech. excluding the impact of acquisitions, sales grew 6.1% in constant currency. we reported net earnings per diluted share of $3.78 in 2015 and achieved an 8.2% growth in adjusted net earnings per diluted share (see page 12 for a reconciliation of reported net earnings per diluted share to adjusted net earnings per diluted share). we continued our capital allocation strategy by investing $153 in acquisitions, paying $521 in dividends to our shareholders and using $700 for share repurchases.
in 2015 we acquired chg hospital beds, inc. ("chg"). chg designs, manufactures and markets low-height hospital beds and related accessories.
recent developments on january 26, 2016 we announced that william r. jellison has elected to retire from his role as vice president, chief financial officer effective april 1, 2016. glenn s. boehnlein, who currently serves as group vice president, chief financial officer for medsurg & neurotechnology, has been promoted to vice president, chief financial officer effective april 1, 2016.
on february 1, 2016 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire sage products, llc (sage) in an all cash transaction for $2,775. sage develops, manufactures and distributes disposable products targeted at reducing "never events," primarily in the intensive care unit and medsurg hospital unit setting. sage's products include solutions for oral care, skin preparation and protection, patient cleaning and hygiene, turning and positioning devices and heel care boots. this transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 2016.

stryker corporation 2015 form 10-k non-gaap financial measures we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (gaap) with certain non-gaap financial measures, including percentage sales growth in constant currency; percentage organic sales growth; adjusted gross profit; cost of sales excluding specified items; adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses; adjusted amortization of intangible assets; adjusted operating income; adjusted effective income tax rate; adjusted net earnings; and adjusted net earnings per diluted share (diluted eps). we believe that these non-gaap measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. management uses these non-gaap financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-gaap financial measures.
to measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates. to measure percentage organic sales growth, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions that affect the comparability and trend of sales. percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions.
to measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. these adjustments are irregular in timing, may not be indicative of our past and future performance and are therefore excluded to allow investors to better understand underlying operating trends. the following are examples of the types of adjustments that may be included in a period:
1.   acquisition and integration related costs. costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses and specific costs related to the consummation of the acquisition process.
2.   amortization of intangible assets. periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets.
3.   restructuring-related charges. costs associated with workforce reductions, facility rationalizations and other restructuring activities.
4.   recall matters. our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve certain product recalls.
5.   regulatory and legal matters. our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve certain regulatory matters and other legal settlements.
6.   tax matters. certain significant and discrete tax items and adjustments to interest expense related to the settlement of certain tax matters.
because non-gaap financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-gaap financial measures having the same or similar names. these adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, gross profit, cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, amortization of intangible assets, operating income, effective income tax rate, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable gaap financial measures. these non-gaap financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our gaap results and the reconciliations to corresponding gaap financial measures below provide a more complete understanding of our business. we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
the following reconciles the non-gaap financial measures: adjusted gross profit; adjusted selling, general and administrative expense; adjusted operating income; adjusted other income (expense), net; adjusted net earnings; adjusted effective tax rate; and adjusted diluted eps; with the most directly comparable gaap financial measures:

we believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates.
operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. excess operating cash is used first to fund acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses. other discretionary uses include dividends and share repurchases. as necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. our overall cash position shows our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.
operating activities cash provided by operations was $899, $1,782, $1,886 in 2015, 2014 and 2013. the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to recall-related payments associated with the rejuvenate and abgii recall settlement agreement and the timing of income tax payments.
the net of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable resulted in the consumption of $231, $249, and $165 of cash in 2015, 2014 and 2013. inventory days on hand for 2015 increased by 5 days from 2014 after increasing eight days in 2014. accounts receivable days sales outstanding for 2015 increased by one day after decreasing one day in 2014.
investing activities cash provided by investing activities was $1,956 in 2015 compared to cash used in investing of $1,878 in 2014 and $2,217 in 2013. this change is primarily due to the sale of a portion of our marketable securities in 2015 to make recall-related payments discussed above under operating activities.
acquisitions: acquisitions resulted in cash consumption of $153, $916 and $2,320 in 2015, 2014 and 2013. in 2015 the primary acquisition was chg, and in 2014 the primary acquisitions were patient safety technologies, inc., pivot medical inc., berchtold holding, ag and small bone innovations, inc. in 2013 we acquired trauson holdings company limited and mako surgical corp.
capital expenditures: capital expenditures were $270, $233 and $195 in 2015, 2014 and 2013. capital expenditures in 2015 were primarily related to acquisition integration support, information technology infrastructure upgrades, capacity expansion, new product introductions, innovation and cost savings.
financing activities dividends paid: dividends paid per common share increased 9.8% to $1.34 per share in 2015 compared to $1.22 per share in 2014, an increase of 15.1% from 2013. dividends paid per common share and total dividends paid to common shareholders are included in the following table for 2015, 2014 and 2013.
2015                                                               2014          2013

total dividends paid to common shareholders      $521          $462          $401
short-term and long-term debt: we maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and overall cost of capital.

stryker corporation 2015 form 10-k net proceeds from borrowings were $48, $1,159 and $1,005 in 2015, 2014 and 2013. in 2015 the proceeds were primarily from the public offerings of notes offset by the payment of certain notes due and paid in january 2015. proceeds in 2014 were primarily from the public offerings of notes and commercial paper. refer to note 9 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information. total debt was $4,022 and $3,973 in 2015 and 2014.
share repurchases: the total use of cash for share repurchases was $700, $100 and $317 in 2015, 2014 and 2013. we have decided to suspend our share repurchase program through 2016.
liquidity cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $4,079 and $5,000 on december 31, 2015 and 2014 and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by $4,441 and $4,223 on december 31, 2015 and 2014. we anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs, including recall-related payments related to the rejuvenate and abg ii recalls, from a variety of sources, including cash from operations, commercial paper and existing credit lines. we have raised funds in the capital markets and may continue to do so from time to time. we have strong short-term and long-term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due. we have existing credit facilities should additional funds be required. on december 31, 2015 we had approximately $1,236 of borrowing capacity available under our existing credit facilities.
on december 31, 2015 approximately 46% of our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held in locations outside the united states. in 2014 we announced that we would begin a repatriation program. we completed the program in 2015 and repatriated approximately $1.8 billion to the united states. our remaining cash held outside the united states is considered to be indefinitely reinvested. we intend to use this cash to expand operations, either organically or through acquisitions outside the united states.
we continually evaluate our receivables, particularly in spain, portugal, italy and greece (the southern european region). the total net receivables from the southern european region were approximately $132 and $154 in 2015 and 2014, including approximately $51 and $78 of sovereign receivables in 2015 and 2014. we believe that our current reserves related to receivables are adequate and any additional credit risk associated with the southern european region is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial position or liquidity. we currently do not have any investments in the sovereign debt instruments of the southern european region.  any non-sovereign exposure in these countries is considered immaterial.
in 2015 we made recall-related payments of $1,202 under our united states rejuvenate and abg ii settlement agreement. refer to note 8 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
guarantees and other off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.
contractual obligations and forward-looking cash requirements as further described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2015 we recorded additional charges to earnings totaling $295 related to the rejuvenate and abg ii recalls. based on the information that has been received, the actuarially determined range of probable loss to resolve this matter is estimated to be approximately $1,824 ($2,056 before $232 of third-party insurance recoveries) to $2,416. the final outcome of this matter is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict. the ultimate cost to entirely resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made.
as further described in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, on december 31, 2015 we have recorded a liability for uncertain income tax positions of $313. due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which any income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made.
as further described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, on december 31, 2015 our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $240, of which approximately $231 related to plans outside the united states. due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and potential changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions, we are not able to reasonably estimate beyond 2016 the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans.

critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. these include inventory reserves, income taxes, acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets, and legal and other contingencies. we believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition.
inventory reserves we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. we make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. if actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.

stryker corporation 2015 form 10-k income taxes our annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.
deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment.
inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.
we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. in certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. these differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. we have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events, such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.
acquisitions, goodwill and intangibles, and long-lived assets we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting. under the purchase method, our financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. in addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded on the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill.
significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant items. the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain. we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. with the exception of certain trade names, the majority of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer and distributor relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, trademark and/or brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarks or brands are sold. our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors. determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life.
in certain of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (iprd) intangible assets. iprd is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset until such time as the research is completed (at which time it becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset) or determined to have no future use (at which time it is impaired).
the value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment. our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles. we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year. we consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill. in certain circumstances, we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. in those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. we test individual indefinite-lived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value. we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach. under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.
we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill during the years presented, as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values exceeded their respective recorded values. future changes in the judgments, assumptions

stryker corporation 2015 form 10-k and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates and future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements.
we review our other long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level. the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections. if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. assets classified as held for sale, if any, are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
legal and other contingencies we are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. the outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time. in certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief. for legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded. the estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies. if actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. we are currently self-insured for product liability-related claims and expenses. the ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

other information hedging and derivative financial instruments we sell our products globally, as a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the united states dollar; european currencies, in particular the euro, swiss franc and the british pound; the japanese yen; the australian dollar; and the canadian dollar. we develop and manufacture products in the united states, canada, turkey, china, france, germany, ireland, puerto rico and switzerland and incur costs in the applicable local currencies. this global deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales.
we enter into designated and non-designated forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. these nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products. the periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. all forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains (losses) for non-designated forward contracts and any ineffectiveness measured on designated forward currency exchange contracts included in our consolidated statements of earnings. for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
we have designated certain long-term intercompany loans payable and forward exchange contracts as net investment hedges of our investments in certain international subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency. the effective portion of derivatives designated as net investment hedges are recorded at fair value at each balance sheet date and the change in fair value is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.
the estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points. a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar would change the december 31, 2015 fair value by approximately $178. we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on our outstanding forward currency exchange contracts, but we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties.
we have certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged. these investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. for 2015 the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar decreased the value of these investments in net assets and increased the related foreign currency translation adjustment loss in shareholders' equity by ($390). refer to note 3 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

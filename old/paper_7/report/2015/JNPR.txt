item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes in item 8 of part ii of this report.
the following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or u.s. gaap. in the course of operating our business, we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices, the collection of receivables, the manufacturing and shipment of products, the fulfillment of orders, the purchase of supplies, and the building of inventory and spare parts, among other matters. each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period. in making these decisions, we consider various factors including contractual obligations, customer satisfaction, competition, internal and external financial targets and expectations, and financial planning objectives. for further information about our critical accounting policies and estimates, see "critical accounting policies and estimates" section included in this "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
to aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this report, we have provided an executive overview and a summary of the business and market environment. these sections should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in this item 7, our "risk factors" section included in item 1a of part i, and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item 8 of part ii of this report.
business and market environment at juniper networks, we design, develop, and sell products and services for high-performance networks to enable customers to build highly scalable, reliable, secure and cost-effective networks for their businesses, while achieving agility, efficiency and value through automation. we focus on customers and partners across our key market verticals who view these network attributes as fundamental to their business; including telecom, cable providers, cloud providers, national government, financial services, and enterprise strategic verticals. we believe that product and solution differentiation, with a relentless customer focus, will enable us to achieve our goal of growing our revenue faster than the market.
our products are sold in three geographic regions: americas; europe, middle east, and africa, or emea; and asia pacific, or apac. our high-performance routing, switching, and security networking products and service offerings are sold to service provider and enterprise markets. we believe that our silicon, systems, and software represent innovations that transform the economics and experience of networking, helping our customers achieve superior performance, greater choice, and flexibility, while reducing overall total cost of ownership. in addition to our products, we offer technical support and professional services, as well as education and training programs to our customers. together, our high-performance product and service offerings help our customers convert legacy networks that provide commoditized services into more valuable assets that provide differentiation, value, and increased performance, reliability, and security to end-users.
our fiscal 2015 results showed improvement, with year-over-year net revenue increases across all verticals and geographies, and solid growth in our routing, switching and high-end srx platforms and security software products. as anticipated, in the second half of 2015, u.s. telecom, showed an improvement in net revenues compared to the first half of 2015, as well as the second half of 2014. of our top ten customers for fiscal 2015, five were telecom customers, three of which were outside of the u.s., and five were cloud and cable providers. we expect the overall revenue environment to be challenging in the near-term, as market dynamics may impact demand from some of our customers. we also anticipate the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar to other currencies to remain strong. further, we believe our product gross margins may continue to vary in the future due to competitive pricing pressures, which may be offset by additional operational efficiencies.
nevertheless, we are focused on executing our strategy, which is focused on designing, developing and selling products and services for high-performance networks. we believe our product portfolio continues to be strong, and we remain focused on operational excellence, cost discipline, targeted growth initiatives, as well as partnerships and tuck-in acquisitions that complement our r&d strategy. for example, in january 2016, we announced our intent to acquire optical equipment provider bti systems, which we believe will allow us to accelerate the delivery of open and automated packet optical transport solutions with integrated network management based on bti systems' pronx service manager and our connectivity services director, as well as northstar controller. we believe that, together, these products provide a unified management interface for multi-layer provisioning of end-to-end services across ip and optical networks.
further, our intent is to lead in the area of software solutions that simplify the operation of networks, and to allow our customers across our key verticals to deliver real value over those networks. we anticipate that our increased focus on software business models will result in an increase in software revenue as a percentage of total revenue over time.

in 2015, we continued to invest in innovation and strengthening our product portfolio, which resulted in new product offerings across routing, switching, and security. in routing, we expanded our acx series portfolio with the addition of acx500 and acx5000 routers, enabling service providers to handle added capacity and accelerate service orchestration; announced new line cards for the ptx3000 and ptx5000; expanded our converged supercore architecture with the addition of the ptx1000, a compact 3tbps fixed configuration core router; enhanced the mx series 3d universal edge routing portfolio with new line cards and software features that triple throughput and enable network automation; and introduced the nfx series, the first in a planned series of network services platforms that can operate as secure, on-premises devices running multiple virtual network functions, or vfns, - from us and third parties - simultaneously, thereby significantly reducing costs and giving service providers the ability to update network functions without having to purchase new hardware. additionally, we announced cloud cpe, a fully automated, end-to-end network functions virtualization, or nfv, solution, that builds on the proven ability of juniper networks contrail networking to scale across all nfv deployment models.
in switching, we announced qfx10000 high performance data center switches, which are powered by our new q5 chip, a purpose-built asic that we believe enables unprecedented performance, port density, and scale, as well as the new junos fusion for data centers to provide industry-leading network scale and automation capabilities for small to internet-scale cloud networks. we also announced a disaggregated version of our junos software to provide customers with ultimate choice in data center deployment options. in addition, we announced the qfx5200 line of access switches, the first platform to run the disaggregated junos software as well as support the emerging 25 and 50 gigabit ethernet, or gbe, standard. additionally, we highlighted the rapid implementation of metafabric architecture and contrail sdn technologies across leading converged and hyper-converged stack solutions.
also, juniper networks unite was announced, a new campus architecture that provides simplified and secure network infrastructure solutions required to modernize enterprise campus and branch networks into cloud-enabled service platforms. additionally, we announced junos fusion enterprise, a new open architecture, based on the 802.1br industry standard, that when combined with ex series ethernet switches, we believe will enable the configuration and management of the entire distributed enterprise network as a single network entity.
furthermore, we unveiled the qfx5100-aa switch and the qfx-pfa, a new packet flow accelerator module. collectively, this solution provides a data center switch that consolidates compute resources and customizable logic into the network. for the enterprise, we partnered with ruckus wireless to provide high-performance, scalable and open network solutions for both wired and wireless products. additionally, we announced a new technology alliance with aerohive to deliver simple, secure and cloud-managed wired and wireless solutions to enterprises.
for security, we announced advanced malware protection with zero-day threat protection from the cloud, redesigned security management, and the latest firewalls for enterprise campus and branch networks, as part of our new juniper networks unite architecture. our latest security solutions include juniper networks sky advanced threat prevention, junos space security director, juniper networks srx300 series services gateways and srx1500, which are designed to provide customers with the sophisticated threat protection, security management, automation and scale needed to defend against threats at any point in the network without hindering network performance.
we also introduced new hardware and software for juniper networks srx5800 services gateway. the improvements will increase available internet mix, or imix, firewall throughput up to two terabits per second, or 2 tbps. additionally, an optimization capability called express path was introduced to the juniper network srx5000 series services gateways, delivering powerful performance enhancements, to boost throughput and reduce latency. we also announced new application security capabilities with appsecure 2.0 for our virtual firewall, vsrx, to deliver enhanced protection for cloud and hybrid data centers.
in addition to our new product announcements, we continued to deliver on our previously announced capital return program. for fiscal year 2015, we repurchased $1,142.5 million of shares of our common stock and paid four quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share for an aggregate amount of $156.3 million. since the first quarter of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $3.6 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016. given that we have almost completed our $4.1 billion dollar capital return commitment, going forward, we intend to target a capital return policy of approximately 50% of annual free cash flow, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends. free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.
in 2015, we issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.30% senior notes due 2020, or 2020 notes, and $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.35% senior notes due 2025, or 2025 notes, and intend to refinance, subject to market and other business conditions, $300 million of our previously issued debt maturing in march 2016.

________________________________
(*)   dso and book-to-bill are for the fourth quarter ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013.
•   net revenues: during 2015, net revenues increased, compared to 2014, as a result of increases across all verticals and geographies, primarily due to an increase in service providers net revenues across all three geographies, as well as an increase in enterprise net revenues in the americas. the year-over-year increase in net revenues was also a result of a strong increase in net revenues from our routing products, partially offset by a decrease in net revenues from screen os products and divestiture of pulse secure products in the third quarter of 2014.
during 2014, net revenues were slightly down, compared to 2013, as a result of a decline in net revenues from u.s. carriers, partially offset by growing demand from cloud providers in the americas, as well as improving demand among service provider in emea. the year-over-year decline in our net revenues was primarily due to a decrease in net revenues from our routing and security products, partially offset by an increase in our switching products revenue and service revenue.
•   gross margin: our gross margin as a percentage of net revenues increased during 2015, compared to 2014, as a result of higher restructuring and other (benefit) charges recorded in 2014 but not in 2015, in connection with the restructuring plan we initiated in the first quarter of 2014, or the 2014 restructuring plan, as well as a steady increase in net revenues compared to 2014.
our gross margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased during 2014, compared to 2013, as a result of higher inventory charges driven by product rationalizations in connection with our 2014 restructuring plan and charges related to an industry-wide memory product quality defect for a component from a third party supplier.
41
•   operating income (loss): during 2015, compared to 2014, we experienced an increase in operating income (loss) as percentage of net revenues, as a result of higher net revenues and effective management of our cost structure. additionally, operating loss in 2014 included $850.0 million goodwill impairment charge and restructuring charges of $207.7 million in connection with our 2014 restructuring plan.
during 2014, compared to 2013, we experienced a decline in operating income (loss) as a percentage of net revenues, primarily due to an $850.0 million goodwill impairment charge related to the security reporting unit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014, restructuring and other charges of $207.7 million, related to severance, facility consolidations and closures, asset write-offs, and contract terminations in connection with our 2014 restructuring plan, as well as a component remediation charge of $20.7 million relating to the memory product quality defect.
•   cash dividends declared per common stock: during 2015, we declared four quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share, payable on march 24, 2015, june 23, 2015, september 22, 2015, and on december 22, 2015, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on march 3, 2015, june 2, 2015, september 1, 2015 and on december 1, 2015, respectively, in the aggregate amount of $156.3 million.
during 2014, we declared two quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share, payable on september 23, 2014 and on december 23, 2014 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on september 2, 2014 and december 2, 2014, respectively, in the aggregate amount of $86.0 million. we had not previously paid cash dividends.
•   stock repurchase plan activity: under our stock repurchase program, we repurchased approximately 45.4 million shares of our common stock in the open market at an average price of $25.16 per share for an aggregate purchase of $1,142.5 million during 2015.
during 2014, we repurchased approximately 96.1 million shares of our common stock in the open market at an average price of $23.41 per share for an aggregate purchase of $2,250.0 million.
•   operating cash flows: cash flow from operations increased by $129.1 million in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to higher revenue and improved operating margin.
operating cash flows decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to lower cash collections from customers, higher payments primarily related to our 2014 restructuring plans, higher taxes paid, and lower prepayments compared to prior year.
•   dso: dso is calculated as the ratio of ending accounts receivable, net of allowances, divided by average daily net sales for the preceding 90 days. dso for the quarter ended december 31, 2015 increased by 4 days, or 8% compared to the quarter ended december 31, 2014. the increase in dso was primarily due to a significant increase of service billings invoiced late in the fourth quarter.
dso for the quarter ended december 31, 2014 increased by 8 days, or 20% compared to the quarter ended december 31, 2013. during 2014, we transitioned certain distribution partners from a third party financing program to juniper's commercial payment terms. going forward, we expect dso to be in the range of 45 to 55 days.
•   book-to-bill: book-to-bill represents the ratio of product orders booked divided by product revenues during the respective period. book-to-bill was greater than one for the quarters ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, indicating strong product demand.
•   deferred revenue: total deferred revenue increased by $92.4 million to $1,168.1 million as of december 31, 2015, compared to $1,075.7 million as of december 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase in deferred service revenue of $77.7 million, driven by timing of service contract renewals as well as higher product deferrals as a result of an increase in channel inventory and subscription deferrals.
as of december 31, 2014 compared to december 31, 2013, total deferred revenue increased by $6.4 million, primarily due to an increase in deferred service revenue of $25.8 million, primarily driven by the execution of several multi-year support agreements and annual agreement renewals. the increase in deferred service revenue was partially offset by a decrease in deferred product revenue of $19.4 million as a result of lower distributor inventory and multiple revenue releases in relation to previously deferred product revenue.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. gaap requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to sales returns, pricing credits, warranty costs, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long-term assets, especially goodwill and intangible assets, contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges, assumptions used in the valuation of share-based compensation, and litigation. we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. for further information about our significant accounting policies, see note 2, significant accounting policies, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report, which describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future consolidated results of operations may be affected.
•   goodwill. we make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. these estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected customer retention rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customer and product base, and the expected use of the acquired assets. these factors are also considered in determining the useful life of the acquired intangible assets. the amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense.
goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination or an acquisition that are not individually identified and separately recorded. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets of businesses acquired in a business combination is recognized as goodwill. we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, as of november 1st, or more frequently if an event occurs or facts and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amount.
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segment level, by comparing the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. the reporting units are determined based on the components of our operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly review the operating results of the component.
the provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangibles allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. various factors are considered in the qualitative assessment, including macroeconomic conditions, financial performance, or a sustained decrease in share price. if as a result of the qualitative assessment, it is deemed more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, management will perform the quantitative test.
the quantitative goodwill impairment test, if necessary, involves a two-step process to identify goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized, if any. the first step tests for potential impairment by comparing the fair value of reporting units with the reporting unit's net asset values. if the fair value of the reporting units exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit's net assets, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. if the fair value of the reporting units does not exceed the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit, then we perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. the second step requires an assignment of the reporting unit's fair value to the reporting unit's assets and liabilities, using the relevant acquisition accounting guidance, to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill, and if the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference.
in the first step, the fair value of each of our reporting units is determined using both the income and market valuation approaches. we believe the income approach and the market approach are equally representative of the reporting unit's fair value. under the income approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated
43
future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life. under the market approach, the value of the reporting unit is based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting unit to values of publicly-traded companies in similar lines of business. in the application of the income and market valuation approaches, we are required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables. determining the fair value of a reporting unit is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. actual future results related to assumed variables could differ from these estimates. in addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units.
under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. cash flow projections are based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. the discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the business's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, and then apply a control premium which is determined by considering control premiums offered as part of the acquisitions that have occurred in market segments that are comparable with our reporting units. the income approach and the market approach are equally weighted to derive the fair value of the reporting unit.
prior to the second step, the long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment. recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset, or asset group, to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, or asset group. if needed, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset, or asset group, exceeds its fair value.
in the second step, the reporting unit's fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets; such as, existing technology, backlog, and customer relationships, in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. if the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. assumptions used in measuring the fair value of these assets and liabilities included the discount rates, customer renewal rates, and technology obsolescence rates used in valuing intangible assets, and pricing of comparable transactions in the market in valuing the tangible assets.
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we elected to perform the qualitative assessment for all of our reporting units. this qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the fair values of our reporting units were below carrying value. we considered macroeconomic factors including the economic growth, general macroeconomic trends and growth for the markets in which the reporting units operate, changes in the industry environment, and the performance of market competitors. in addition to these macroeconomic factors, among other things, we considered the reporting units' current results and forecasts, any changes in the nature of the business, any changes in cost factors, any significant legal, regulatory, contractual, or other business factors, and changes in the carrying amount of net assets.
as a result of our qualitative assessment, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that our goodwill was not impaired and we did not need to perform a quantitative assessment.

•   inventory valuation and contract manufacturer liabilities. inventory consists primarily of component parts to be used in the manufacturing process and is stated at lower of average cost or market. a provision is recorded when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete, to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value. in determining the provision, we also consider estimated recovery rates based on the nature of the inventory. as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, our net inventory balances were $75.0 million and $62.5 million, respectively.
we establish a liability for non-cancelable, non-returnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or obsolete materials charges for components purchased by the contract manufacturers based on our demand forecasts or customer orders. we also take estimated recoveries of aged inventory

into consideration when determining the liability. as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, our contract manufacturer liabilities were $18.0 million and $25.3 million, respectively.
significant judgment is used in establishing our forecasts of future demand, recovery rates based on the nature and age of inventory, and obsolete material exposures. we perform a detailed analysis and review of data used in establishing our demand forecasts. if the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast, which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and our customer requirements, we may be required to increase our inventory write-downs and contract manufacturer liabilities, which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities. inventory and supply chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order to reduce lead times.
•   revenue recognition. revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred, (3) sales price is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. we enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and while some of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. as a result, significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and, if so, how the price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. changes in the allocation of the sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition but will not change the total revenue recognized on the contract.
under our revenue recognition policies, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy. the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor-specific objective evidence, or vsoe, if available, third-party evidence, or tpe, if vsoe is not available, or estimated selling price, or esp, if neither vsoe nor tpe is available. we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately. tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in stand-alone sales to similarly situated customers. we do not use tpe as we do not consider our products to be similar or interchangeable to our competitors' products in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. esp is established considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and product life cycle. consideration is also given to market conditions such as industry pricing strategies and technology life cycles. when determining esp, we apply management judgment to establish margin objectives and pricing strategies and to evaluate market conditions and product life cycles. revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual support period, which is generally one to three years.
•   income taxes. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our taxes. although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by expiration of or lapses in the r&d tax credit laws; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany r&d cost-sharing arrangement and legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, including possible u.s. changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules. in addition, the oecd's recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, if adopted by countries, will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. significant judgment
45
is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
•   loss contingencies. we use significant judgment and assumptions to estimate the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, in determining loss contingencies. an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. we record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 2, significant accounting policies, in notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on financial condition and results of operations, which is incorporated herein by reference.
results of operations we sell our high-performance networking products and service offerings across routing, switching, and security to two primary markets: service provider and enterprise. our determination of the market to which a particular revenue transaction relates to is based primarily upon the customer's industrial classification code, but may also include subjective factors such as the intended use of the product. the service provider market generally includes wireline and wireless carriers, and cable operators, as well as major internet content and application providers, including those that provide social networking and search engine services. the enterprise market generally is comprised of businesses; federal, state, and local governments; research and education institutions; and financial services.

2015 compared to 2014
routing product net revenues increased in 2015, compared to 2014, as a result of an increase from cloud providers, cable, and telecom in emea and apac. during 2015, we saw a strong increase in demand from both service provider and enterprise markets for our routing products, as well as an overall increase in net revenues from our mx960, mx2020, and ptx series products.
switching product net revenues increased in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to data center build-outs with telecom and cloud providers. this result was enabled by the significant growth with the qfx product family. additionally, we saw solid
46
strength in switching net revenues in the americas and apac, which was slightly offset by a decrease in emea. we also saw a year-over-year increase in the service provider market for our switching products.
security product net revenues decreased in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to the divestiture of our junos pulse product lines and a continuing decline in our screenos products, which was partially offset by an increase in sales of our srx platform and security software year-over-year. additionally, we also saw a decrease in security net revenues within the enterprise market, which was partially offset by a slight increase in the service provider market.
the increase in service net revenues in 2015, compared to 2014, was primarily driven by new service contracts and strong contract renewals. service revenues are largely correlated with product revenues, therefore if product net revenues decline, it can have an impact on future service revenues.
2014 compared to 2013
routing product net revenues decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, as a result of weaker demand for core routing products, partially offset by strong growth of our ptx series products. edge routing net revenues increased as a result of strong demand for our mx series products, partly offset by older edge routing platforms. the year-over year decline was driven by weakness from large u.s. carriers, partially offset by strength from cloud providers.
switching product net revenues increased in 2014, compared to 2013, reflecting growth from both our qfabric system and our ex series products. during 2014 we saw strong adoption of qfabric data center switches by a growing number of customers, with especially strong demand from cloud providers in the americas.
security product net revenues decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to a continuing decline in our legacy screenos products and the divestiture of our junos pulse product lines. sales of our srx platform declined slightly year-over-year, due to lower demand from u.s. carrier customers.
the increase in service revenue in 2014, compared to 2013, was primarily driven by new service contracts and strong contract renewals.

2015 compared to 2014
net revenues in the americas increased in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to a strong increase in net revenues from both the service provider and enterprise markets. the increase in both the service provider and enterprise markets within the americas was due to an increase in net revenues across routing, switching, and srx product net revenues, as well as service net revenues. in addition, we saw a strong increase in net revenues from cloud providers, cable, and enterprise, partially offset by telecom.

net revenues in emea increased in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in net revenues from telecom and cloud providers slightly offset by a decrease in the enterprise market.
net revenues in apac increased in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in net revenues from telecom and cloud providers. we experienced a significant decline in china, which was partially offset by an increase in net revenues in japan and australia.
2014 compared to 2013
net revenues in the americas increased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to an increase in net revenues from service provider markets, partially offset by a decline in the enterprise market. the increase in net revenues in the service provider market was due to strong demand from cloud providers and cable, partially offset by a decrease in demand from carriers. the decline in the enterprise market resulted from a decline in net revenues due to recognition of revenue from a large u.s. federal government contract in 2013.
net revenues in emea slightly increased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to stronger demand from service providers partially offset by a decrease in net revenues from the enterprise market, although demand from the public sector remained strong.
net revenues in apac decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to a decline in net revenues from both the service provider and enterprise market.

2015 compared to 2014
net revenues from the service provider market increased in 2015, compared to 2014, with growth from cloud providers, telecom in emea and apac, and cable. within the service provider market, we saw strength across routing, switching, and security, with the largest increase in net revenues from routing revenue.
net revenues from the enterprise market increased in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to strength in service and routing, and to a lesser extent, switching, which was partially offset by a slight decrease in revenue from our security products. net revenues in the americas from the enterprise market increased across routing, switching, and srx security.
2014 compared to 2013
net revenues from the service provider market increased in 2014, compared to 2013, with growth in the americas and emea. the increase in service provider net revenues in the americas was driven by increased revenues from cloud providers and cable, partially offset by decreased revenues from large carriers. the increase in service provider net revenues in emea was attributable to growth with large carriers, while in apac net revenues in the service provider market declined as a result of lower demand with both small and large carriers. in addition, service provider demand for switching products continued to be strong.
net revenues from the enterprise market decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to a decline in sales in all geographic regions, however, revenue demand from public sector customers was higher for all three regions.

our gross margins have been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the mix and average selling prices of our products and services, new product introductions and enhancements, manufacturing costs, expenses for inventory obsolescence and warranty obligations, cost of support and service personnel, and the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold.
2015 compared to 2014
product gross margin increased as a percentage of product net revenues in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to a decrease in product cost of revenues. the decrease in cost of revenues is attributable to the non-recurrence of restructuring charges recorded in 2014 for asset write-downs. no such charges were incurred in 2015. excluding these components from prior year cost of sales, year-over-year gross margin would remain relatively consistent.
service gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues increased in 2015, compared to 2014. services delivery costs increased at a slower rate than service revenue as a result of better labor efficiency and improved product quality.
2014 compared to 2013
product gross margin decreased as a percentage of product net revenues in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to an increase in cost of revenues. the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to asset write-downs of $41.5 million for product rationalizations in connection with our 2014 restructuring plan and $20.7 million in connection with an industry-wide memory product quality defect in a component from a third-party supplier. excluding the costs of the restructuring and component defect, product gross margin as a percentage of net revenues improved slightly primarily due to the favorability in product mix in the 2014 period.
service gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues decreased slightly in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to an increase in labor and logistics delivery costs to support new contracts and product introductions.

our operating expenses have historically been driven in large part by personnel-related costs, including wages, commissions, bonuses, benefits, share-based compensation, and travel, particularly with respect to r&d and sales and marketing activities. facility and information technology, or it, departmental costs are allocated to each department based on usage and headcount. facility and it related headcount was 412, 366, and 396, as of december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. we had a total of 9,058, 8,806, and 9,483, employees as of december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
2015 compared to 2014
research and development research and development expense decreased in 2015, compared to 2014, as a result of lower headcount. headcount declined from an average of 3,888 in 2014 to 3,724 in 2015, leading to a reduction in payroll costs and stock based compensation. in addition, outside consulting services decreased due to reduced consulting expenses, which was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense on r&d equipment and bonus expense.
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense decreased in 2015, compared to 2014. average headcount increased from 2,360 in 2014 to 2,446 in 2015, however the mix of employees hired in 2015 was significantly different to 2014 which resulted in lower salary and bonus expense. additionally, commissions expense decreased compared to 2014 as a result of the elimination of certain commission programs and a reduction in sales staff.
general and administrative general and administrative expense decreased in 2015, compared to 2014 primarily as a result of higher litigation and investigation related costs incurred in 2014, in connection with the investigations into possible violations of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, and to a lesser extent, our patent litigation case with palo alto networks. additionally, we saw a decrease in general and administrative consulting fees, which was slightly offset by a higher bad debt expense amount.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges decreased in 2015, compared to 2014, due to higher charges recorded in 2014 in connection with our 2014 restructuring plan. during 2014, we implemented the 2014 restructuring plan and incurred restructuring charges of $166.2 million related to workforce reductions, contract terminations, project cancellations, and facility closures. the 2014 restructuring plan has been substantially completed as of december 31, 2014.

during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded $0.4 million of severance costs and a benefit of $1.0 million for facilities that were recorded in restructuring and other (benefits) charges in the consolidated statements of operations, in connection with the 2014 restructuring plan. see note 9, restructuring and other charges, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion of our restructuring activities.
impairment of goodwill in 2014, we determined that the security reporting unit's carrying value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of $850.0 million which was recorded in the consolidated statement of operations, no such charges were recorded in 2015.
2014 compared to 2013
research and development research and development expense decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to lower personnel-related expenses as a result of restructuring actions and divestiture of our junos pulse product lines. r&d headcount decreased 8% from 4,135 as of december 31, 2013 to 3,797 as of december 31, 2014. the decrease in r&d personnel expense was partially offset by higher share-based compensation expense as a result of our acquisition of wandl, inc. in the first quarter of 2014, and engineering program costs in 2014, compared to 2013.
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to lower personnel-related expenses and other discretionary expenses due to our cost reduction efforts and creating efficiency in our sales activities. the decrease in personnel-related expenses was primarily due to headcount reductions. sales and marketing headcount decreased 11% from 2,626 as of december 31, 2013 to 2,348 as of december 31, 2014.
general and administrative general and administrative expense increased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to higher litigation and investigation related costs incurred in the current period in connection with investigation into possible violations of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and, to a lesser extent, our patent litigation case with palo alto networks, as well as other litigation matters. this increase was partially offset by personnel-related expenses as a result of headcount reductions of 8% from 513 as of december 31, 2013 to 470 as of december 31, 2014. our patent litigation with palo alto networks was settled in 2014.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges increased in 2014, compared to 2013, due to higher charges recorded in 2014 in connection with our 2014 restructuring plan. during 2014, we implemented the 2014 restructuring plan and incurred restructuring charges of $166.2 million related to workforce reductions, contract terminations, project cancellations, and facility closures. the 2014 restructuring plan has been substantially completed as of december 31, 2014 and we do not expect to record significant future charges. see note 9, restructuring and other charges, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report, for further discussion of our restructuring activities.
impairment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2014, we began to implement a new security strategy focused on network resiliency and performance based on the srx platform. as a result, we rationalized our security product portfolio including developing a new product roadmap and exiting certain point products, including the divestiture of junos pulse. these factors decreased our short term and near term revenue and profitability forecasts of the security reporting unit. during our fiscal year 2014 annual goodwill impairment test, the carrying value of our security reporting unit's goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of $850.0 million which was recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in part ii item 8 of this report. see note 7, goodwill and purchased intangibles, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion on the impairment of goodwill.

2015 compared to 2014
share-based compensation expense decreased in 2015, compared to 2014. the decrease in expense was primarily related to a decline in actual shares vested.
2014 compared to 2013
share-based compensation expense remained consistent in 2014, compared to 2013. an increase in expense related to rsus, rsas, and psas assumed in connection with our acquisition of wandl in 2014 and an increase in grant date fair values due to higher stock prices was offset by a decrease in actual shares vested.

2015 compared to 2014
interest income interest income increased in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a higher balance of longer term investments yielding higher interest as well as a full year of interest income on the pulse note receivable.
interest expense interest expense increased in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to the issuance of our 2020 and 2025 notes in the first quarter of 2015. see note 10, debt and financing, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 in part ii of this report for additional information regarding our 2020 and 2025 notes.
gain on legal settlement during the year ended december 31, 2015, no litigation-related gains were recorded, while in 2014, we entered into a settlement agreement with palo alto networks resolving patent litigation between the two companies, which resulted in a realized gain on legal settlement and subsequent sale of related securities of $196.1 million, net of legal fees.
gain on investments during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded a gain of $7.3 million, primarily related to the sale of privately held investments. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded a gain of $163.0 million primarily related to the sale of investments which were converted from privately-held investments to publicly-traded equity upon initial public offering, or ipo, and subsequently sold.
2014 compared to 2013
interest income interest income increased in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to a higher balance of longer term investments yielding higher interest.
interest expense interest expense increased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to the issuance of our 2024 notes in the first quarter of 2014. see note 10, debt and financing, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 in part ii of this report for additional information regarding our 2024 notes.
gain on legal settlement during the year ended december 31, 2014, we entered into a settlement agreement with palo alto networks resolving patent litigation between the two companies, which resulted in a realized gain on legal settlement and subsequent sale of related securities of $196.1 million, net of legal fees.
gain on investments during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded a gain of $163.0 million, primarily related to the sale of investments which were converted from privately-held investments to publicly-traded equity upon ipo and subsequently sold. during the year ended december 31, 2013, net gain on investments was primarily comprised of a gain of $7.1 million related to the company's privately-held investments and publicly traded-equity investments.
gain on sale of junos pulse the sale of our junos pulse product portfolio was completed on october 1, 2014 and we recorded a gain of $19.6 million in other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statement of operations. this sale was driven by product rationalization in connection with our initiative to focus on projects with the highest potential for growth. see note 8, other financial information, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion on the sale junos pulse.
53
income tax provision the effective rate for 2015 was lower than the federal statutory rate of 35%, primarily due to the benefit of the federal r&d tax credit; a change in the tax treatment of share-based compensation in the cost sharing arrangement, which resulted from a u.s. tax court opinion as discussed in note 14, income taxes; recognition of domestic production activities deductions; and earnings in foreign jurisdictions, which are subject to lower tax rates. the passage of protecting americans from tax hike act of 2015 on december 18, 2015 retroactively and permanently reinstated the u.s. federal r&d tax credit effective january 1, 2015.
the effective rate for 2014 differs from the federal statutory rate of 35%, primarily due to the impact of the non-deductible goodwill charge and tax gain on sale of junos pulse offset by the benefit from release of the company's valuation allowance attributable to investment losses; the federal r&d tax credit; recognition of domestic production activities deductions; and earnings in foreign jurisdictions, which are subject to lower tax rates. the passage of tax increase prevention act of 2014 on december 19, 2014 retroactively reinstated the u.s. federal r&d tax credit from january 1, 2014 to december 31, 2014.
our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. our effective tax rate could also fluctuate due to changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items. see item 1a of part ii, risk factors of this report for a description of relevant risks which may adversely affect our results.
for a complete reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% and further explanation of our income tax provision, see note 14, income taxes, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report.

the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable, reduced by short-term debt, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and short-term deferred revenue. working capital decreased by $186.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily due to reclassification of long-term debt to short-term debt, as well as dividend payments, capital expenditures, and interest paid on debt, partially offset by the issuance of the 2020 notes and the 2025 notes in march 2015.
54
summary of cash flows as of december 31, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $218.7 million from december 31, 2014 primarily due to higher capital expenditures, dividend payout, and higher interest paid on debt, which was partially offset by the issuance of our 2020 and 2025 notes.
the following table summarizes cash flows from our consolidated statements of cash flows (in millions, except percentages):

operating activities
2015 compared to 2014
net cash provided by operating activities was $892.5 million in 2015, compared to $763.4 million in 2014. the increase of $129.1 million is primarily due to higher revenue and improved operating margin.
2014 compared to 2013
cash flow from operations was $763.4 million in 2014, compared to $845.9 million in 2013. the decrease of $82.5 million is primarily due to lower cash collections from customers, higher payments related to our restructuring plans, higher taxes paid, and lower prepayments compared to prior year.
investing activities
2015 compared to 2014
net cash used in investing was $508.7 million in 2015, compared to net cash provided by investing of $434.0 million in 2014. the decrease of $942.7 million in cash flows from investing activities was primarily due to lower proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities in 2015, compared to 2014. in 2014, the sale of available-for-sale securities were higher in order to partially fund our accelerated share repurchase program. we also received higher proceeds from the sale of certain publicly traded equity securities and proceeds from the sale of junos pulse in 2014, which was partially offset by higher cash payments to purchase available-for-sale investments.
2014 compared to 2013
net cash provided by investing was $434.0 million in 2014, compared to net cash used in investing of $561.0 million in 2013. the increase in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to higher proceeds from sale of investments and fewer purchases of investments, as well as proceeds received from the sale of junos pulse.
financing activities
2015 compared to 2014
net cash used in financing activities was $581.4 million in 2015, compared to $1,824.2 million in 2014. the decrease of $1,242.8 million was due to lower purchases and retirement of our common stock during fiscal 2015.
55
2014 compared to 2013
net cash used in financing activities was $1,824.2 million in 2014, compared to $401.7 million in 2013. the increase of $1,422.5 million is primarily due to higher purchases and retirement of our common stock and payment of cash dividends, partially offset by the issuance of the 2024 notes.
stock repurchase activities in february 2014, our board of directors, which we refer to as the board, approved a stock repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to $2.1 billion of our common stock, including $1.2 billion pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase program, or the 2014 stock repurchase program. in october 2014 and july 2015, the board authorized a $1.3 billion and $500.0 million increase, respectively, to the 2014 stock repurchase program for a total of $3.9 billion. as of december 31, 2015, there was $532.5 million of authorized funds remaining under the 2014 stock repurchase program.

_______________________________
(1)   as part of the 2014 stock repurchase program, we entered into two separate accelerated share repurchase agreements, or collectively, the asr, with two financial institutions to repurchase $1.2 billion of our common stock. we made an up-front payment of $1.2 billion pursuant to the asr to repurchase our common stock. the aggregate number of shares ultimately purchased was determined based on a volume weighted average repurchase price, less an agreed upon discount. the shares received with respect to the asr have been retired. retired shares return to authorized but unissued shares of common stock.
future stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program will be subject to a review of the circumstances at that time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. see note 18, subsequent events, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 part ii of this report for discussion of our stock repurchase activity subsequent to december 31, 2015.
dividends during 2015, we declared four quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share of common stock on january 27, 2015, april 23, 2015, july 23, 2015 and on october 22, 2015, which were paid on march 24, 2015, june 23, 2015, september 22, 2015 and on december 22, 2015, respectively, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on march 3, 2015, june 2, 2015, september 1, 2015, and december 1, 2015, respectively, in the aggregate amount of $156.3 million.
during 2014, we declared two quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share of common stock, or $86.0 million, on july 22, 2014 and october 23, 2014, which were paid on september 23, 2014 and december 23, 2014, respectively, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on september 2, 2014 and december 2, 2014, respectively. any future dividends, and the establishment of record and payment dates, are subject to approval by our board or an authorized committee thereof. see note 18, subsequent events, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion on our dividend declaration subsequent to december 31, 2015.
56
restructuring as of december 31, 2015, our restructuring liability was $2.8 million related to facility closures expected to be paid through march 2018. see note 9, restructuring and other charges, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion on our restructuring plans.
deferred revenue deferred product revenue represents unrecognized revenue related to shipments to distributors that have not sold through to end-users, undelivered product commitments, and other shipments that have not met all revenue recognition criteria. deferred product revenue is recorded net of the related costs of product revenue. deferred service revenue represents customer payments made in advance for services, which include technical support, hardware and software maintenance, professional services, and training.
the following table summarizes our deferred product and service revenues (in millions):
as of december 31,
2015                                                                                              2014

as of december 31, 2015, net deferred product revenue increased $14.7 million to $240.3 million, compared to $225.6 million as of december 31, 2014, primarily as a result of an increase in channel inventory and subscription deferrals. as of december 31, 2015, the increase in deferred service revenue of $77.7 million was primarily driven by timing of service contract renewals.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. it is not our business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. however, in the normal course of business, we enter into contracts consisting of guarantees of product and service performance, guarantees related to third-party customer-financing arrangements, customs and duties guarantees, and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities. see guarantees below and note 16, commitments and contingencies, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for additional information regarding our guarantees.

contractual obligations our principal commitments consist of obligations outstanding under operating leases, purchase commitments, debt, and other contractual obligations. the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of december 31, 2015 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in millions):

(2) see note 10, debt and financing, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for additional information regarding our debt.
(3)the future minimum lease payment is related to the data center lease agreement that we entered in to on july 10, 2015. see note 16, commitments and contingencies, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further explanation on the data lease agreement.
as of december 31, 2015, we had $187.3 million included in long-term income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets for unrecognized tax positions. at this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to this amount due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. as a result, this amount is not included in the table above.
revolving credit facility on june 27, 2014, we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a five year $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, with an option to increase the amount of the credit facility by up to an additional $200.0 million, subject to certain conditions. proceeds from borrowing made under the credit agreement may be used by us for working capital and general corporate purposes. revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until june 27, 2019, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid.
the credit agreement requires us to maintain a leverage ratio no greater than 3.0x and an interest coverage ratio no less than 3.0x during the term of the credit facility. in addition, the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, change their accounting or reporting policies, change their business and incur subsidiary indebtedness, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type. as of december 31, 2015, the company was in compliance with all covenants in the credit agreement, and no amounts were outstanding. see note 10, debt and financing, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report.
guarantees we have entered into agreements with customers that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that our products solely, or in combination with other third party products, infringe the intellectual property rights of a third-party. as of december 31, 2015, we recorded a $15.0 million liability for such indemnification obligations in other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. we also have financial guarantees consisting of guarantees of product and service performance, guarantees related to third-party customer-financing arrangements, custom and duty guarantees, and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities. under certain third-party customer financing arrangements that contain guarantee provisions, which have terms of up to four years, we are liable for the aggregate unpaid payments to the third-party financing company in the event of customer default. as of december 31, 2015, we have not made any payments under these arrangements. as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, we had $15.8 million and $26.2 million, respectively, in financing guarantees,
58
bank guarantees, and standby letters of credit related to these financial guarantees of which $9.9 million in financing guarantees was recorded in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2015.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions and investments in strategic relationships that we have made or we may make in the future. additionally, in 2014, we indicated that we intend to return $4.1 billion to our stockholders in the form of stock repurchases and dividends from february 2014 through the end of 2016. to the extent we repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program or pay cash dividends on our common stock, our liquidity may be impacted. as of december 31, 2015, 94% of our cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances were held outside of the u.s., which may be subject to u.s. taxes if repatriated.
in august 2013, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec enabling us to offer for sale, from time to time, an unspecified amount of securities in one or more offerings and is intended to give us flexibility to take advantage of financing opportunities as needed or deemed desirable in light of market conditions. our 2020 notes and 2025 notes were issued pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the sec on february 26, 2015 to the automatic shelf registration statement and our 2024 notes were issued under the automatic shelf registration statement pursuant to a prospectus filed with the sec on february 28, 2014. any other offerings of securities under the automatic shelf registration statement will be made pursuant to a prospectus. in addition, our revolving credit facility will also provide additional flexibility for future liquidity needs.
we have been focused on managing our annual equity usage as a percentage of the common stock outstanding to align with peer group competitive levels and have made changes in recent years to reduce the number of shares underlying the equity awards we grant. for fiscal year 2015, we intended to target the number of shares underlying equity awards granted on an annual basis at 2.50% or less of our common stock outstanding on a pure share basis (where each option, rsu, rsa or psa granted is counted as one share). based upon shares underlying our grants to date of options, rsus, rsas, and psas, we met this target for 2015.
based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term, and long-term investments, together with cash generated from operations and access to capital markets and the revolving credit facility under the credit agreement will be sufficient to fund our operations, planned stock repurchases and dividends, and anticipated growth for at least the next twelve months. we believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures, commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations during the same period. however, our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors, including, but not limited to:
•   level and mix of our product, sales, and gross profit margins;
•   our business, product, capital expenditures and r&amp;d plans;
•   repurchases of our common stock;
•   payment of dividends;
•   incurrence and repayment of debt and related interest obligations;
•   litigation expenses, settlements, and judgments, or similar items related to resolution of tax audits;
•   volume price discounts and customer rebates;
•   accounts receivable levels that we maintain;
•   acquisitions and/or funding of other businesses, assets, products, or technologies;
•   changes in our compensation policies;
•   capital improvements for new and existing facilities;
•   technological advances;
59
•   our competitors' responses to our products and/or pricing;
•   our relationships with suppliers, partners, and customers;
•   possible future investments in raw material and finished goods inventories;
•   expenses related to future restructuring plans;
•   tax expense associated with share-based awards;
•   issuance of share-based awards and the related payment in cash for withholding taxes in the current year and possibly during future years;
•   level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases under our equity incentive plans; and
•   general economic conditions and specific conditions in our industry and markets, including the effects of disruptions in global credit and financial markets, international conflicts, and related uncertainties.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global distributor of vehicle products, including replacement parts, components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles, as well as specialty vehicle products and accessories.
buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources: new products produced by original equipment manufacturers ("oems"); new products produced by companies other than the oems, which are sometimes referred to as aftermarket products; recycled products obtained from salvage vehicles; used products that have been refurbished; and used products that have been remanufactured. we distribute a variety of products to collision and mechanical repair shops, including aftermarket collision and mechanical products, recycled collision and mechanical products, refurbished collision products such as wheels, bumper covers and lights, and remanufactured engines. collectively, we refer to these products as alternative parts because they are not new oem products.
we are the nation's largest provider of alternative vehicle collision replacement products and a leading provider of alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products, with our sales, processing, and distribution facilities reaching most major markets in the united states and canada. we are also a leading provider of alternative vehicle replacement and maintenance products in the united kingdom and the benelux region (belgium, netherlands, & luxembourg) of continental europe. in addition to our wholesale operations, we operate heavy duty truck facilities and self service retail facilities across the u.s. that sell recycled automotive products from end-of-life-vehicles. in 2014, we expanded our product offering to include specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories through the acquisition of keystone specialty.
we are organized into four operating segments: wholesale - north america; europe; specialty; and self service. we aggregate our north american operating segments (wholesale - north america and self service) into one reportable segment, resulting in three reportable segments: north america, europe and specialty.
our revenue, cost of goods sold, and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. factors that may affect our operating results include, but are not limited to, those listed in the special note on forward-looking statements in part i, item 1 and risk factors in part i, item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k. accordingly, our historical results of operations may not be indicative of future performance.
acquisitions and investments since our inception in 1998, we have pursued a growth strategy through both organic growth and acquisitions. we have pursued acquisitions that we believe will help drive profitability, cash flow and stockholder value. our principal focus for acquisitions is companies that are market leaders, will expand our geographic presence and enhance our ability to provide a wide array of automotive products to our customers through our distribution network.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we completed 18 acquisitions, including 4 wholesale businesses in north america and 12 wholesale businesses in europe, a self service retail operation, and a specialty vehicle aftermarket business. our wholesale business acquisitions in north america included partschannel, inc. ("parts channel"), an aftermarket collision parts distributor. the specialty aftermarket business acquired was the coast distribution system, inc. ("coast"), a supplier of replacement parts, supplies and accessories for the recreational vehicle ("rv") and outdoor recreation markets. our european acquisitions included 11 aftermarket parts distribution businesses in the netherlands, 9 of which were former customers of and distributors for our netherlands subsidiary, sator, and were acquired with the objective of expanding our distribution network in the netherlands. our other acquisitions completed in 2015 enabled us to expand our geographic presence.
on december 22, 2015, lkq and its wholly-owned subsidiary lkq italia s.r.l. entered into an agreement to acquire the holding company of rhiag-inter auto parts italia s.p.a ("rhiag"), a distributor of aftermarket spare parts for passenger cars and commercial vehicles in italy, czech republic, switzerland, hungary, romania, ukraine, bulgaria, slovakia, poland and spain. the transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2016 and is subject to customary closing conditions and necessary regulatory approvals. this acquisition will expand lkq's geographic presence in continental europe. we believe the acquisition will create potential purchasing synergies.
on january 3, 2014, we completed our acquisition of keystone specialty. keystone specialty is a leading distributor and marketer of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories in north america serving the following six product segments: truck and off-road; speed and performance; recreational vehicle; towing; wheels, tires and performance handling; and miscellaneous accessories. our acquisition of keystone specialty allowed us to enter into new product lines and increase the size of our addressable market. in addition, we believe that the acquisition creates logistics and administrative cost synergies and potential cross-selling opportunities.
35
in addition to our acquisition of keystone specialty, we made 22 acquisitions during 2014, including 9 wholesale businesses in north america, 9 wholesale businesses in europe, 2 self service retail operations, and 2 specialty vehicle aftermarket businesses. our european acquisitions included seven aftermarket parts distribution businesses in the netherlands, five of which were customers of and distributors for our netherlands subsidiary, sator. our acquisitions in the netherlands enabled us to transform the existing distribution model to better align with that of our u.k. operations. this realignment has allowed us to sell directly to the end repair shop customer versus through a local wholesale distributor, and to improve margins, customer service, and fulfillment rates, and positioned us well to introduce additional product categories in the long term. our other acquisitions completed during the year ended december 31, 2014 enabled us to expand into new product lines and enter new markets.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, we completed 20 acquisitions, including our may 2013 acquisition of sator, a vehicle mechanical aftermarket parts distribution company based in the netherlands, with operations in the netherlands, belgium and northern france. with the acquisition of sator, we expanded our geographic presence in the european vehicle mechanical aftermarket products market into continental europe to complement our existing u.k. operations. in addition to our acquisition of sator, we acquired 10 wholesale businesses in north america, 7 wholesale businesses in europe and 2 self service operations. our european acquisitions included five automotive paint distribution businesses in the u.k., which enabled us to expand our collision product offerings. the other acquisitions completed during 2013 enabled us to expand into new product lines and enter new markets.
in august 2013, we entered into an agreement with suncorp group, a leading general insurance group in australia and new zealand, to develop an alternative vehicle replacement parts business, acm parts pty ltd ("acm parts"), in those countries. as of december 31, 2015, this investment was classified as held for sale and included within other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. the sale of this investment was completed in february 2016. refer to note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies" within the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information related to this investment.
sources of revenue we report our revenue in two categories: (i) parts and services and (ii) other. our parts and services revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle products and related services including (i) aftermarket, other new and refurbished products and (ii) recycled, remanufactured and related products and services. our service revenue is generated primarily from the sale of extended warranties, fees for admission to our self service yards, and processing fees related to the secure disposal of vehicles. for the year ended december 31, 2015, parts and services revenue represented approximately 93% of our consolidated revenue.
the majority of our parts and services revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle replacement products to collision and mechanical repair shops. in north america, our vehicle replacement products include sheet metal crash parts such as doors, hoods, and fenders; bumper covers; mirrors and grills; head and tail lamps; wheels; and large mechanical items such as engines and transmissions. in europe, our products include a wide variety of small mechanical products such as filters, belts and hoses, spark plugs, alternators and water pumps, batteries, suspension and brake parts, clutches, and oil and lubricants. the demand for these products is influenced by several factors, including the number of vehicles in operation, the number of miles being driven, the frequency and severity of vehicle accidents, the age profile of vehicles in accidents, seasonal weather patterns and local weather conditions and the availability and pricing of new oem parts. with respect to collision related products, automobile insurers exert significant influence over collision repair shops as to how an insured vehicle is repaired and the cost level of the products used in the repair process. accordingly, we consider automobile insurers to be key demand drivers of our vehicle replacement products. while they are not our direct customers, we do provide insurance carriers services in an effort to promote the increased usage of alternative replacement products in the repair process. such services include the review of vehicle repair order estimates, direct quotation services to insurance company adjusters and an aftermarket parts quality and service assurance program. we neither charge a fee to the insurance carriers for these services nor adjust our pricing of products for our customers when we perform these services for insurance carriers. there is no standard price for many of our vehicle replacement products, but rather a pricing structure that varies from day to day based upon such factors as product availability, quality, demand, new oem product prices, the age and mileage of the vehicle from which the part was obtained, competitor pricing and our product cost.
our revenue from aftermarket, other new and refurbished products also includes revenue generated from the sale of specialty aftermarket vehicle equipment and accessories. these products are primarily sold to a large customer base of specialty vehicle retailers and equipment installers, including mostly independent, single-site operators. specialty vehicle aftermarket products are typically installed on vehicles within the first year of ownership to enhance functionality, performance or aesthetics. as a result, the demand for these products is influenced by new and used vehicle sales and the overall economic health of vehicle owners, which may be affected by general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels
36
and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. the prices for our specialty vehicle products are based on manufacturers' suggested retail prices, with discounts applied based on prevailing market conditions, customer volumes and promotions that we may offer from time to time.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, revenue from other sources represented approximately 7% of our consolidated sales. these other sources include scrap sales and sales of aluminum ingots and sows. we derive scrap metal from several sources, including vehicles that have been used in both our wholesale and self service recycling operations and from oems and other entities that contract with us for secure disposal of "crush only" vehicles. other revenue will vary from period to period based on fluctuations in commodity prices and the volume of materials sold.
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold for aftermarket products includes the price we pay for the parts, freight, and overhead costs related to the purchasing, warehousing and distribution of our inventory, including labor, facility and equipment costs and depreciation. our aftermarket products are acquired from a number of vendors. our cost of goods sold for refurbished products includes the price we pay for cores, freight, and costs to refurbish the parts, including direct and indirect labor, facility and equipment costs, depreciation and other overhead related to our refurbishing operations.
our cost of goods sold for recycled products includes the price we pay for the salvage vehicle and, where applicable, auction, towing and storage fees. prices for salvage vehicles may be impacted by a variety of factors, including the number of buyers competing to purchase the vehicles, the demand and pricing trends for used vehicles, the number of vehicles designated as "total losses" by insurance companies, the production level of new vehicles (which provides the source from which salvage vehicles ultimately come), the age of vehicles at auction and the status of laws regulating bidders or exporters of salvage vehicles. from time to time, we may also adjust our buying strategy to target vehicles with different attributes (for example, age, level of damage, and revenue potential). due to changes relating to these factors, we have seen the prices we pay for salvage vehicles fluctuate over time. our cost of goods sold also includes labor and other costs we incur to acquire and dismantle such vehicles. our labor and labor-related costs related to acquisition and dismantling generally account for between 9% and 11% of our cost of goods sold for vehicles we dismantle. the acquisition and dismantling of salvage vehicles is a manual process and, as a result, energy costs are not material. our cost of goods sold for remanufactured products includes the price we pay for cores; freight; and costs to remanufacture the products, including direct and indirect labor, facility and equipment costs, depreciation and other overhead related to our remanufacturing operations.
some of our salvage mechanical products are sold with a standard six-month warranty against defects. additionally, some of our remanufactured engines are sold with a standard three-year warranty against defects. we also provide a limited lifetime warranty for certain of our aftermarket products that is supported by certain of the suppliers of those products. we record the estimated warranty costs at the time of sale using historical warranty claims information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses.
other revenue is primarily generated from the hulks and unusable parts of the vehicles we acquire for our wholesale and self service recycled product operations, and therefore, the costs of these sales include the proportionate share of the price we pay for the salvage vehicles as well as the applicable auction, storage and towing fees and internal costs to purchase and dismantle the vehicles. our cost of goods sold for other revenue will fluctuate based on the prices paid for salvage vehicles, which may be impacted by a variety of factors as discussed above.
expenses our facility and warehouse expenses primarily include our costs to operate our aftermarket warehouses, salvage yards and self service retail facilities. these costs include personnel expenses such as wages, incentive compensation and employee benefits for plant management and facility and warehouse personnel, as well as rent for our facilities and related utilities, property taxes, repairs and maintenance. the costs included in facility and warehouse expenses do not relate to inventory processing or conversion activities and, as such, are classified below the gross margin line on our consolidated statements of income.
our distribution expenses primarily include our costs to prepare and deliver our products to our customers. included in our distribution expense category are personnel costs such as wages, employee benefits and incentive compensation for drivers; third party freight costs; fuel; and expenses related to our delivery and transfer trucks, including vehicle leases, repairs and maintenance and insurance.
our selling and marketing expenses primarily include salary, commission and other incentive compensation expenses for sales personnel; advertising, promotion and marketing costs; credit card fees; telephone and other communication expenses; and bad debt expense. personnel costs generally account for between 75% and 80% of our selling and marketing expenses. most of our sales personnel are paid on a commission basis. the number and quality of our sales force is critical to our ability
37
to respond to our customers' needs and increase our sales volume. our objective is to continually evaluate our sales force, develop and implement training programs, and utilize appropriate measurements to assess our selling effectiveness.
our general and administrative expenses primarily include the costs of our corporate offices and field support center, which provide management, treasury, accounting, legal, payroll, business development, human resources and information systems functions. general and administrative expenses include wages, benefits, stock-based compensation and other incentive compensation for corporate, regional and administrative personnel; information systems support and maintenance expenses; and accounting, legal and other professional fees.
seasonality our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors, influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns. during the winter months, we tend to have higher demand for our vehicle replacement products because there are more weather related accidents, which generate repairs. we expect our specialty vehicle operations to generate greater revenue and earnings in the first half of the year, when vehicle owners tend to install specialty products.
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, assumptions, and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, business combinations, and goodwill impairment. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and our recognition of revenue. actual results may differ from these estimates.
revenue recognition we recognize and report revenue from the sale of vehicle products when they are shipped to or picked up by the customers and title has transferred, subject to an allowance for estimated returns, discounts and allowances that management estimates based upon historical information. in instances where a product is returned by a customer, the product would ordinarily be returned within a few days of shipment. our customers may earn discounts based upon sales volumes or sales volumes coupled with prompt payment. allowances are normally given within a few days following product shipment. we analyze historical returns and allowances activity by comparing the items to the original invoice amounts and dates. we use this information to project future returns and allowances on products sold. if actual returns and allowances are higher than our historical experience, there would be an adverse impact on our operating results in the period of occurrence.
we recognize revenue from the sale of scrap metal, other metals, and cores when title has transferred, which typically occurs upon delivery to the customer.
inventory accounting salvage and remanufactured inventory. our salvage inventory cost is established based upon the price we pay for a vehicle, including auction, towing and storage fees, as well as expenditures for buying and dismantling vehicles. inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to sales percentage at each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the facility's inventory at expected selling prices, the assessment of which incorporates the sales probability based on a part's days in stock and historical demand. the average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facility's historical profitability for salvage vehicles. remanufactured inventory cost is based upon the price paid for cores, and also includes expenses incurred for freight, direct manufacturing costs and overhead related to our remanufacturing operations.
for all inventory, carrying value is recorded at the lower of cost or market and is reduced to reflect current anticipated demand. if actual demand differs from our estimates, additional reductions to inventory carrying value would be necessary in the period such determination is made.
business combinations we record our acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting, under which the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values. we utilize management estimates and, in some instances, independent third-party valuation firms to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and contingent consideration granted. such estimates and valuations require us to make significant assumptions, including projections of future events and operating performance.
38
goodwill impairment we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at least annually. when testing goodwill for impairment, we are required to evaluate events and circumstances that may affect the performance of the reporting unit and the extent to which the events and circumstances may impact the future cash flows of the reporting unit to determine whether the fair value of the assets exceed the carrying value. if these assumptions or estimates change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets. in response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill.
we are organized into four operating segments: wholesale-north america; europe; specialty; and self service. we have also concluded that these four operating segments are reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing in 2015. we perform goodwill impairment tests annually in the fourth quarter and between annual tests whenever events indicate that an impairment may exist.
our goodwill would be considered impaired if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. the fair value estimates are established using weightings of the results of a discounted cash flow methodology and a comparative market multiples approach. we believe that using two methods to determine fair value limits the chances of an unrepresentative valuation.
during the quarter ended september 30, 2015, we noted that our north american operating margins continued to be negatively affected by the decline in scrap steel and other metals prices, which began in the fourth quarter of 2014. our self service reporting unit has been most impacted by the change in scrap steel prices as the sale of crushed car bodies comprises a relatively large percentage of its sales. it is anticipated that scrap steel prices will continue to have a negative impact on operating margins during 2016. given the decrease in scrap steel prices throughout 2015 and projected softness in 2016 and the corresponding negative effect on our current and expected results, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test for the self service reporting unit as of august 31, 2015. based on the step one analysis performed for the self service reporting unit, no impairment adjustment was required. our forecasts assume scrap steel prices will continue at their current depressed level through all of 2016 before returning to our seven year historical average price of approximately $200 per ton in 2018. based on this forecast, the impairment test indicated the fair value of the self service reporting unit, determined using both market and income approaches, exceeded the reporting unit's carrying value by approximately 11%. declines in expected future cash flows (which are driven by scrap steel and other metals prices), reduction in terminal value growth rates, or an increase to the risk-adjusted discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the self service reporting unit may result in the determination that an impairment adjustment is required.
as of december 31, 2015, we had a total of $2.3 billion in goodwill subject to future impairment tests with approximately $259.0 million allocated to our self service reporting unit. we determined that no adjustments were necessary when we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2015 on all four reporting units. a 10% decrease in the fair value estimates of the reporting units in the annual impairment test would not have changed this determination, but the excess over carrying value for our self service reporting unit was 11% in the most recent test. if we were required to recognize goodwill impairments, we would report those impairment losses as part of our operating results.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
the change in parts and services revenue of 10.3% represents increases of 6.8% in north america, 8% in europe, and 30.6% in specialty. the decline in other revenue of 26.7% primarily reflects the decline in the price of scrap steel and other metals. refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to revenue changes during 2015 compared to the prior year.
cost of goods sold. our cost of goods sold decreased to 60.6% of revenue for the year ended december 31, 2015 from 60.7% of revenue in the prior year. the decrease is related to (i) a decline of 0.3% in costs of goods sold in our european operations, as a result of a 0.2% decrease in our u.k. operations due to lower product costs and 0.1% due to internalizing gross margin from our may 2014 acquisitions of seven netherlands distributors, and (ii) improved net pricing to customers in our north american operations; as our purchase costs were flat on average, the increase in revenue from favorable pricing resulted in a decrease of 0.2% in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue. these decreases were offset by (i) an increase of 0.2% in our specialty operations due to higher inventory costs and unfavorable net customer pricing, and (ii) a negative mix effect of 0.3% primarily resulting from growth of our specialty segment from our october 2014 acquisition of a supplier of parts for recreational vehicles, as this business yields lower gross margins than our north american and european segments. refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the change in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue by segment for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the prior year.
facility and warehouse expenses. as a percentage of revenue, facility and warehouse expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015 decreased to 7.7% from 7.8% in the prior year. compared to the prior year, we experienced a negative impact on operating leverage due to a decrease in other revenue, primarily as a result of declining prices of scrap steel and other metals. excluding the impact of the decline in scrap and other metal prices of 0.1%, facility and warehouse expenses would have improved by 0.2% primarily reflecting a positive mix effect as a greater proportion of revenue was generated from our specialty segment. compared to our north american operations, specialty stores a greater portion of inventory at their regional
40
distribution centers, the costs of which are capitalized into inventory and expensed through cost of goods sold. in our north american wholesale operations, most of the inventory sold by our local operations is stored on site rather than in distribution centers, and the related facility and warehouse expenses of the local operations are recorded in this line item.
distribution expenses. as a percentage of revenue, distribution expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015 decreased to 8.4% from 8.6% in the prior year. distribution expenses decreased by 0.4% compared to the prior year due to fuel cost savings driven by lower average prices. the decline in other revenue caused a 0.2% loss in operating leverage due to the revenue mix shift (scrap and other metals revenue has lower distribution costs than parts sales).
selling, general and administrative expenses. as a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015 increased to 11.5% from 11.3% in the prior year. compared to the prior year, other revenue decreased as a result of declining prices of scrap steel and other metals, which negatively impacted our operating leverage and increased our selling, general and administrative expenses as percentage of revenue by 0.2%. excluding this impact, our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were flat over the prior year.

(1)   restructuring expenses of $10.5 million, $2.0 million, and $0.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 were primarily related to the integration of acquired businesses in our specialty, north america, and europe segments, respectively. these integration activities included the closure of duplicate facilities and termination of employees in connection with the integration of recent acquisitions into our existing business.
(2)   restructuring expense for the year ended december 31, 2014 included $5.8 million of expense related to the integration of our keystone specialty acquisition, as well as $1.9 million, $1.0 million, and $0.8 million of expense related to the integration of acquired businesses in our european, north american and specialty segments, respectively. additionally, we incurred $1.6 million of severance costs to terminated employees as part of the ongoing rationalization of our european operations.
(3)   acquisition related expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015 included $1.6 million for our acquisitions of eleven aftermarket parts distribution businesses in the netherlands and $0.2 million for other european acquisitions, $3.6 million for potential and pending acquisitions, and $1.0 million related to our north america and specialty acquisitions during the year.
(4)   acquisition related expenses for the prior year ended december 31, 2014 include external costs primarily related to our acquisitions of seven distribution companies in the netherlands.

depreciation and amortization. the following table provides additional information about the increase in depreciation and amortization compared to the prior year (in thousands):
year ended december 31,
2015                                                     2014                                 change depreciation                              $88,335                 $86,216                $2,119        (1)
amortization                               33,785                  34,503                  (718    )   (2)
total depreciation and amortization      $122,120                $120,719                $1,401
(1)   the increase in depreciation expense was a result of increased levels of property and equipment to support our acquisition and organic related growth, partially offset by a decline of $3.1 million attributable to the impact of foreign exchange rates.
(2)   the decrease in amortization expense reflects a $1.6 million decline due to foreign exchange rates partially offset by net increases in amortization expense for intangibles recorded related to our 2014 and 2015 acquisitions. the
41
amortization expense for the year ended december 31, 2014 included accelerated amortization for intangibles recognized during 2014 for the january 2014 acquisition of keystone specialty.
other expense, net. the following table summarizes the components of the year-over-year increase in other expense, net (in thousands):
other expense, net for the year ended december 31, 2014             $61,980
increase (decrease) due to:
interest expense                                                     (6,682   )   (1)
loss on debt extinguishment                                            (324   )   (2)
changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities         2,305       (3)
interest and other income, net                                       (1,682   )   (4)
total decrease                                                       (6,383   )
other expense, net for the year ended december 31, 2015             $55,597
(1)   approximately $4.2 million of the reduction in interest expense from the prior year is due to lower outstanding borrowings. the remaining $2.5 million is attributable to lower interest rates under our senior secured credit agreement. the higher outstanding debt levels in the prior year were primarily related to borrowings used to finance the keystone specialty acquisition in january 2014 and cash flow from operations in 2015 that was used to pay down debt.
(2)   during the year ended december 31, 2014, we incurred a $0.3 million loss on debt extinguishment as a result of our march 2014 amendment to our senior secured credit agreement. we did not incur a similar charge during 2015.
(3)   see note 6, "fair value measurements" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our contingent payment arrangements.
(4)   the increase in interest and other income, net reflects an increase in customer finance fees of $1.3 million and a favorable impact due to a decrease in foreign currency losses of $0.5 million, including the impact of unrealized mark-to-market losses on foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge the purchase of inventory and, to a lesser extent, unrealized and realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the prior year.
provision for income taxes. our effective income tax rate was 33.9% for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to 34.7% for the year ended december 31, 2014. the lower effective tax rate in 2015 reflects a 0.5% benefit relative to the prior year as a result of an increase in earnings in our lower tax rate international operations. in addition, the effective tax rate for the current year benefited from discrete items, including favorable return to provision adjustments of $1.9 million and the favorable settlement of a canada tax matter totaling $1.8 million.
equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $2.0 million in our equity method investments. no tax benefit was recognized related to these charges. our share of net operating losses in our equity method investments totaled $4.1 million through the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $2.1 million during the prior year. with our divestiture of acm parts in february 2016, we expect our equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries to be nominal in 2016.
foreign currency impact. we translate our statements of income at the average exchange rates in effect for the period. relative to the average rates used in 2014, the pound sterling, euro and canadian dollar rates used to translate the 2015 statements of income declined by 7.2%, 16.4%, and 13.5%, respectively. the translation effect of the decline of these currencies against the u.s. dollar and realized and unrealized currency losses for the year resulted in an approximately $0.04 negative effect on diluted earnings per share relative to the prior year.

2014                                                                            2013                 organic             acquisition              foreign exchange              total change parts &amp; services revenue      $6,086,759                      $4,429,580                     9.0       %            27.8       %                0.6          %             37.4        %

total revenue                     $6,740,064                      $5,062,528                     7.1       %            25.5       %                0.6          %             33.1        %
note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
the change in parts and services revenue of 37.4% represents increases in segment revenue of 8.4% in north america, 46.6% in europe, and the addition of our specialty segment in 2014. refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to revenue growth during 2014 compared to the prior year.
cost of goods sold. our cost of goods sold increased to 60.7% of revenue in 2014 from 59.0% of revenue in 2013. the increase in cost of goods sold was primarily the result of lower margins generated by certain of our acquired businesses, which increased cost of goods sold by 2.0% of revenue. our keystone specialty business operates a three step distribution model, which generates lower gross margins compared to our revenue from sales directly to repairers, and therefore was responsible for 1.2% of the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue. our other acquisitions completed since the beginning of the prior year were responsible for the remainder of the acquisition impact on cost of goods sold, none of which had a material impact on our gross margins individually. partially offsetting the impact of our acquisitions, improvement in our north american gross margins decreased cost of goods sold by 0.4% of revenue. refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the changes in cost of goods sold by segment for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013.
facility and warehouse expenses. as a percentage of revenue, facility and warehouse expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014 decreased to 7.8% from 8.4% in the prior year, which was primarily due to the effect of our keystone specialty acquisition. as discussed in our current year section, specialty operates with lower facility and warehouse expenses than our north american operations.
distribution expenses. as a percentage of revenue, distribution expenses increased to 8.6% in 2014 from 8.5% in 2013, primarily due to greater costs in our european segment. in our u.k. operations, we incurred greater personnel expenditures as a result of 59 new branch openings since the beginning of the prior year, which increased distribution expenses by 0.1% of revenue.
selling, general and administrative expenses. our selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014 decreased to 11.3% of revenue from 11.8% of revenue in the prior year. our acquisitions contributed 0.4% of the reduction in expense, including primarily the effect of keystone specialty, which has lower selling, general and administrative costs compared to our other operations. greater leverage of our sales force and general and administrative personnel in our north american operations contributed an additional 0.3% improvement in costs as a percentage of revenue. these reductions in expense as a percentage of revenue were partially offset by greater expenses in our european operations, including greater expenditures for our sales force, primarily related to new branch openings, and higher advertising costs compared to the prior year period, which increased selling, general and administrative expenses by 0.2% of revenue.
restructuring and acquisition related expenses. the following table summarizes restructuring and acquisition related expenses for the periods indicated (in thousands):

depreciation and amortization. the following table provides additional information about the increase in depreciation and amortization compared to the prior year (in thousands):
year ended december 31,
2014                                                     2013                               change depreciation                              $86,216               $67,122               $19,094        (1)
amortization                               34,503                13,847                20,656        (2)
total depreciation and amortization      $120,719               $80,969               $39,750
(1)   the increase in depreciation is a result of increased levels of property and equipment to support our organic and acquisition related growth.
(2)   the increase in amortization is a result of amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisitions completed since the beginning of the prior year. we recognized $78.1 million of intangibles related to our january 2014 acquisition of keystone specialty and $45.3 million of intangibles related to our may 2013 acquisition of sator.
other expense, net. the following table summarizes the components of the year-over-year increase in other expense, net (in thousands):
other expense, net for the year ended december 31, 2013             $54,353
increase (decrease) due to:
interest expense                                                     13,358       (1)
loss on debt extinguishment                                          (2,471   )   (2)
changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities        (4,355   )   (3)
interest and other income, net                                        1,095       (4)
net increase                                                          7,627
other expense, net for the year ended december 31, 2014             $61,980
(1)   interest expense increased $17.8 million as a result of higher average outstanding debt levels, primarily to finance our keystone specialty and 2014 european acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease of $4.4 million as a result of lower interest rates relative to the prior year, primarily due to a lower applicable margin on our credit agreement borrowings as a result of our march 2014 amendment.
(2)   in 2014, we incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of $0.3 million related to the march 2014 amendment to our senior secured credit agreement, compared to a loss on debt extinguishment of $2.8 million during the prior year related to our may 2013 amendment to our senior secured credit credit agreement.
(3)   during 2014, we recorded gains of $1.9 million as a result of fair value adjustments to our contingent consideration liabilities, compared to losses of $2.5 million in the prior year. see note 6, "fair value measurements" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our contingent payment arrangements.
(4)   interest and other income, net decreased primarily due to $0.9 million of greater losses as a result of foreign currency exchange for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013.
see note 4, "long-term obligations" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on the amendments to our credit agreement.
provision for income taxes. our effective income tax rate was 34.7% for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to 34.5% for the year ended december 31, 2013. the lower effective income tax rate in 2013 primarily reflects the discrete benefit related to the revaluation of our net u.k. deferred tax liabilities as a result of reductions in the u.k. corporate income tax rate.
equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. our share of net operating losses in our equity method investments totaled $2.1 million through the year ended december 31, 2014. net operating losses during the year ended december 31, 2013 were not material.
44
foreign currency impact. we translate our statements of income at the average exchange rates in effect for the period. relative to the average rates used in 2013, the canadian dollar and euro rates used to translate the 2014 statements of income declined by 6.8% and 0.5%, respectively and the pound sterling rate increased by 5.3%. the translation effect of the change in these currencies against the u.s. dollar and realized and unrealized currency losses for the year resulted in approximately a $0.01 positive effect on diluted earnings per share relative to the prior year.
45
results of operations-segment reporting we have four operating segments: wholesale - north america; europe; specialty; and self service. our specialty operating segment was formed with our january 3, 2014 acquisition of keystone specialty, as discussed in note 8, "business combinations" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. our wholesale - north america and self service operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment, north america, because they possess similar economic characteristics and have common products and services, customers, and methods of distribution. therefore, we present three reportable segments: north america, europe and specialty.
we evaluate growth and profitability in our operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis. the constant currency presentation, which is a non-gaap ("generally accepted accounting principles") measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. we believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our growth and profitability, consistent with how we evaluate our performance. constant currency segment ebitda results are calculated by translating prior year segment ebitda in local currency using the current year's currency conversion rate. this non-gaap measure has important limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap. our use of this term may vary from the use of similarly-titled measures by other issuers due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation.
the following table presents our financial performance, including third party revenue, total revenue and segment ebitda, by reportable segment for the periods indicated (in thousands):

the key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our chief operating decision maker, who is our chief executive officer, is segment ebitda. segment ebitda includes revenue and expenses that are controllable by the segment. corporate and administrative expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage, with shared expenses apportioned based on the segment's percentage of consolidated revenue. segment ebitda is calculated as ebitda excluding restructuring and acquisition related expenses, change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. ebitda, which is the basis for segment ebitda, is calculated as net income excluding depreciation, amortization, interest (including loss on debt extinguishment) and taxes. loss on debt extinguishment is considered a component of interest in calculating ebitda, as the write-off of debt issuance costs is similar to the treatment of debt issuance cost amortization. see note 13, "segment and geographic information" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for a reconciliation of total segment ebitda to net income.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   the acquisition growth in revenue reflects the impact of 13 wholesale businesses and 3 self service retail operations acquired since the beginning of 2014 up to the one year anniversary of the acquisition date.
(2)   approximately 60% of our organic growth in parts and services revenue was due to increased net pricing in our wholesale operations. in our aftermarket operations, we increased our net prices to customers compared to the prior year. in our salvage operations, we shifted our salvage vehicle purchasing to higher quality vehicles beginning in the third quarter of 2014, which increased the average revenue per part sold during 2015. the remainder of our organic growth in parts and services revenue was primarily due to increased sales volumes in our salvage operations and to a lesser extent, our aftermarket operations.
(3)   approximately $161 million of the $187 million organic decline in other revenue was a result of lower prices received from the sale of scrap and other metals. this was primarily due to lower prices from the sale of crushed auto bodies, which fluctuate based on steel prices. lower sales volumes were responsible for the remaining decline, primarily due to fewer vehicles processed relative to the prior year.
segment ebitda. segment ebitda increased $3.5 million, or 0.6%, in 2015 compared to the prior year. the decline in scrap steel and other metals prices as described in the revenue section above had a negative year over year impact of $34.4 million on north american segment ebitda and a $0.07 negative effect on diluted earnings per share relative to the prior year.
the following table summarizes the changes in segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue in our north american segment:
north america                                                                        percentage of total segment revenue segment ebitda for the year ended december 31, 2014                                          13.3                      %
increase (decrease) due to:
change in gross margin                                                                        0.4                      %                    (1)

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   the improvement in gross margin reflects a 0.2% favorable impact from our aftermarket product lines and a 0.1% favorable mix impact resulting from more revenue being derived from our wholesale operations, which have higher gross margin percentages relative to our self service operations during periods when scrap and other metal prices decline. in our aftermarket products, we improved our gross margin through increases in net prices to our customers. despite the continued decline in scrap and other metal prices, margins in our self service operations have remained consistent year over year, resulting from the continued effort to reduce car costs and purchase higher quality cars that will yield more parts revenue per vehicle to offset the loss in scrap and other metal revenue.
(2)   the decline in segment ebitda margin related to operating expenses was primarily the result of the negative impact on operating leverage caused by the decrease in other revenue related to the declining prices of scrap steel and other metals. in periods of falling scrap revenue, we do not experience a commensurate decline in operating expenses, as we
47
have few variable costs associated with the sale of scrap and other metals. the 0.5% increase in segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue included an unfavorable impact of 1.1% related to the decline in prices for scrap steel and other metals. this increase was partially offset by an improvement in segment operating expenses of 0.6%, which is primarily the result of a 0.4% improvement in distribution expenses due to a reduction in fuel costs.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   in our u.k. operations, parts and services revenue grew organically by 11.8%, while in our continental european operations, parts and services revenue grew organically by 2.8%, resulting in net organic revenue growth of 9.2% over the prior year. our organic revenue growth in the u.k., which resulted from higher sales volumes, was composed of a 7.5% increase in revenue from stores open more than 12 months and a 4.3% increase from revenue generated by 54 branch openings since the beginning of the prior year through the one year anniversary of their respective opening dates. organic revenue growth in our continental european operations was primarily due to the opening of a new warehouse location in france in 2014 and, to a lesser extent, growth in our belgian market.
(2)   acquisition related growth for the year-ended december 31, 2015 includes $158.1 million from our acquisitions of 18 distribution companies in the netherlands since the beginning of 2014 and the purchase of a salvage business in sweden through the one year anniversary of the acquisitions.
(3)   compared to the prior year, exchange rates reduced our revenue growth by $179.8 million, or 9.7%, primarily due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against both the pound sterling and euro relative to 2014.
segment ebitda. segment ebitda increased $33.4 million, or 20%, to $200.6 million through the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $167.2 million in the prior year. our european segment ebitda includes a negative year over year impact of $15.7 million related to the translation of local currency results into u.s. dollars at lower exchange rates than those experienced during 2014. on a constant currency basis (i.e. excluding the translation impact), segment ebitda increased by $49.1 million, or 29.4%, compared to the prior year. refer to the foreign currency impact discussion within the results of operations - consolidated section above for further detail regarding foreign currency impact on our results for the year ended december 31, 2015. the following table summarizes the changes in segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue in our european segment:

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   the increase in gross margin reflects improvement of 0.7% in our uk operations, primarily as a result of a reduction in product costs and an increase in supplier rebates, and 0.6% in our continental european operations as a result of internalizing incremental gross margin from our 2014 acquisitions of seven netherlands distributors.
(2)   the increase in segment operating expenses reflects higher selling, general and administrative expenses of 0.5%, related to higher personnel costs to support the growth of the business, including our e-commerce business, in the uk
48
and continental europe. distribution costs improved over the prior year period by 0.2% due to internalizing previously outsourced delivery expenses as well as lower fuel costs.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   organic growth in specialty parts and services revenue reflects increased sales volumes as a result of favorable economic conditions.
(2)   acquisition related growth reflects the impact of two specialty businesses acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014, as well as the acquisition of coast on august 19, 2015.
(3)   compared to the prior year, exchange rates reduced our revenue growth by 1.9%, primarily due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the canadian dollar in 2015 compared to the prior year.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   the decline in gross margin reflects a 0.7% increase in inventory costs, most of which we expect to be temporary as integration plans are completed, and a decrease in gross margin of 0.4% due to unfavorable net customer pricing. our acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2014 of a supplier of parts for recreational vehicles resulted in a 0.4% decline in gross margin compared to the prior year. compared to our existing specialty business, this acquisition realizes lower gross margins than our other specialty product sales. these negative effects on gross margin were partially offset by a favorable mix effect of 0.2% resulting from a shift toward higher margin product lines, particularly truck and off road products.
(2)   reflects a 0.8% reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue related to (i) a 0.6% decline in personnel expenses as a percentage of revenue primarily as a result of integration synergies and (ii) a reduction in professional fees and advertising expenses of 0.2%. distribution expenses decreased 0.7% due to (i) favorable fuel pricing compared to the prior year of 0.6%, (ii) logistics synergies as we leverage our north american distribution network for the delivery of specialty products of 0.5%, partially offset by (iii) higher freight costs of 0.4% driven by higher use of third party freight to handle increased volumes, as well as sales related to our october 2014 acquisition of a supplier of parts for recreational vehicles and our 2015 acquisition of coast, which are all shipped via third party carriers. we expect to realize additional integration synergies throughout 2016 as we continue to rationalize our facilities within this segment.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   reflects the impact of 9 wholesale businesses and 2 self service retail operations acquired during 2014.
(2)   our organic growth in parts and services revenue was primarily due to higher sales volumes, as severe winter weather conditions during the second half of the fourth quarter of 2013 and through the first quarter of 2014 contributed to increased vehicle accidents, resulting in higher insurance claims activity. in addition, we believe the increased new car production since 2009 and greater miles driven has increased the demand for automotive parts used in repairs, including alternative parts. industry reports also indicate that the number of parts used in each insured repair is increasing compared to historical levels.
(3)   approximately half of the reduction in other revenue was due to reduced volume of scrap and other metals, with the remaining decline a result of lower prices for scrap and other metals. compared to the prior year, our furnace operations processed lower volumes of aluminum. additionally, we purchased fewer self service and "crush only" cars in the first quarter of 2014 as the prices demanded for vehicles in certain markets exceeded our acceptable cost given the prices of scrap and other metals. while we increased our purchasing levels during the remainder of the year to offset the shortfall, we crushed fewer vehicles compared to the prior year period due to the lag time to process these cars.
segment ebitda. segment ebitda increased $57.1 million, or 11.7%, in 2014 compared to the prior year. the decline in scrap steel and other metals prices as described in the revenue section above had a negative year over year impact of $9.6 million on north american segment ebitda and a $0.02 negative effect on diluted earnings per share relative to the prior year.
the following table summarizes the changes in segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue in our north american segment:

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   our wholesale operations increased gross margin by 0.6%, including a 0.5% improvement from lower inventory purchase costs and a favorable mix effect of 0.2% as a result of generating less revenue from our lower margin sales of scrap and precious metals. the improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was partially offset by the impact of our acquisition of an automotive core business in january 2014, which increased our revenue in product lines that are complementary to our existing vehicle replacement parts offerings but generate lower gross margins, thereby decreasing gross margins by 0.5% of revenue.
(2)   selling, general and administrative expenses declined by 0.5% of revenue, primarily due to improved leverage of our
50
sales force and general and administrative personnel, but this was partially offset by an increase of facility and warehouse expenses by 0.2% of revenue due to higher personnel expenditures.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   in our u.k. operations, revenue grew organically by 20.6%, while our continental european operations were flat with the prior year post-acquisition period, resulting in net organic revenue growth of 16.1% over the prior year. our organic revenue growth in the u.k., which resulted from higher sales volumes, was composed of a 13.3% increase from stores open more than 12 months and a 7.3% increase from revenue generated by 59 branch openings since the beginning of the prior year through the one year anniversary of their respective opening dates. in our continental european operations, a new warehouse location in france resulted in greater sales volumes compared to the prior year period, but this growth was offset by a decline in sales into eastern europe as a result of the devaluation of local currencies and political instability.
(2)   includes $131.3 million from our may 2013 acquisition of sator, $85.6 million from our august 2013 acquisitions of five paint distributors in the u.k. and $100.3 million from our 2014 acquisitions of seven distribution companies in the netherlands.
(3)   compared to the prior year, exchange rates contributed 3.6% of the revenue growth, primarily due to the strengthening of the british pound against the u.s. dollar in the first nine months of 2014. while exchanges rates positively affected revenue on a year-to-date basis, the british pound weakened against the u.s. dollar in the fourth quarter to partially offset the benefit realized during the first nine months of the year.
segment ebitda. segment ebitda increased $25.4 million, or 17.9%, in 2014 compared to the prior year. our european segment ebitda includes a positive year over year impact of $6.3 million related to the strengthening of the pound sterling relative to the u.s. dollar in 2014. on a constant currency basis (i.e. excluding the translation impact), segment ebitda increased by $19.1 million, or 13.5%, compared to the prior year. refer to the foreign currency impact discussion within the results of operations - consolidated section above for further detail regarding the foreign currency impact on our results for the year ended december 31, 2014. the following table summarizes the changes in segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue in our european segment:

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   our acquisitions completed since the beginning of the prior year were responsible for 1.1% of the decline in segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue, including primarily the effect of the netherlands distributors we acquired in may 2014. the effect of the netherlands distributors includes a negative gross margin impact of 0.3% that will not affect future periods once the higher cost acquired inventory has turned and we are able to internalize the incremental
51
distributor margin. additionally, as we transition our continental european operations to a two step distribution model, including the effect of these acquisitions, our operating expenses will increase as we internalize the cost of the distribution network; during the year ended december 31, 2014, these greater operating costs resulted in a decline in segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue, thereby accounting for the remaining negative impact on segment ebitda margins. our existing operations were responsible for the remaining decline in segment ebitda, including a 0.7% effect from 59 new branch openings in the u.k. since the beginning of the prior year in our u.k. operations. additionally, we incurred 0.2% in higher advertising expenses compared to the prior year.
specialty because our specialty segment was formed on january 3, 2014 with our keystone specialty acquisition, the discussion of our consolidated results of operations covers the factors driving the year-over-year performance of our existing business and also discusses the effect of the specialty operations on our consolidated results. compared to keystone specialty's unaudited results for the year ended december 31, 2013, revenue in our specialty segment increased 15.8%. during the fourth quarter of 2014, we completed two additional acquisitions in our specialty segment, which contributed approximately one quarter of the revenue growth. the remaining revenue growth was primarily due to greater sales volumes as a result of favorable economic conditions. additionally, during the year ended december 31, 2014, we generated a greater proportion of revenue from our higher-end specialty vehicle products, such as truck and rv accessories, which resulted in a favorable mix of revenue compared to the prior year unaudited results.
2016 outlook we estimate that adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ending december 31, 2016, excluding the impact of any restructuring and acquisition related expenses, amortization expense related to acquired intangibles and any gains or losses related to acquisitions or divestitures (including changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities), will be in the range of $490 million to $520 million and $1.59 to $1.69, respectively.

total liquidity (cash and equivalents plus availability on credit facilities)       1,425,050               1,242,415
(1) debt amounts reflect the gross values to be repaid (excluding debt issuance costs of $15.0 million and $18.4 million as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively).
(2) includes our revolving credit facilities, our receivables securitization facility, and letters of credit. the amounts do not reflect the impact of the amendment to our senior secured credit facility on january 29, 2016.
we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to fund our operations and provide for expansion through both internal development and acquisitions. our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and our credit facilities. we utilize our cash flows from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures, with the excess amounts going towards funding acquisitions or paying down outstanding debt. as we have pursued acquisitions as part of our growth strategy, our cash flows from operations have not always been sufficient to cover our investing activities. to fund our acquisitions, we have accessed various forms of debt financing, including our march 2014 amendment to our senior secured credit facilities and the issuance of $600 million of senior notes in may 2013.
as of december 31, 2015, we had debt outstanding and additional available sources of financing, as follows:
52
•   senior secured credit facilities maturing in may 2019, composed of $450 million in term loans ($411 million outstanding at december 31, 2015) and $1.85 billion in revolving credit ($480 million outstanding at december 31, 2015), bearing interest at variable rates (although a portion of this debt is hedged through interest rate swap contracts)
•   senior notes totaling $600 million, maturing in may 2023 and bearing interest at a 4.75% fixed rate
•   receivables securitization facility with availability up to $97 million ($63 million outstanding as of december 31, 2015), maturing in october 2017 and bearing interest at variable commercial paper rates on january 29, 2016, lkq corporation, lkq delaware llp, and certain other subsidiaries entered into a fourth amended and restated credit agreement to (1) extend the maturity date by approximately two years to january 29, 2021; (2) increase the total availability under the credit agreement from $2.3 billion to $3.2 billion (composed of $2.45 billion in the revolving credit facility's multicurrency component; and $750 million of term loans, which consist of a term loan of approximately $500 million and a €230 million term loan); (3) increase our ability to incur additional indebtedness; and (4) make other immaterial or clarifying modifications and amendments to the terms of the third amended and restated credit agreement. see note 4, "long-term obligations" within the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information related to our long-term obligations.
from time to time, we may undertake financing transactions to increase our available liquidity, such as our january 2016 amendment to our senior secured credit facilities and our september 2014 amendment to our receivables securitization facility. our financing structure, which includes our senior secured credit facilities, senior notes, and receivables securitization facility, provides financial flexibility to execute our long-term growth strategy. if we see an attractive acquisition opportunity, we have the ability to move quickly and have certainty of funding up to the amount of our then-available liquidity.
as of december 31, 2015, we had approximately $1.3 billion available under our credit facilities. combined with approximately $87.4 million of cash and equivalents at december 31, 2015, we had approximately $1.4 billion in available liquidity, an increase of $182.6 million over our available liquidity as of december 31, 2014.
after giving effect to the january 2016 amendment, we will have an additional $600 million of availability under our revolving credit facilities and an increase in term loan borrowings of approximately $339 million which, combined with our existing capacity, will be used to finance the potential rhiag acquisition. total consideration transferred for the purchase price is expected to include approximately $616 million of cash and approximately $500 million in assumed debt. we plan to refinance the assumed debt with revolver borrowings under our secured credit facility and/or other long term obligations. additional amounts are expected to be transferred for acquisition related costs.
we believe that our current liquidity and cash expected to be generated by operating activities in future periods will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements, although such sources may not be sufficient for future acquisitions depending on their size. while we believe that with the amended credit facility we have adequate capacity, from time to time, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic relationships or other arrangements. there can be no assurance that additional funding, or refinancing of our credit facilities, if needed, will be available on terms attractive to us, or at all. furthermore, any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants or higher interest costs. our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
borrowings under the credit agreement accrue interest at variable rates, which depend on the currency and the duration of the borrowing, plus an applicable margin rate which is subject to change quarterly based on our reported leverage ratio. we hold interest rate swaps to hedge the variable rates on a portion of our credit agreement borrowings (as described in note 5, "derivative instruments and hedging activities" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k), with the effect of fixing the interest rates on the respective notional amounts. after giving effect to these interest rate swap contracts, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement at december 31, 2015 was 1.76%. including the borrowings on our senior notes and receivables securitization program, our overall weighted average interest rate on borrowings was 2.89% at december 31, 2015. cash interest payments were $54.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, including interest payments totaling $28.5 million related to our senior notes. the semi-annual interest payments on our senior notes are made in may and november each year, and began in november 2013. we had outstanding credit agreement borrowings of $0.9 billion and $1.1 billion at december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively. of these amounts, $22.5 million were classified as current maturities at december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014.
under the terms of the january 2016 amendment, we have scheduled repayments of $3.1 million for the fiscal quarters ending on june 30, 2016, september 30, 2016 and december 31, 2016, and $6.2 million each fiscal quarter thereafter through the maturity of the usd term loan maturity in january 2021. we also have scheduled repayments of €1.4 million for the fiscal quarters ending on june 30, 2016, september 30, 2016 and december 31, 2016, and €2.9 million each fiscal quarter thereafter
53
through the maturity of the euro term loan in january 2021. we have no other significant principal payments on our credit facilities scheduled prior to the maturity of the receivables securitization program in october 2017. in addition to the repayments under our credit facilities, we will make payments on notes payable and other debt totaling $35.0 million in the next 12 months.
our credit agreement contains customary covenants that provide limitations and conditions on our ability to enter into certain transactions. the credit agreement also contains financial and affirmative covenants, including limitations on our net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants under our credit agreement as of december 31, 2015.
as of december 31, 2015, the company had cash of $87.4 million, of which $59.4 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. we consider the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested, and accordingly no provision for u.s. income taxes has been provided thereon. should these earnings be repatriated in the future, in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to both u.s. income taxes (subject to adjustment for foreign tax credits) and potential withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. we believe that we have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to meet our financial obligations in the u.s. without resort to repatriation of foreign earnings.
year ended december 31, 2015 compared to year ended december 31, 2014
the procurement of inventory is the largest operating use of our funds. we normally pay for aftermarket product purchases at the time of shipment or on standard payment terms, depending on the manufacturer and the negotiated payment terms. we normally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under direct procurement arrangements at the time that we take possession of the vehicles.
the following table sets forth a summary of our aftermarket inventory procurement for 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):

(1)   in north america, we accelerated our aftermarket inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of 2014 in anticipation of potential labor issues at west coast ports in the u.s., leading to growth in the year-end inventory balance. as a result, our aftermarket inventory purchases in the first half of 2015 fell below 2014 levels. during the second half of 2015, we increased our aftermarket inventory purchases above the prior year levels as a result of an increase in sales and the depletion of the inventory acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014. our july 2015 acquisition of parts channel also contributed to the increase in purchases in the second half of 2015. for the year ended december 31, 2015, our north american purchases were $38.1 million higher than the prior year.
(2)   in our european segment, our acquisitions of the netherlands distributors in 2014 and 2015 contributed incremental inventory purchases of $49.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. purchases for our u.k. operations increased in 2015 compared to the prior period primarily as a result of opening five new regional distribution centers. however, the greater purchase levels in europe were partially offset by the devaluation of the pound sterling and euro compared to the prior year period.
(3)   the increase in specialty aftermarket inventory purchases of $163.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2015, was related to accelerated inventory purchases to stock two new distribution centers scheduled to open in the first quarter of 2016. our august 2015 acquisition of coast and our october 2014 acquisition of a supplier of parts for recreational vehicles also contributed to the increase in purchases compared to prior year period.
the following table sets forth a summary of our salvage and self service procurement for 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):

54
(1)   the increase in our salvage car and truck purchases is primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of purchasing activity related to our november 2014 acquisition of a business with salvage and vehicle repair facilities in sweden and norway.
(2)   compared to the prior year, we reduced our purchases of lower cost self service and "crush only" cars as prices demanded for vehicles in certain markets exceeded our acceptable cost given the prices of scrap and other metals. the decrease in purchases was partially offset by the acquisition of a self service yard operation in 2015.
net cash provided by operating activities totaled $529.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to $370.9 million in 2014. compared to the prior year, our 2015 ebitda increased by $52.9 million, due to both acquisition related growth and organic growth. cash outflows for our primary working capital accounts (receivables, inventory and payables) totaled $72.7 million during 2015 compared to $189.8 million during 2014. in 2015, cash outflows for inventory totaled $83.2 million as a result of inventory growth, particularly in our specialty operations; cash outflows for inventory were $122.6 million in the prior year. as discussed above, we increased our north american aftermarket inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of 2014 in anticipation of port issues in the u.s., which resulted in a larger cash outflow in the prior year as compared to 2015. accounts receivable represented a cash inflow of $14.7 million in 2015 compared to a cash outflow of $61.7 million in 2014. in europe, our netherlands operations experienced a reduction in accounts receivable in 2015 as result of a higher rate of collections due to the implementation of an automatic payment program. in the prior year, receivables balances increased primarily as a result of increased sales levels in our u.k. operations. cash flows related to our primary working capital accounts can be volatile as the purchases, payments and collections can be timed differently from period to period and can be influenced by factors outside of our control. however, we expect that the net change in these working capital items will generally be a cash outflow as we grow our business each year.
net cash used in investing activities totaled $330.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to $921.0 million in 2014. we invested $160.5 million of cash, net of cash acquired, in business acquisitions during 2015, compared to $775.9 million for business acquisitions in 2014, which included $427.1 million for our keystone specialty acquisition. property and equipment purchases were $170.5 million in the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $141.0 million in the prior year. the increase in capital expenditures relative to the prior year period reflects an increase of $33.0 million in our u.k. operations primarily due to costs incurred to develop and equip a new distribution center. during 2015, cash provided by other investing activities, net was $1.0 million and primarily consisted of proceeds from disposals of fixed assets totaling $10.7 million, partially offset by payments of $9.7 million for investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, including a $7.5 million payment to increase our investment in acm parts. during 2014, we paid $2.2 million for investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries.
net cash used in financing activities totaled $224.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to an inflow of $519.0 million in 2014. during 2015, net repayments under our credit facilities were $186.5 million compared to net borrowings of $578.4 million in 2014. compared to the prior year period, our cash investment in acquisitions was lower, and therefore, we used the excess cash generated by operations to repay outstanding amounts under our revolving credit facilities. during 2014, we used the proceeds from the net borrowings primarily to fund acquisitions, including $370 million of revolver borrowings and $80 million of borrowings under our receivables facility to finance the keystone specialty acquisition. our march 2014 amendment of our credit facilities generated $11.3 million in additional term loan borrowings, which were used to pay $3.7 million in debt issuance costs related to the amendment, as well as to repay outstanding revolver borrowings. during 2014, we made a payment of $44.8 million ($39.5 million included in financing cash flows and $5.3 million included in operating cash flows) for the final earnout period under the contingent payment agreement related to our 2011 ecp acquisition. cash generated from exercises of stock options provided $8.2 million and $9.3 million in the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the excess tax benefit from share-based payment arrangements reduced income taxes payable by $14.4 million and $17.8 million in the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we paid $7.6 million and $0.4 million related to taxes for net share settlements of stock-based compensation in the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we paid $12.6 million related to the settlement of foreign currency forward contracts; no such payment occurred in 2015.

(1)   in north america, we increased our aftermarket inventory purchases above the prior year levels as a result of an increase in sales. additionally, we accelerated our aftermarket inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of 2014 in anticipation of potential labor issues at west coast ports in the u.s., leading to an increase in the year-end inventory balance compared to 2013.
(2)   in our european segment, our acquisitions of five netherlands distributors in 2014 contributed incremental inventory purchases of $63.5 million. our ecp operations contributed incremental inventory purchases of $146.4 million as a result of opening 44 new branches in 2014 and the appreciation of the pound sterling compared to 2013.
(3)   our specialty operating segment was formed with our january 3, 2014 acquisition of keystone specialty, as discussed in note 8, "business combinations." total purchases in 2014 include both keystone specialty and our october 2014 acquisition of a supplier of replacement parts, supplies and accessories for rvs.

net cash provided by operating activities totaled $370.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to $428.1 million in 2013. compared to the prior year, our 2014 ebitda increased by $159.6 million, due to both acquisition related growth and organic growth. cash outflows for our primary working capital accounts (receivables, inventory and payables) increased to $189.8 million during 2014, from $64.3 million during 2013, as a result of greater inventory growth, particularly in our aftermarket products, as well as increased receivables balances, including the effect of increased sales levels in our u.k. operations. cash flows related to our primary working capital accounts can be volatile as the purchases, payments and collections can be timed differently from period to period and can be influenced by factors outside of our control. however, we expect that the net change in these working capital items will generally be a cash outflow as we grow our business each year. cash paid for income taxes increased to $177.0 million from $110.9 million due to the overpayment of taxes in 2012 that we offset against the estimated tax payments in 2013, as well as greater earnings that required higher estimated tax payments in 2014 compared to the prior year. during 2014, we made two semi-annual interest payments totaling $28.5 million on our senior notes, whereas in 2013 we made one semi-annual interest payment of $14.2 million. cash payments for bonuses were $7.8 million higher during 2014 than they were in 2013.
net cash used in investing activities totaled $921.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to $505.6 million for the same period of 2013.we invested $775.9 million of cash, net of cash acquired, in business acquisitions during 2014, including $427.1 million for our keystone specialty acquisition. we invested $408.4 million for business acquisitions in the comparable prior year, including our acquisition of sator for $272.8 million. property and equipment purchases were $141.0 million in the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $90.2 million in the prior year. the increase in capital expenditures relative to the prior year period reflects an increase of $17.4 million in our u.k. operations, including greater expenditures for leasehold improvements and vehicles for 44 new branch locations opened during the year ended december 31, 2014. capital expenditures in our north american segment increased by $19.9 million, primarily due to costs incurred to build a facility that we subsequently sold and leased back from the buyer. the proceeds of the sale-leaseback transaction are reflected as financing cash inflows in the year ended december 31, 2014. in 2013, we entered into an agreement with suncorp group to develop an alternative vehicle products business in australia and new zealand, for which our initial investment totaled $9.1 million; during 2014, we paid $2.2 million for investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries.

net cash provided by financing activities totaled $519.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to $165.9 million in 2013. during 2014, net borrowings under our credit facilities were $578.4 million compared to net borrowings of $227.1 million in 2013. in both periods, we used the proceeds from the net borrowings primarily to fund acquisitions, including borrowings to finance our acquisition of keystone specialty in 2014 and our acquisition of sator in 2013. during 2013, we completed a $600 million senior notes offering, as well as an amendment to our credit agreement that resulted in $35 million in term loan proceeds, which were used to pay $16.9 million in debt issuance costs as well as to repay outstanding amounts on our revolving credit facilities. in march 2013, we made a payment of $33.9 million ($31.5 million included in financing cash flows and $2.4 million included in operating cash flows) for the 2012 earnout period under the contingent payment agreement related to our 2011 ecp acquisition; we made a similar payment of $44.8 million in 2014 ($39.5 million included in financing cash flows and $5.3 million included in operating cash flows) for the final earnout period. cash generated from exercises of stock options provided $9.3 million and $15.4 million in the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the excess tax benefit from share-based payment arrangements reduced income taxes payable by $17.8 million and $18.3 million in the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we paid $12.6 million related to the settlement of foreign currency forward contracts.
we intend to continue to evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of distribution centers, processing and sales facilities, and warehouses, through further integration of our facilities, and through selected business acquisitions. our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including the costs and timing of our internal development efforts and the success of those efforts, the costs and timing of expansion of our sales and marketing activities, and the costs and timing of future business acquisitions.
2016 outlook we estimate that our capital expenditures for 2016, excluding business acquisitions, will be between $170 million and $180 million. we expect to use these funds for the development of a new distribution center in the u.k., several major facility expansions, improvement of current facilities, real estate acquisitions and systems development projects. we anticipate that net cash provided by operating activities for 2016 will be between $520 million and $550 million off-balance sheet arrangements and future commitments we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or undisclosed borrowings or debt that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to item 303 of regulation s-k under the securities exchange act of 1934. additionally, we do not have any synthetic leases.

(1)   our long-term debt under contractual obligations above includes interest on the balances outstanding as of december 31, 2015. the long-term debt balance excludes debt issuances costs as these expenses have already been paid. interest on our senior notes, notes payable, and other long-term debt is calculated based on the respective stated rates. interest on our variable rate credit facilities is calculated based on the weighted average rates, including the impact of interest rate swaps through their respective expiration dates, in effect for each tranche of borrowings as of december 31, 2015. future estimated interest expense for the next year, one to three years, and three to five years is $45.2 million, $88.2 million and $69.5 million, respectively. estimated interest expense beyond five years is $71.9 million.
(2)   interest on capital lease obligations is included based on incremental borrowing or implied rates. future estimated interest expense for the next year, one to three years, and three to five years is $0.3 million, $0.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively. estimated interest expense beyond five years is $8.2 million.
(3)   the operating lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year. historically, these expenses have averaged approximately 25% of the corresponding lease payments.
(4)   our purchase obligations include open purchase orders for aftermarket inventory.
(5)   our contingent consideration liabilities reflect the undiscounted estimated payments of additional consideration related to business combinations. the actual payments will be determined at the end of the applicable performance periods based on the acquired entities' achievement of the targets specified in the purchase agreements.
(6)   includes asset purchase commitments related to the construction of a new distribution center for our u.k. operations, commitments to purchase land and buildings, it related expenditures, and other asset purchase commitments.
(7)   self-insurance reserves include undiscounted estimated payments, net of estimated insurance recoveries, for our employee medical benefits, automobile liability, general liability, directors and officers liability, workers' compensation and property insurance.
(8)   deferred compensation payments are dependent on elected payment dates. while we expect that these payments will be made more than five years from the latest balance sheet date, payments may be made earlier depending on such elections. our deferred compensation plans are funded through investments in life insurance policies. other retirement obligations consist of our expected required contributions to sator's pension plan. we have not included future funding requirements beyond 2016 in the table above, as these funding projections are not practicable to estimate.

item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
you should read the following discussion together with the financial statements, including the related notes and the other financial information, contained in this annual report on form 10-k.
general eldorado resorts, inc. ("eri" or the "company"), a nevada corporation, was formed in september 2013 to be the parent company following the merger of wholly owned subsidiaries of the company into eldorado holdco llc ("holdco"), a nevada limited liability company formed in 2009 that is the parent company of eldorado resorts llc ("resorts"), and mtr gaming group, inc. ("mtr gaming"), a delaware corporation incorporated in 1988 (the "merger"). effective upon the consummation of the merger on september 19, 2014 (the "merger date"), mtr gaming and holdco each became a wholly owned subsidiary of eri and, as a result of such transactions, resorts became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of eri.
resorts owns and operates the eldorado resort casino reno, a premier hotel, casino and entertainment facility centrally located in downtown reno, nevada (the "eldorado reno"), which opened for business in 1973. resorts also owns eldorado resort casino shreveport ("eldorado shreveport"), a 403‐room all suite art deco‐style hotel and a tri‐level riverboat dockside casino complex situated on the red river in shreveport, louisiana, which commenced operations under its previous owners in december 2000.
prior to the acquisition date, resorts owned a 48.1% interest in the joint venture (the "silver legacy joint venture") which owns the silver legacy resort casino (the "silver legacy"), a major themed hotel and casino situated between and seamlessly connected at the mezzanine level to the eldorado reno and circus reno, (collectively the "reno tri-properties"), a hotel and casino previously owned and operated by galleon, inc., an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of mgm resorts international.
on november 24, 2015, resorts consummated the circus reno/silver legacy purchase pursuant to that certain purchase and sale agreement, dated as of july 7, 2015 (the "purchase agreement"), entered into by certain of our subsidiaries with circus circus casinos, inc. and galleon, inc., each an affiliate of mgm resorts international, with respect to the acquisition. on the acquisition date, eldorado resorts llc also exercised its right to acquire the 3.8% interest in eldorado limited liability company ("ellc") held by certain affiliates and shareholders of the company. as a result of these transactions, ellc and cc-reno, llc, a newly formed nevada limited liability company, became wholly-owned subsidiaries of eri, and silver legacy became an indirect wholly‐owned subsidiary of eri.
resorts previously owned a 21.3% interest in tamarack crossing, llc ("tamarack"), a nevada limited liability company that owned and operated tamarack junction, a casino in south reno which commenced operations on september 4, 2001. on september 1, 2014, and as a condition to closing the merger, resorts distributed to holdco, and holdco subsequently distributed to its members on a pro rata basis resorts' interest in tamarack. no gain or loss was recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as a result of such distribution because the distribution was in the amount of the book value of tamarack and totaled $5.5 million.
mtr gaming operates as a hospitality and gaming company with racetrack, gaming and hotel properties in west virginia, pennsylvania and ohio. mtr gaming, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, owns and operates mountaineer casino, racetrack & resort in chester, west virginia ("mountaineer"), presque isle downs & casino in erie, pennsylvania ("presque isle downs"), and eldorado gaming scioto downs ("scioto downs") in columbus, ohio. scioto downs, through its subsidiary, racelinebet, inc., also operates racelinebet.com, a national account wagering service that offers online and telephone wagering on horse races as a marketing affiliate of twinspires.com, an affiliate of churchill downs, inc.
presentation of financial information eri, holdco and mtr gaming are collectively referred to as "we," "us," "our" or the "company." the financial information included in this item 7 for periods prior to the acquisition date are those of resorts and its
32
subsidiaries including eldorado reno, eldorado shreveport, mtr gaming and its interest in the silver legacy joint venture.
the merger closed on the merger date and has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition of mtr gaming by holdco under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("us gaap"). as a result, holdco is considered the acquirer of mtr gaming for accounting purposes. the financial information included in this item 7 for periods prior to the merger date are those of holdco and its subsidiaries. the presentation of information herein for periods prior to the merger date and the acquisition date and after the merger date and acquisition date, respectively, are not fully comparable because the results of operations for mtr gaming and circus reno are not included for periods prior to the merger date or acquisition date, respectively, and the results of operations of the silver legacy joint venture were not consolidated prior to the acquisition date. summary financial results of mtr gaming for the year ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 are included in mtr gaming's annual report on form 10‐k as filed with the securities and exchange commission ("sec").
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is intended to provide information to assist in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. our historical operating results may not be indicative of our future results of operations because of these factors and the changing competitive landscape in each of our markets, as well as by factors discussed elsewhere herein. we recommend that you read this md&a in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included in this annual report.
reportable segments the company has aggregated its operating segments into three reportable segments: eldorado reno, silver legacy and circus reno as nevada, eldorado shreveport as louisiana, and scioto downs, presque isle downs and mountaineer as eastern.  key performance metrics our primary source of revenue is generated by our gaming operations, but we use our hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment, retail shops, racing and other services to attract customers to our properties. our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers visiting and staying at our properties. key performance metrics include volume indicators such as table games drop and slot handle, which refer to amounts wagered by our customers. the amount of volume we retain, which is not fully controllable by us, is recognized as casino revenues and is referred to as our win or hold. in addition, hotel occupancy and price per room designated by average daily rate ("adr") are key indicators for our hotel business. our calculation of adr consists of the average price of occupied rooms per day including the impact of complimentary rooms. complimentary room rates are determined based on an analysis of retail or cash rates for each customer segment and each type of room product to estimate complimentary rates which are consistent with retail rates. complimentary rates are reviewed at least annually and on an interim basis if there are significant changes in market conditions. complimentary rooms are treated as occupied rooms in our calculation of hotel occupancy. significant factors impacting financial results the following summary highlights the significant factors impacting our financial results during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
·   mtr gaming merger - the merger has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition of mtr gaming by holdco under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. our results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 reflect incremental increases in revenues and expenses attributable to the addition of the mtr gaming properties. additionally, we incurred costs associated with the merger totaling $7.4 million and $3.2 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.

33
·   circus reno/silver legacy purchase - pursuant to the purchase agreement, eri paid $80.2 million in cash, comprised of the $72.5 million purchase price plus $7.7 million in working capital adjustments and the assumption of the amounts outstanding under silver legacy's senior secured term loan facility. an additional $0.3 million was accrued as of acquisition date representing the final working capital adjustment. eri funded the purchase price for the acquisition and repaid the borrowings outstanding under the silver legacy credit faculty using a portion of the proceeds from the sale of its senior notes, borrowings under its revolving credit facility and cash on hand. information presented prior to the acquisition date does not reflect the results of operations for circus reno, and only includes our interest in the silver legacy joint venture prior to the acquisition as an investment in unconsolidated affiliate. as a result, incremental increases in revenues and expenses attributable to the addition of circus reno and silver legacy are reflected in our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2015. in conjunction with the acquisition, we incurred costs totaling $2.5 million and recorded a $35.6 million gain related to the valuation of our pre-acquisition investment in the silver legacy joint venture. we also expensed fees totaling $0.6 million, which are included in corporate costs, related to our equity offering initially intended to fund the acquisition. these fees were expensed as a result of our election to fund the final component of the acquisition with existing revolver capacity in lieu of an equity offering.

·   execution of cost savings program - we identified several areas to improve property level and consolidated margins through operating and cost efficiencies and exercising financial discipline throughout the company without impacting the player experience. in addition to cost savings relating to duplicative executive compensation, legal and accounting fees and other corporate expenses that we have eliminated as a result of the merger, we have achieved savings in marketing, food and beverage costs, selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating departments as a result of operating efficiencies and purchasing power of the combined mtr and eldorado organization. these cost savings were reflected in our operating results for the year ended december 31, 2015 and exceeded our projected $10 million annual target a full quarter ahead of plan. moreover, in addition to generating incremental revenues, we expect to realize savings resulting from cost synergies across the reno tri-properties in 2016 as a result of the recent acquisition.

·   refinancing and reduction in interest expense - in july 2015, we successfully refinanced all of our indebtedness, including the debt we assumed in the merger in 2014. we issued $375 million in senior notes and entered into a new $425 million term loan and a new $150 million revolving credit facility and applied the net proceeds to, among other things, purchase our resorts senior secured notes and mtr second lien notes. the refinancing reduced our annualized cash interest payments by $35 million. as a result of the july 2015 refinancing, we recognized a $1.9 million net loss on the early retirement of debt. see "liquidity and capital resources" for more information related to our recent refinancing.

·   income taxes - in 2015, the company recorded a $69.6 million net benefit for income taxes resulting from an adjustment to its valuation allowance. this adjustment was based on management's consideration of all evidence, including the positive impact of the company's recent refinancing and the acquisition, related to the realization of its federal deferred tax assets. as a result, net income increased significantly in 2015 compared to 2014. (see "income taxes" below).

·   west virginia smoking ban - on august 26, 2014, the board of health of hancock county, west virginia adopted and approved the clean air regulation act of 2014 ("regulation"), which became effective july 1, 2015. the regulation bans smoking in public places in hancock county including at mountaineer. to comply with the regulation upon its effective date, mountaineer built a 9,300 square foot smoking pavilion which opened on july 1, 2015 and currently houses 261 slot machines and six table games. notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate the impact of the smoking ban, the regulation has had a negative impact on our business and results of operations at mountaineer and we expect that it will continue to negatively impact our business and results of operations and that such impact may be material.

·   major bowling tournaments in the reno market - the national bowling stadium, located one block from the reno tri-properties is one of the largest bowling complexes in north america and has been selected to host multi‐month tournaments every year through 2018 except for 2017. it has also been selected to host ten united states bowling congress ("usbc") tournaments from 2019 through 2026. during this period, two of the ten usbc tournaments may be held in the same year. historically, these multi‐month bowling tournaments have attracted a significant number of visitors to the reno market and have benefited business in the downtown area, including the reno tri-properties. the usbc tournaments returned to reno in 2014 and brought approximately 62,000 bowlers to the reno area during the 2014 tournament period which began on february 28th and continued through july 12th. the usbc tournament attracted approximately 15,600 women bowlers to the reno market from march to july in 2015. this decline in bowler attendance resulted in lower hotel occupancy in the downtown reno market during the tournament period in comparison to the same prior year period. both tournaments return to reno in 2016 and are expected to attract approximately 38,000 bowlers beginning in march and continuing through july 10th.

·   property enhancement capital expenditures - we began to realize the benefits of our property enhancement initiatives that targeted product and service offering upgrades across our entire portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2015 as all of them were completed by year-end and helped drive increased volume to our properties. most notably, the opening of the brew brothers, our restaurant and microbrewery at scioto downs, provided a meaningful increase in traffic and slot revenues in 2015. additionally, we completed a $5.0 million five-phase design and facility enhancement program at presque isle downs that added a new casino center bar, an improved high limit gaming area and new slot product. in 2015, over 200 rooms were remodeled at eldorado reno and we completely refurbished the exterior of the eldorado shreveport.

·   competition - our results of operations over the past three years have been adversely impacted by the expansion of native american gaming and the expansion of gaming in our regional markets.

nevada. a significant portion of our revenues and operating income are generated from patrons who are residents of northern california, and as such, our operations have been adversely impacted by the growth in native american gaming in northern california. many existing native american gaming facilities in northern california are modest compared to the reno tri-properties. however, a number of native american tribes have established large‐scale gaming facilities in california and some native american tribes have announced that they are in the process of expanding, developing, or are considering establishing, large‐scale hotel and gaming facilities in northern california. as northern california native american gaming operations have expanded, we believe the increasing competition generated by these gaming operations has had a negative impact, principally on drive‐in, day‐trip visitor traffic from our main feeder markets in northern california. a 320,000 square foot gaming facility located in sonoma county, california opened on november 5, 2013.
louisiana. casino gaming is currently prohibited in several jurisdictions from which the shreveport/bossier city market draws customers, primarily texas. although casino gaming is currently not permitted in texas, the texas legislature has from time to time considered proposals to authorize casino gaming and there can be no assurance that casino gaming will not be approved in texas in the future, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. eldorado shreveport competes with several native american casinos located in oklahoma, certain of which are located near our core texas markets. because we draw a significant amount of our customers from the dallas/fort worth area, but are located approximately 190 miles from that area, we believe we will continue to face increased competition from gaming operations in oklahoma, including the winstar and choctaw casinos, and would face significant competition that may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations if casino gaming is approved in texas. in june 2013, construction was completed on a 30,000 square foot casino and 400‐room hotel in bossier city across the red river from eldorado shreveport. the facility, which also includes several restaurants and a 1,000‐seat entertainment arena, opened on june 15, 2013. in december 2014, a new luxury, land‐based casino with 1,600 slot machines, 72 gaming tables, a poker room, and a
35
740‐room hotel with a ballroom and spa, opened in lake charles, louisiana approximately 200 miles south of eldorado shreveport, but closer to the houston, texas market.
eastern. the mtr gaming properties experience varying competitive pressures, from casinos in western pennsylvania, western new york, northern west virginia and ohio. we believe the expansion of gaming in ohio, which includes casinos that opened in cleveland in may 2012 and columbus in october 2012 and additional casinos in cincinnati and toledo, as well as the installation of vlts at existing horse race tracks near cleveland, one of which opened in april 2013 and the other in december 2013 and the relocation of a racetrack to austintown, ohio, which opened in september 2014, has had and will continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations at all our properties and such impact may be material. in order to sustain our market share in the increased competitive environment, we continuously reevaluate our advertising strategies and promotional offers to our guests to ensure our reinvestment levels reflect the appropriate level of offerings to sustain our margins.
results of operations the following table highlights the results of our operations (dollars in thousands):

operating results. our net revenues increased 98.9% and 46.4% in 2015 and 2014, respectively, over the same prior year periods primarily due to incremental revenues, consisting primarily of casino revenues, attributable to the aforementioned merger and acquisition. improvements in revenues in louisiana and nevada also contributed to the increase in net revenues in 2015 compared to 2014. operating income increased 313.1% in 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of post-closing operating activity resulting from the merger and acquisition while operating income declined in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to costs associated with the merger combined with higher depreciation expense. net income increased 891.6% in 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of the same factors impacting operating income combined with a $35.6 million gain related to the valuation of the silver legacy joint venture in conjunction with the acquisition and the aforementioned $69.6 million in benefit for income taxes recorded in 2015. the decline in net income of 176.3% in 2014 compared to 2013 was due to the increase in interest expense associated with the merger, a decline in the gain on retirement of debt of unconsolidated affiliate and the establishment of a tax provision in 2014 resulting from the merger.

supplemental unaudited presentation of consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014
adjusted ebitda (defined below), a non gaap financial measure, has been presented as a supplemental disclosure because it is a widely used measure of performance and basis for valuation of companies in our industry and we believe that this non gaap supplemental information will be helpful in understanding the company's ongoing operating results. adjusted ebitda represents operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation, (gain) loss on the sale or disposal of property, equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates, acquisition charges, s-1 expenses and other regulatory gaming assessments, to the extent that such items existed in the periods presented. adjusted ebitda is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap, is unaudited and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance. uses of cash flows that are not reflected in adjusted ebitda include capital expenditures, interest payments, income taxes, debt principal repayments and certain regulatory gaming assessments, which can be significant. as a result, adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity. other companies that provide ebitda information may calculate ebitda differently than we do. the definition of adjusted ebitda may not be the same as the definitions used in any of our debt agreements.
the following table summarizes our net revenues and adjusted ebitda for our operating segments for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, in addition to reconciling adjusted ebitda to net income (loss) in accordance with u.s. gaap (unaudited, in thousands):

we expect that our primary capital requirements going forward will relate to the operation and maintenance of our properties and servicing our outstanding indebtedness. in 2016, we plan to spend $50.0 million, net of reimbursements from west virginia, on qualified capital expenditures, $46.8 million to pay interest on our senior notes and our new credit facility and $4.3 million for principal payments on our term loan. we expect that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital requirements and service our outstanding indebtedness for the foreseeable future; however, we cannot provide assurance that operating cash flows will be sufficient to do so.
eri is a holding company and its only significant assets are ownership interests in its subsidiaries. eri's ability to fund its obligations depends on the cash flow of its subsidiaries and the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute or otherwise make funds available to eri.
at december 31, 2015, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $83.5 million, including restricted cash of $5.3 million. at december 31, 2014, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $95.8 million, including restricted cash of $8.2 million.
operating cash flow. in 2015, we generated cash flows from operating activities of $56.7 million as compared to $31.6 million in 2014. the increase in operating cash was primarily due to the increase in net income during the current year associated with improvements in operations along with incremental cash flow associated with the merger and acquisition combined with various changes in the balance sheet accounts in the normal course of business.
investing cash flow. net cash flows used in investing activities totaled $158.8 million in 2015 and partially consisted of $35.5 million in capital expenditures, net of cash reimbursements in west virginia, for various renovation projects and equipment purchases. additionally, $125.0 million of net assets were acquired in the acquisition.
net cash flows provided in investing activities for 2014 primarily consisted of $40.4 million representing acquired cash associated with the merger. this increase was partially offset by $10.6 million in capital expenditures for various renovation projects and equipment purchases.
financing cash flow. net cash flows provided by financing activities in 2015 totaled $92.7 million consisting mainly of the proceeds and associated costs with the issuance of the senior notes and new credit facility and the retirement of the resorts senior secured notes and mtr second lien notes. subsequent to our refinancing transaction, we made payments of $2.1 million and $37.5 million under the new term loan and new revolving credit facility, respectively, in 2015. we had total borrowings of $131 million under the new revolving credit facility attributable to our refinancing and the acquisition in 2015.
net cash used for financing activities in 2014 totaled $14.2 million and partially consisted of payments totaling $2.5 million on the resorts credit facility, $0.6 million in distributions representing louisiana state tax payments and an increase in restricted cash of $3.2 million due to a decrease in funds related to horsemen's fines and simulcasting funds that are restricted to payments for improving horsemen's facilities and racing purse at scioto downs.
additionally, the repurchase of mtr gaming common stock totaled $5.0 million and represented the amount paid in cash by holdco upon closing of the merger in 2014. an additional $30.0 million of mtr gaming common stock was purchased by mtr gaming upon closing of the merger and was reflected as a reduction of the net cash acquired under investing activities. also during 2014, mtr gaming used $11.0 million to repurchase $10.0 million in aggregate principal amount of mtr senior lien notes at a price of $110.25 per $100 in principal amount of the purchased notes.

$1 for each $2 expended for certain qualifying capital expenditures having a useful life of more than three years and placed into service after july 1, 2011. qualifying capital expenditures include the purchase of slot machines and related equipment to the extent such slot machines are retained by mountaineer at its west virginia location for not less than five years. any unexpended balance from a given fiscal year will be available for one additional fiscal year, after which time the remaining unused balance carried forward will be forfeited. as of december 31, 2015, mountaineer remains eligible for $3.0 million under annual modernization fund grants that expire in varying dates through june 30, 2017. we can make no assurances mountaineer will be able to make qualifying capital expenditures purchases sufficient to receive reimbursement of the available funds prior to their expiration nor that the modernization funds will continue to be available.
we anticipate spending up to a total of $50 million on capital expenditures during 2016.
silver legacy joint venture loan and credit support ellc and galleon were each required to provide credit support by depositing $5.0 million of cash into bank accounts that were subject to a security interest in favor of the lender under the silver legacy credit agreement. in november 2015 in conjunction with the acquisition, the indebtedness under the silver legacy credit agreement was paid in full by eri and the credit support obligation was eliminated. debt obligations refinancing transaction and senior notes on july 23, 2015, the company issued $375 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.0% senior notes due 2023 pursuant to the indenture, dated as of july 23, 2015 (the "indenture"), at an issue price equal to 100.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes. the senior notes are guaranteed by all of the company's direct and indirect restricted subsidiaries other than immaterial subsidiaries, cc-reno, llc and the silver legacy joint venture. cc-reno, llc and the silver legacy joint venture will become guarantors upon receipt of the requisite gaming approvals. the senior notes will mature on august 1, 2023, with interest payable semi-annually in arrears on february 1 and august 1 of each year.

the credit agreement governing the new credit facility also includes requirements that the company maintain a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio (adjusting over time). the company is required to maintain a maximum total leverage ratio of 6.75 to 1.00 from the closing date through december 31, 2015, 6.00 to 1.00 from january 1, 2016 to december 31, 2017 and 5.00 to 1.00 thereafter. in addition, the company is required to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.50 to 1.00 from the closing date through december 31, 2015, and 2.75 to 1.00 from january 1, 2016 through december 31, 2016 and 3.00 to 1.00 thereafter. a default of the financial ratio covenants shall only become an event of default under the new term loan if the lenders providing the new revolving credit facility take certain affirmative actions after the occurrence of a default of such financial ratio covenants.
the credit agreement governing the new credit facility contains a number of customary events of default, including, among others, for the non-payment of principal, interest or other amounts, the inaccuracy of certain representations and warranties, the failure to perform or observe certain covenants, a cross default to other indebtedness including the senior notes, certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency; certain erisa events, the invalidity of certain loan documents, certain changes of control and the loss of certain classes of licenses to conduct gaming. if any event of default occurs, the lenders under the new credit facility would be entitled to take various actions, including accelerating amounts due thereunder and taking all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. as of december 31, 2015, the company was in compliance with the covenants under the new credit facility.

(1)   these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheets, which are included elsewhere in this report. see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our debt and related matters.

(2)   our operating lease obligations are described in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.

(3)   includes an annual table gaming license fee of $2.5 million for mountaineer which is due on july 1st of each year as long as mountaineer operates table games. includes our obligation for gaming taxes at presque isle downs, which is set at a minimum of $10.0 million per year, as required by the pennsylvania gaming control board. also includes our obligation at presque isle downs, as the holder of a category 1 license, to create a fund to be used for the improvement and maintenance of the backside area of the racetrack with an amount of not less than $250,000 or more than $1 million annually for a five-year period beginning in 2017.

(4)   pursuant to an agreement with the mountaineer park horsemen's benevolent and protective association, inc. and/or in accordance with the west virginia racing statute, mountaineer is required to utilize its best efforts to conduct racing for a minimum of 210 days and pay average daily minimum purses established by mountaineer prior to the first live racing date each year ($95,000 for 2015) for the term of the agreement which expires on december 31, 2018.

(5)   in connection with the 2003 purchase of scioto downs, certain shareholders of scioto downs elected the option to

45
receive cash and contingent earn‐out payments ("cep rights") in lieu of all cash for their outstanding shares of scioto downs' common stock. the triggering event occurred when scioto downs received its permanent vlt license in may 2012 and commenced gaming operations. as a result, we recorded a liability for the estimated ten year payout to the stockholders who elected to receive the cep rights. the future obligation was calculated based on scioto downs' projected ebitda for the ten calendar years beginning january 1, 2013.

(6)   these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheets, which are included elsewhere in this report. see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our regulatory gaming assessments.

the table above excludes certain commitments as of december 31, 2015, for which the timing of expenditures associated with such commitments is unknown, or contractual agreements have not been executed, or the guaranteed maximum price for such contractual agreements has not been agreed upon.
the repayment of our long‐term debt, which consists of indebtedness evidenced by the senior notes and the new credit facility is subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default under the indentures governing these obligations.
we routinely enter into operational contracts in the ordinary course of our business, including construction contracts for minor projects that are not material to our business or financial condition as a whole. our commitments relating to these contracts are recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets when services are provided with respect to such contracts.
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements.
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our revenues, results of operations or cash flows since inception.
other liquidity matters the pennsylvania gaming control board (the "pgcb"), the pennsylvania department of revenue and the pennsylvania state police (collectively "the borrowers"), were required to fund the costs they incurred in connection with the initial development of the infrastructure to support gaming operations in pennsylvania as well as the initial ongoing costs of the borrowers. the initial funding of these costs was provided from a loan from the pennsylvania general fund in the amount of $36.1 million, and further funding was provided from additional loans from the pennsylvania property tax reserve fund in the aggregate amount of $63.8 million.
the pennsylvania department of revenue will assess all licensees, including presque isle downs, their proportionate share of amounts represented by the borrowings, which are in the aggregate amount of $99.9 million, once the designated number of pennsylvania's slot machine licensees is operational. on july 11, 2011, the pgcb issued an administrative order which established that payments associated with the $63.8 million that was borrowed from the property tax reserve fund would commence on january 1, 2012. the repayment allocation between all current licensees is based upon equal weighting of (i) cumulative gross slot revenue since inception in relation to the combined cumulative gross slot revenue for all licensees and (ii) single year gross slot revenue (during the state's fiscal year ending june 30) in relation to the combined single year gross slot revenue for all licensees; and amounts paid each year will be adjusted annually based upon changes in the licensee's proportionate share of gross slot revenue. we have estimated that our total proportionate share of the aggregate $63.8 million to be assessed to the gaming facilities will be $4.1 million and will be paid quarterly over a ten‐year period, which began effective january 1, 2012. for the $36.1 million that was borrowed from the general fund, payment is scheduled to begin after all fourteen licensees are operational. although we cannot determine when payment will begin, we have considered a similar repayment model for the general fund
46
borrowings and estimated that our total proportionate share of the aggregate $36.1 million to all fourteen gaming facilities will be $2.1 million.
the recorded estimate is subject to revision based upon future changes in the revenue assumptions utilized to develop the estimate. our estimated total obligation at december 31, 2015 is $4.3 million. the company paid $0.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2015.
we are faced with certain contingencies involving litigation and environmental remediation and compliance. these commitments and contingencies are discussed in greater detail in "part i, item 3. legal proceedings" and note 16 to our consolidated financial statements, both of which are included elsewhere in this report. in addition, new competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, and could have a similar adverse effect on our liquidity. see "part i, item 1a. risk factors-risks related to our business" which is included elsewhere in this report.
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, which is included elsewhere in this report. these policies, along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by our management in their application, have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ from our estimates. business combinations the company applied the provisions of accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 805, "business combinations", in the accounting for the circus reno/silver legacy purchase and the merger. it required us to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. goodwill as of the acquisition date was measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. while we used our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates were inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. as a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. upon the final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed any subsequent adjustments will be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations.
accounting for business combinations required our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, including our estimate of intangible assets, such as gaming licenses, trade names and loyalty programs. although we believe the assumptions and estimates made have been reasonable and appropriate, they are inherently uncertain. for our gaming license valuation, our properties estimated future cash flows were the primary assumption in the respective intangible valuations. cash flow estimates included assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance, net win per unit (revenue), patron visits and growth percentages. the growth percentages were developed considering general macroeconomic conditions as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition through a review of customer market data, operating margins, and current regulatory, social and economic climates. the most significant of the assumptions used in the valuations included: (1) revenue growth/decline percentages; (2) discount rates; (3) effective income tax rates; (4) future terminal values and (5) capital expenditure assumptions. these assumptions were developed for each of our properties based on historical trends in the current competitive markets in which they operate, and projections of future performance and competition. the primary assumptions with respect to our trade names and loyalty program intangibles primary assumptions were selecting the appropriate royalty rates and cost estimates for replacement cost analyses.
in addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the business combination date. the company reevaluated these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the business combination date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance's or contingency's estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for
47
income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have material impact on our results of operations and financial position.
accounting for unconsolidated affiliates the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries. investments in unconsolidated affiliates which are 50% or less owned and do not meet the consolidation criteria of asc 810, "consolidation" are accounted for under the equity method. all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. certain amendments of asc 810 became effective for us beginning january 1, 2010. such amendments include changes to the quantitative approach to determine the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ("vie"). an enterprise must determine if its variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a vie by evaluating whether 1) the enterprise has the power to direct activities of the vie that have a significant effect on economic performance, and 2) the enterprise has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie. the amendments to asc 810 also require ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie. the company believes the adoption of these amendments did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
the company considers whether the fair values of any of its equity method investments have declined below their carrying value whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that recorded values may not be recoverable. if the company considers any such decline to be other than temporary, then a write‐down would be recorded to the estimated fair value. estimated fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results of the investee and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rate.
revenue recognition gaming revenues consist of the net win from gaming activities, which is the difference between amounts wagered and amounts paid to winning patrons, and is recognized at the time wagers are made net of winning payouts to patrons. base and progressive jackpots are accrued and charged to revenue at the time the obligation to pay the jackpot is established. pari‐mutuel commissions consist of commissions earned from thoroughbred and harness racing, and importing of simulcast signals from other race tracks. pari‐mutuel commissions are recognized at the time wagers are made. such commissions are a designated portion of the wagering handle as determined by state racing commissions, and are shown net of the taxes assessed by state and local agencies, as well as purses and other contractual amounts paid to horsemen associations. we recognize revenues from fees earned through the exporting of simulcast signals to other race tracks at the time wagers are made. such fees are based upon a predetermined percentage of handle as contracted with the other race tracks. revenues from food and beverage are recognized at the time of sale and revenues from lodging are recognized on the date of stay. other revenues are recorded at the time services are rendered or merchandise sold. we offer certain promotional allowances to our customers, including complimentary lodging, food and beverage, and promotional credits for free play on slot machines. the retail value of these promotional items is shown as a reduction in total revenues on our consolidated statements of operations. income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file us federal income tax returns and various state and local income tax returns. the company does not have tax sharing agreements with the other members within the consolidated eri group. with few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to us federal or state and local tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2012.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, the difference between the effective rate and the statutory rate is attributed primarily to the federal and state valuation allowances on the company's deferred tax assets. as a result of the company's net operating losses and net deferred tax asset position as of december 31, 2014 (after exclusion of certain deferred tax liabilities that generally cannot be offset against deferred tax assets, known as "naked credits"), the company provided for a full valuation allowance against substantially all of the net federal and the net state deferred tax assets.
48
for the year ended december 31, 2015, the difference between the effective rate and the statutory rate is attributable primarily to the release of a majority of the federal and related state valuation allowances on the company's deferred tax assets.  the company continues to provide for a valuation allowance against net federal and state deferred tax assets associated with non-operating land, the sale of which could result in capital losses that can only be offset against capital gains. the company also continues to provide for a valuation allowance against net state deferred tax assets relating to operations in pennsylvania and west virginia. management determined it was not more-likely-than-not that the company will realize these net deferred tax assets.
a valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. management must analyze all available positive and negative evidence regarding realization of the deferred tax assets and make an assessment of the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income. for the year ended december 31, 2014, the company was in a three-year cumulative loss position, which was significant negative evidence, and the company did not have positive evidence to outweigh the negative evidence.  for the year ended december 31, 2015, management has considered all available positive and negative evidence and concluded it is more-likely-than-not to realize its federal, louisiana and city of columbus, ohio deferred tax assets, with the exception of non-operating land. the company will continue to evaluate the realization of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and make adjustments to its valuation allowance as appropriate.
for income tax purposes the company amortizes or depreciates certain assets that have been assigned an indefinite life for book purposes. for the year ended december 31, 2014, the incremental amortization or depreciation deductions for income tax purposes resulted in an increase in certain deferred tax liabilities that could not be used as a source of future taxable income for purposes of measuring the company's need for a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets. therefore, the company recorded non‐cash deferred tax expense of $1.1 million as the company amortized these assets for tax purposes.
prior to the merger date, holdco was taxed as a partnership under the internal revenue code pursuant to which income taxes were primarily the responsibility of the partners. the company is a c corporation subject to the federal and state corporate‐level income taxes at prevailing corporate tax rates. while taxed as a partnership, holdco was not subject to federal income tax liability. because holders of membership interests in holdco were required to include their respective shares of holdco's taxable income (including that of resorts) in their individual income tax returns, distributions were made to their respective member(s) to cover such tax liabilities. such distributions were subject to limitation in accordance with the provisions of their respective operating agreements. eldorado shreveport #2, llc has elected as a single member limited liability company to be taxed as a c corporation. current and deferred income taxes associated with eldorado shreveport #2, llc were not material.
under the applicable accounting standards, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more‐likely‐than‐not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the accounting standards also provide guidance on de‐recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions. we have recorded no liability associated with uncertain tax positions at december 31, 2015 and 2014.
property and equipment and other long‐lived assets property and equipment is recorded at cost, except for the silver legacy, circus reno and the mtr gaming properties, which were adjusted for fair value under asc 805 and are depreciated over their remaining estimated useful life or lease term. judgments are made in determining estimated useful lives and salvage values of these assets. the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and whether we have a gain or loss on the disposal of assets. we review depreciation estimates and methods as new events occur, more experience is acquired, and additional information is obtained that would possibly change our current estimates.
property, equipment and other long‐lived assets are assessed for impairment in accordance with asc 360-property, plant, and equipment. the company evaluates its long‐lived assets periodically for impairment issues or,
49
more frequently, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the net carrying value to the sum of the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets. the amount of impairment loss, if any, is measured by the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset which is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model (level 3 of the fair value hierarchy). for assets to be disposed of, impairment is recognized based on the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. based on the results of our periodic reviews we have not recorded any impairment losses during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
for undeveloped properties, including non‐operating real properties, when indicators of impairment are present, properties are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset or market comparisons are less than the asset's carrying amount. the amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value, which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, management estimates or market comparisons. the fair value measurements employed for our impairment evaluations, which are subject to the assumptions and factors as previously discussed, were generally based on a review of comparable activities in the marketplace, which falls within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
goodwill and other indefinite‐lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business. intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based upon their fair value at the date of acquisition. goodwill and other indefinite‐lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually, during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired.
goodwill is tested by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value. the company estimates the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing income and market approaches. the income approach is based on projected future cash flow that is discounted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows. the market approach is based on the company's market capitalization at the testing date. the aggregate carrying value of the company's goodwill was $66.8 million as of december 31, 2015. the company did not have goodwill prior to the merger date.
our indefinite‐lived intangible assets consist of racing and gaming licenses, trade names and loyalty programs and are evaluated for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. any excess of carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment within the consolidated statement of operations in the period of review.
the gaming and racing licenses of each property were valued in aggregate for each respective property, as these licenses are considered to be the most significant asset of the properties and the gaming licenses could not be obtained without holding the racing licenses. therefore, a market participant would consider the licenses in aggregate. the fair value of the licenses is calculated using an excess earnings methodology, which is an income approach methodology that allocates the projected cash flows of the property to the gaming license intangible assets less charges for the use of the other identifiable assets of the property, including working capital, fixed assets, and other intangible assets. we believe this methodology is appropriate as the gaming licenses are the primary asset to the properties, the licenses are linked to each respective facility and it's the lowest level at which discrete cash flows can be directly attributable to the assets. under the gaming legislation applicable to our properties, licenses are property specific and can only be acquired if a buyer acquires the existing facility. because existing licenses may not be acquired and transferred for use at a different facility, the estimated future cash flows of each of our properties was the primary assumption in the valuation of such property. the aggregate carrying value of the company's gaming license intangibles approximated $482.1 million as of december 31, 2015.
assessing the indefinite‐lived intangible assets for impairment is a process that requires significant judgment and involves detailed quantitative and qualitative business‐specific analysis and many individual assumptions which fluctuate between assessments. our properties' estimated future cash flows are a primary assumption in the respective impairment analyses. unforeseen events, changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in
50
estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge, which could be material. cash flow estimates include assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance, net win per unit (revenue), patron visits, growth percentages which are developed considering general macroeconomic conditions as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition through a review of customer market data, operating margins, and current regulatory, social and economic climates. these estimates could also be negatively impacted by changes in federal, state, or local regulations, economic downturns or developments and other market conditions affecting travel and access to the properties. the most significant of the assumptions used in our valuations include: (1) revenue growth/decline percentages; (2) discount rates; (3) effective income tax rates; (4) future terminal values and (5) capital expenditure assumptions. these assumptions were developed for each property based on historical trends, the current competitive markets in which they operate, and projections of future performance and competition.
the company values trade names using the relief‐from‐royalty method. royalty rates range from 0.5% ‐ 1.0%. the loyalty program was valued using a combination of a replacement cost and lost profits analysis. trade names are amortized on a straight‐line basis over a 3.5 year useful life and the loyalty program is being amortized on a straight‐line basis over a one year useful life. the aggregate carrying value of trade names and loyalty program intangibles as of december 31, 2015 was $9.8 million and $7.7 million, respectively.
we believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our other indefinite‐lived intangible assets; however, these estimates and assumptions could be materially different from actual results. if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected, or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of our licensing intangibles below the carrying value reflected on the consolidated balance sheet, we may be required to conduct an interim test or possibly recognize impairment charges, which may be material, in future periods.
no impairment charges were recorded for our other indefinite‐lived intangible assets in any of the years presented.
reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable we reserve an estimated amount for receivables that may not be collected. methodologies for estimating bad debt reserves range from specific reserves to various percentages applied to aged receivables. historical collection rates are considered, as are customer relationships, in determining specific reserves. as with many estimates, management must make judgments about potential actions by third parties in establishing and evaluating our reserves for bad debts.
self‐insurance reserves the company is self‐insured for various levels of general liability, employee medical insurance coverage and workers' compensation coverage. self‐insurance reserves are estimated based on the company's claims experience and are included in accrued other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. at december 31, 2015 and 2014, accrued insurance and medical claims reserves were $3.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively.
loyalty program we offer programs whereby our participating patrons can accumulate points for wagering that can be redeemed for credits for free play on slot machines, lodging, food and beverage, merchandise and in limited situations, cash. based upon the estimated redemptions of loyalty program points, an estimated liability is established for the cost of redemption on earned but unredeemed points. the estimated cost of redemption utilizes estimates and assumptions of the mix of the various product offerings for which the points will be redeemed and costs of such product offerings. changes in the programs, membership levels and redemption patterns of our participating patrons can impact this liability. the aggregate outstanding liability for the loyalty program was $3.4 million and $2.4 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and is included as a component of other accrued liabilities in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
51
litigation, claims and assessments we utilize estimates for litigation, claims and assessments. these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events, as well as assumptions about future events. if our assessment of such a matter should change, we may have to change the estimates, which may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. actual results could differ from these estimates. recently issued accounting pronouncements in february 2016, the fasb issued an accounting standards update which addresses the recognition and measurement of leases. under the new guidance, for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases), at the commencement date, lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis, and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. further, the new lease guidance simplifies the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and liabilities, which no longer provides a source for off balance sheet financing. the effective date for this update is for the annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. lessees and lessors must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this accounting standard on our consolidated financial statements.
in november 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-17, "income taxes-balance sheet classification of deferred taxes", which eliminates the guidance in topic 740, income taxes, that required an entity to separate deferred tax liabilities and assets between current and noncurrent amounts in a classified balance sheet. the amendment require that all deferred tax liabilities and assets of the same tax jurisdiction or a tax filing group, as well as any related valuation allowance, be offset and presented as a single noncurrent amount in a classified balance sheet. the amendment is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016. early application is permitted. the guidance may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. the company applied this guidance in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with prospective application effective october 1, 2015.
in september 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-16, business combinations (topic 805): simplifying the accounting for measurement-period adjustments. asu 2015-16 eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. instead, an acquirer will recognize a measurement-period adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment. the guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. for all other entities, it is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2016. we are evaluating the effects, if any, that the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.
in july 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-11, "simplifying the measurement of inventory", which requires that inventory within the scope of asu 2015-11 be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. inventory measured using last-in, first-out (lifo) and the retail inventory method are not impacted by the new guidance. asu 2015-11 applies to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out (fifo) or average cost. an entity should measure inventory within the scope of asu 2015-11 at the lower of cost and net realizable value. net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. asu 2015-11 is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016. early adoption is permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact on our financial statements and disclosures.
in april 2015, the fasb issued an accounting standards update which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. under the new standard, an entity presents such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. the amortization of the costs is reported as interest expense. in august 2015, the fasb issued an accounting standards update which clarifies that companies may continue

to present unamortized debt issuance costs associated with line of credit arrangements as an asset. the new guidance should be applied on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period should be adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. the effective dates for these updates were for the annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2015. we elected to early adopt this guidance during the third quarter of 2015.
in january 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015‐1, "income statement-extraordinary and unusual items" (subtopic 225‐20) which eliminates the concept of accounting of extraordinary items, previously defined as items that are both unusual and infrequent, which were reported as a separate item on the income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations. the elimination of this concept is intended to simplify accounting for unusual items and more closely align with international accounting practices. this amendment is effective for annual periods ending after december 15, 2015 and for subsequent interim and annual periods thereafter. early adoption is permitted. we believe that the effects, if any, of the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in august 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014‐15, "presentation of financial statements-going concern" (subtopic 205‐40) which amends the current guidance in asc topic 205 by adding subtopic 40. subtopic 40 requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that in aggregate would raise substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial statements are issued or available to be issued. if substantial doubt existed, management would be required to make certain disclosures related to nature of the substantial doubt and under certain circumstances, how that substantial doubt would be mitigated. this amendment is effective for annual periods ending after december 15, 2016 and for subsequent interim and annual periods thereafter. early adoption is permitted. we are currently evaluating the effects, if any, adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.
in june 2014, the fasb issued an accounting standards update with respect to performance share awards. this accounting standards update requires that a performance target that affects vesting, and that could be achieved after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition. as such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair value of the award. this update further clarifies that compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period or periods for which the requisite service has already been rendered. the effective date for this update is for the annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2015. early adoption is permitted. we do not believe that the adoption of this accounting standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in may 2014, the fasb issued accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2014‐9, "revenue from contracts with customers", which provides guidance for revenue recognition. the new standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry‐specific guidance. the core principle of the revenue model is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. the standard is designed to create greater comparability for financial statement users across industries and jurisdictions and also requires enhanced disclosures. the guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is permitted for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2016. we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu 2014‐09 on our consolidated financial statements.

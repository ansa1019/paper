item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes. certain amounts in the 2014 and 2013 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2015 presentation. additionally, as more fully described in note 2 of the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report, due to accounting errors in prior periods, certain amounts in the 2014 and 2013 consolidated financial statements have been revised.
on june 24, 2015, we completed our merger with biomet and its results of operations have been included in our results starting on that date. the biomet merger is a transformational event for us and has had significant effects on all aspects of our business. accordingly, our revenues and expenses increased significantly in the year ended december 31, 2015.
in portions of this discussion and analysis, we also present sales information on an unaudited, pro forma basis for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014. this pro forma information includes zimmer and biomet sales in those periods as if the merger occurred on january 1, 2014. accordingly, the pro forma net sales information for periods prior to the closing date includes the net sales of biomet, but does not include the impact of the divestiture of certain product line rights and assets. we believe this pro forma analysis is beneficial for investors because it represents how the merged companies may have performed on a combined basis in 2015 and 2014. such pro forma net sales information may not be indicative, however, of future operating performance.
executive level overview
2015 results the last half of 2015 was significantly affected by our biomet integration activities. we made significant progress by accomplishing important commercial integration milestones across all geographies. we largely completed the appointment of our global sales leaders. we also began to execute our integration roadmaps designed to capture the net operating synergy opportunities presented by this merger.
our results have been significantly impacted by the biomet merger. our sales for 2015 increased by 28.3 percent primarily due to the biomet merger. volume/mix growth from the merger was partially offset by the negative effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and continued, but stable, pricing pressure in all of our geographic regions.
our net earnings decreased in 2015 compared to 2014. the primary driver of the lower net earnings was expense incurred in connection with the biomet merger. as a result of the merger, we recognized significant expenses due to stepping up the acquired inventory to fair value, intangible asset amortization, the acceleration of the vesting of unvested lvb stock options and lvb stock-based awards, retention bonuses paid to biomet employees and third-party sales agents who remained with biomet through the closing date, severance expense, contract termination expense related to agreements with independent agents, distributors, suppliers and lessors, a loss related to a call premium on biomet debt we redeemed, third party fees, and other acquisition and integration charges. interest expense also increased due to financing-related costs for the merger.
2016 outlook we expect our sales in the first half of 2016 to be higher than in the first half of 2015, on a reported basis, since the biomet merger was completed midway through 2015. on a pro forma basis, we expect revenues to be approximately flat in 2016 compared to 2015. this estimate assumes foreign currency exchange rates will decrease revenues by approximately 2 percent, continued pricing pressure will decrease revenues by approximately 2 percent, and our volume/mix growth will be approximately 4 percent. we expect pro forma sales growth will improve in the last half of the year compared to the first half as our sales force stabilizes, we take advantage of cross-selling opportunities and we anniversary out of many sales force dissynergies caused by the merger.
we expect cost of products sold to continue to realize significant expense related to stepping up acquired biomet inventory to fair value. similarly, our intangible asset amortization expense will increase significantly as we recognize a full year of intangible asset amortization from the biomet merger. we expect research and development (r&d) expense for the year to be in a range of 4.5 to 5.0 percent of sales. selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expense is expected to approximate 37 percent of sales, which is an improvement from 2015 as we realize synergies from the merger. we estimate special items expense will continue to be significant as we continue our integration activities. however, we expect special items expense will be less in 2016 compared to 2015 due to the significant, initial expenses incurred in 2015 for the integration. interest expense will increase in 2016 compared to 2015 due to the debt borrowed in 2015 to fund the biomet merger.
results of operations we analyze sales by three geographies, the americas, emea and asia pacific, and by the following product

zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2015 form 10-k annual report categories: knees, hips, s.e.t., dental, spine & cmf and other. this sales analysis differs from our reportable operating segments, which are based upon our senior management organizational structure and how we allocate resources towards achieving operating profit goals. we analyze sales by geography because the underlying market trends in any particular geography tend to be similar across product categories and because we primarily sell the same products in all geographies.

demand (volume and mix) trends increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 36.7 percentage points of year-over-year sales growth during 2015. volume/mix growth was driven by the biomet merger, new product introductions and sales in key emerging markets.
we believe long-term indicators point toward sustained growth driven by an aging global population, growth in emerging markets, obesity, proven clinical benefits, new material technologies, advances in surgical techniques and more active lifestyles, among other factors. in addition, demand for clinically proven premium products and patient specific devices are expected to continue to positively affect sales growth in markets that recognize the value of these advanced technologies.
pricing trends global selling prices had a negative effect of 2.0 percentage points on year-over-year sales during 2015. the negative 2.0 percent effect on year-over-year sales is consistent with what we have experienced over the past three years. the majority of countries in which we operate continued to experience pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems.
foreign currency exchange rates in 2015, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negative effect of 6.4 percentage points on year-over-year sales. we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of forward contracts and foreign currency options solely to manage foreign currency volatility and risk. changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth, but due to offsetting gains/losses on hedge contracts and options, which are recorded in cost of products sold, the effect on net earnings in the near term is reduced.

dental dental sales increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the biomet merger. on a pro forma basis, sales in 2015 declined partly due to a supply disruption related to a voluntary field action in response to a packaging issue and the negative effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we are in the process of remediating the supply disruption and we expect to do so fully by the close of the first quarter of 2016.
spine & cmf spine and cmf sales increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the biomet merger. on a pro forma basis, strong sales of our cmf products were offset by a decline in spine product sales.

the decrease in gross margin percentage in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to increased inventory step-up costs as well as increased intangible asset amortization from the biomet merger. the decline was also a result of lower average selling prices and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges. these unfavorable items were partially offset by higher hedge gains in 2015 from our foreign currency hedging program compared to 2014. under the hedging program, for derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows, the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged items affect earnings. further, we experienced improved product category and geographic mix, resulting in lower average costs per unit sold as a percentage of sales.
in 2014, we experienced an increase in gross margin percentage compared to 2013, primarily due to significant excess and obsolete inventory charges related to products we
26
zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2015 form 10-k annual report intend to discontinue. we also recognized higher hedge gains in 2014 from our foreign currency hedging program compared to 2013.
operating expenses r&d expenses and r&d as a percentage of sales increased in 2015 compared to 2014. the primary driver of the increased expense was the biomet merger. the combination of our r&d functions subsequent to the merger will allow us to allocate a greater portion of the combined r&d spending towards innovation efforts to address unmet clinical needs and create new-market adjacencies. additionally, most of our r&d activities occur in the u.s., so expenses do not decrease proportionally to changes in net sales when there are significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which contributes to an increase in r&d as a percentage of sales. the increase in 2015 reverses a trend of declines in r&d expense and r&d as a percentage of sales. in prior years, the lower spending reflected a natural decline from certain large projects that achieved commercialization, including persona the personalized knee system, and a dedication of resources to our quality and operational excellence initiatives. we expect r&d spending in 2016 to increase and be between 4.5 and 5.0 percent of sales.
sg&a as a percentage of sales increased in 2015 compared to 2014 after realizing improvements in 2014 and 2013 due to our operational excellence initiatives. the biomet merger was the primary cause of the increase. we expect that sg&a as a percentage of sales will continue to be higher than prior to the biomet merger until we can realize synergy benefits of the merger. additionally, a significant portion of our sg&a expenses occur in the u.s., so expenses do not decrease proportionally to changes in net sales when there are significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
certain claims expense is for estimated liabilities to durom cup patients undergoing revision surgeries. we recorded additional expense of $7.7 million in 2015 for durom cup-related claims. since 2008, we have recognized $479.4 million for these claims. for more information regarding these claims, see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
special items have increased significantly in the past three years. the increases in 2015 were due to biomet merger-related expenses such as the acceleration of unvested lvb stock options and lvb stock-based awards, retention bonuses paid to biomet employees and third-party sales agents who remained with biomet through the closing date, severance expense and contract terminations. special items expense also includes our quality and operational excellence initiatives, which are intended to improve our future operating results by centralizing or outsourcing certain functions and improving quality, distribution, sourcing, manufacturing and our information technology systems. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding special items charges.
other expense, interest income, interest expense, and income taxes other expense, net, represents debt issuance costs that we recognized for the bridge credit agreement that we entered into in may 2014 in connection with the biomet merger, the net expense related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency other than an entitys functional currency offset by foreign currency forward exchange contracts we enter into to mitigate any gain or loss, and the call premium expense we recognized when we repaid biomets senior notes, partially offset by a gain related to selling certain product line rights and assets. the decrease in other expense, net in 2015 compared to 2014, was driven by fewer months of debt issuance costs from the bridge credit agreement and the gains recognized on the sale of the product line rights and assets.
net interest expense increased in 2015 due to the issuance of the debt in connection with the biomet merger.
our effective tax rate (etr) on earnings before income taxes for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was 4.6 percent, 23.4 percent and 22.8 percent, respectively. special items expense has significantly affected our etr as such expenses have generally been incurred within jurisdictions with higher tax rates, resulting in lower taxable income in these higher tax jurisdictions. the low 2015 tax rate results from operating losses in the u.s. caused by significant expenses incurred in connection with the merger. the u.s. has a higher tax rate compared to the majority of foreign operations where we realized operating income. we expect special items, the outcome of various federal, state and foreign audits, as well as expiration of certain statutes of limitations, to impact our etr in future years. currently, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of these items on our financial results.
segment operating profit similar to our consolidated results, our segment operating profit has been significantly impacted by the addition of biomet sales and expenses to these segments. in the americas, operating profit as a percentage of sales increased in 2015 compared to 2014, as we started to realize synergies of the merger. in emea, operating profit as a percentage of sales declined in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the increased biomet expenses. this decline is expected to continue until we can realize the synergy benefits of the merger in this region. in the asia pacific segment, operating profit as a percentage of sales increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and our hedging program.
non-gaap operating performance measures we use financial measures that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) to evaluate our operating performance. these non-gaap financial measures exclude the impact of inventory step-up, certain other inventory and manufacturing related charges connected to quality enhancement and remediation efforts, certain claims, intangible asset amortization, special items, other expenses related to financing obtained for the biomet merger, other expenses related to the call premium expense recognized to redeem the assumed biomet senior notes, the interest expense incurred on issued debt during the period prior to the consummation of the biomet merger and any related effects on

zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2015 form 10-k annual report our income tax provision associated with these items and other certain tax adjustments. we use this information internally and believe it is helpful to investors because it provides useful period-to-period comparisons of our ongoing operating results, it helps to perform trend analysis and to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items, and it provides additional transparency of certain items. certain of these non-gaap financial measures are used as metrics for our incentive compensation programs.
our non-gaap adjusted net earnings used for internal management purposes for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $1,310.5 million, $1,098.0 million, and $1,069.0 million, respectively, and our non-gaap adjusted diluted earnings per share were $6.90, $6.40, and $6.22, respectively.

liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities declined to $816.7 million in 2015, compared to $1,052.8 million in 2014. the decreased cash flows provided by operating activities in 2015 were primarily due to higher expenses related to the biomet merger, a $97.6 million loss on our forward starting interest rate swaps we settled in march 2015 when we issued senior notes for the biomet merger and inventory investments. these unfavorable items were partially offset by lower tax payments and the receipt of insurance proceeds related to durom cup product liability claims in the 2015 period. in 2014, we made significant tax payments for certain unresolved matters in order to limit the potential impact of irs interest charges. in 2016, we estimate operating cash flows to be in a range of $1,650.0 million to $1,750.0 million, inclusive of approximately $290.0 million of outflows related to integration expenses to drive synergies.
cash flows used in investing activities were $7,557.9 million in 2015 compared to $469.4 million in 2014. the primary investing activity in 2015 was the biomet merger. we continued to invest in instruments for significant product launches, such as persona the personalized knee system, as we deploy that system around the world. in 2016, we expect instrument investments to be in a range of $300.0 million to $325.0 million in support of our cross-sell initiatives as well as new product introductions. in 2015, we continued to invest in other property, plant and equipment at levels necessary to complete new product-related investments and to replace older machinery and equipment. in 2016, we expect to spend approximately $250.0 million on property, plant and equipment, including $105.0 million necessary to rationalize facilities and it systems as well as to optimize our manufacturing and logistics network.
cash flows provided by financing activities were $7,139.8 million in 2015, compared to a use of cash of $562.4 million in 2014. we issued debt in 2015 for the biomet merger, which resulted in proceeds and related debt issuance costs. we also repaid biomets senior notes that we assumed in the merger. additionally, with an increase in our stock price throughout 2014, many employees exercised stock options in the prior year. accordingly, there were fewer stock options outstanding at the end of 2014, leading to fewer option exercises in 2015 compared to 2014.
in february, may, july and december 2015, our board of directors declared cash dividends of $0.22 per share. we expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future dividends are subject to approval of the board of directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. as further discussed below, our debt facilities restrict the payment of dividends in certain circumstances.
as of december 31, 2015, $449.5 million remained authorized under our $1.0 billion share repurchase program, which has no expiration date. in anticipation of the merger with biomet, we suspended repurchases after the first quarter of 2014. we commenced share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2015 and continued repurchases in the first two months of 2016.

zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2015 form 10-k annual report through february 25, 2016, we repurchased approximately $415.0 million of shares of our common stock, which includes the $250.0 million of shares that we repurchased from certain selling stockholders on february 10, 2016.
in order to achieve operational synergies, we expect cash outlays related to our integration plans to be approximately $290.0 million in 2016. these cash outlays are necessary to achieve our integration goals of net annual pre-tax operating profit synergies of $350.0 million by the end of the third year post-closing date.
also as discussed in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements, as of december 31, 2015, a short-term liability of $50.0 million and long-term liability of $264.6 million related to durom cup product liability claims was recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. we expect to continue paying these claims over the next few years. we expect to be reimbursed a portion of these payments for product liability claims from insurance carriers. as of december 31, 2015, we have received a portion of the insurance proceeds we estimate we will recover. we have a long-term receivable of $95.3 million remaining for future expected reimbursements from our insurance carriers. we also had a short-term liability of $33.4 million related to biomet metal-on-metal hip implant claims.
at december 31, 2015, we had ten tranches of senior notes outstanding as follows (dollars in millions):
principal      interest       maturity date rate
$500.0         1.450   %   april 1, 2017

1,250.0         4.450       august 15, 2045
we issued $7.65 billion of senior notes in march 2015 (the merger notes), the proceeds of which were used to finance a portion of the cash consideration payable in the biomet merger, pay merger related fees and expenses and pay a portion of biomets funded debt. on june 24, 2015, we also borrowed $3.0 billion on a u.s. term loan (u.s. term loan) to fund the biomet merger.
we may, at our option, redeem our senior notes, in whole or in part, at any time upon payment of the principal, any applicable make-whole premium, and accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. in addition, the merger notes and the 3.375% senior notes due 2021 may be redeemed at our option without any make-whole premium at specified dates ranging from one month to six months in advance of the scheduled maturity date.
we have a $4.35 billion credit agreement (credit agreement) that contains: (i) a 5-year unsecured u.s. term loan facility (u.s. term loan facility) in the principal amount of $3.0 billion, and (ii) a 5-year unsecured multicurrency revolving facility (multicurrency revolving facility) in the principal amount of $1.35 billion. the multicurrency revolving facility will mature in may 2019, with two one-year extensions available at our option. borrowings under the multicurrency revolving facility may be used for general corporate purposes. there were no borrowings outstanding under the multicurrency revolving facility as of december 31, 2015. the u.s. term loan facility will mature in june 2020, with principal payments due beginning september 30, 2015, as follows: $75.0 million on a quarterly basis during the first three years, $112.5 million on a quarterly basis during the fourth year, and $412.5 million on a quarterly basis during the fifth year. in 2015, we paid $500.0 million in principal under the u.s. term loan facility, resulting in $2.5 billion in outstanding borrowings as of december 31, 2015.
we and certain of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries are the borrowers under the credit agreement. borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at floating rates based upon indices determined by the currency of the borrowings plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured long-term credit rating, or at an alternate base rate, or, in the case of borrowings under the multicurrency revolving facility only, at a fixed rate determined through a competitive bid process. the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement, including, among other things, limitations on consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. financial covenants include a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda ratio of no greater than 5.0 to 1.0 through june 24, 2016 and no greater than 4.5 to 1.0 thereafter. if our credit rating falls below investment grade, additional restrictions would result, including restrictions on investments and payment of dividends. we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement as of december 31, 2015.
commitments under the credit agreement are subject to certain fees. on the multicurrency revolving facility, we pay a facility fee at a rate determined by reference to our senior unsecured long-term credit rating.
we have a japan term loan agreement with one of the lenders under the credit agreement for 11.7 billion japanese yen that will mature on may 31, 2018. borrowings under the japan term loan bear interest at a fixed rate of 0.61 percent per annum until maturity.
we also have other available uncommitted credit facilities totaling $35.8 million.
we place our cash and cash equivalents in highly-rated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity. we invest only in high-quality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy.
as of december 31, 2015, we had short-term and long-term investments in debt securities with a fair value of $273.1 million. these investments are in debt securities of many different issuers and, therefore, we believe we have no significant concentration of risk with a single issuer. all of these debt securities remain highly rated and we believe the risk of default by the issuers is low.
29
zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2015 form 10-k annual report as of december 31, 2015, $921.9 million of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments were held in jurisdictions outside of the u.s. of this amount, $564.7 million is denominated in u.s. dollars and, therefore, bears no foreign currency translation risk. the balance of these assets is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate.
in light of our commitments under various credit facilities, as well as our expectation for continued business development, we have plans to repatriate a significant portion of our offshore earnings to the u.s. in particular, as a result of the biomet merger we have unremitted foreign earnings of $4,387.9 million which we plan to repatriate to the u.s. in future periods. we have recorded a long-term liability of $1,494.9 million for the estimated tax impact of this repatriation.
management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the multicurrency revolving facility are sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service needs, as well as return cash to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. should additional investment opportunities arise, we believe that our earnings, balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital, if necessary.
contractual obligations we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments. the following table illustrates our contractual obligations (in millions):
contractual                              total            2016          2017          2019              2021
obligations                                                         and 2018      and 2020               and thereafter long-term debt                       $11,551.4              $      $2,263.9      $3,987.5          $5,300.0
interest payments                      4,142.6           339.8         651.0         531.1           2,620.7

purchase obligations                      91.0            61.9          22.5           3.7               2.9
other long-term liabilities              406.7                        136.9         107.6             162.2
total contractual obligations        $16,423.5          $460.8      $3,152.9      $4,678.1          $8,131.7
$93.5 million of the other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet as of december 31, 2015 are liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans. defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans; they are not based upon future contributions. due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and our intentions with respect to voluntary contributions, we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond 2016. therefore, this table does not include any amounts related to future contributions to our plans. see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans.
also included in other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet are liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon. due to the uncertainties inherent in these liabilities, such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits, we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made. therefore, this table does not include any obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits. we have also excluded long-term deferred tax liabilities from this table, as they do not represent liabilities that will be settled in cash. see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these tax-related accounts.
we have entered into various agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product r&d milestones, sales milestones, or, at our discretion, to maintain exclusive rights to distribute a product. since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have to be made, we have not included them in this table. these payments could range from $0 to $45 million.
critical accounting estimates our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. significant accounting policies which require managements judgment are discussed below.
excess inventory and instruments  we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much, if any, of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost. similarly, we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply. accordingly, inventory and instruments are written down to their net realizable value. to determine the appropriate net realizable value, we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components. the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work -in-process inventory, which is recorded at cost. obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off. management evaluates the need for changes to inventory and instruments net realizable values based on market conditions, competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis.
income taxes  our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.
we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction. realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits. we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax benefit will be realized. federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the u.s.
30
zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2015 form 10-k annual report the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve. we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances, including existing tax laws, our experience with previous settlement agreements, the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters.
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards boards (fasb) guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.
commitments and contingencies  accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims, related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported. we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims. historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model.
in addition to our general product liability, we have recorded provisions totaling $479.4 million related to the durom cup, including $7.7 million in 2015. see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the durom cup litigation.
goodwill and intangible assets  we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets. as such, these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs. changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets.
we have seven reporting units with goodwill assigned to them. two of these reporting units, cmf and bone healing, consist entirely of assets and liabilities acquired in the biomet merger. since these assets and liabilities were valued at their estimated fair value on the closing date, in our 2015 impairment test, the carrying value approximated the fair value. therefore, if these reporting units perform below what we expected at the time that we estimated their fair value, we may be required to record impairment charges.
our other five reporting units consist of combined zimmer and biomet assets and liabilities. in our 2015 impairment test, our emea reporting units estimated fair value only exceeded the carrying value of its net assets by 8 percent, or approximately $240 million. this reporting units estimated fair value has significantly decreased from prior year impairment tests due to the weakening of the euro against the u.s. dollar. for our other four reporting units, their estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20 percent.
share-based payment  we measure share-based payment expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize expense over the requisite service period. determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock. additionally, we must estimate the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. we estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of actively traded options on our stock. the expected life of stock options and estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors. the assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent managements best estimates.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements to see how recent accounting pronouncements have affected or may affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

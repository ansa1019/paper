item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corporate developments introduction we are a diversified holding company with natural gas and electric utility operations (serving customers in wisconsin, illinois, michigan, and minnesota), an approximately 60% equity ownership interest in atc (a federally regulated electric transmission company), and non-utility electric operations through our we power business. see note 24, segment information, for more information on our reportable business segments.
corporate strategy our goal is to create long-term value for our stockholders and our customers by focusing on the following:
reliability we have made significant reliability related investments in recent years, and plan to continue making significant capital investments to strengthen and modernize the reliability of our generation and distribution network.
•   the west central gas expansion project went into service in early november 2015. this natural gas lateral will allow wisconsin gas to improve the reliability of its natural gas distribution network in the western part of wisconsin and better meet customer demand.
•   pgl is continuing to work on its gas system modernization program (amrp), which primarily involves replacing old cast and ductile iron gas pipes and facilities in the city of chicago's natural gas delivery system with modern polyethylene pipes to reinforce the long-term safety and reliability of the system.
•   wps continues work on its system modernization reliability project, which involves modernizing parts of its electric distribution system by burying or upgrading lines. the project focuses on electric lines that currently have the lowest reliability in its system, primarily in rural areas that are heavily forested.
our investment in reliability related projects has been very successful. in october 2015, we energies, the trade name of wisconsin electric and wisconsin gas, was named the most reliable utility in the midwest by pa consulting group for the fifth year in a row. we energies received the reliabilityonetm award, an annual award that recognizes utilities that excel in delivering reliable electric service.
operating efficiency we continually look for ways to optimize the operating efficiency of our company. we have provided some examples from our generating fleet.
•   vapp is a co-generation plant in milwaukee that was constructed in 1968. the plant originally utilized coal to produce electricity and steam; however, the plant's fuel source was converted to natural gas with construction completed in november 2015. changing the fuel source is expected to reduce operating costs and enhance environmental performance without decreasing the plant's capacity.
•   wisconsin electric received approval from the pscw to make changes at the oak creek expansion units to enable them to burn coal from the powder river basin (prb) in the western united states. the coal plant was originally designed to burn coal mined from the eastern united states, but the price of that coal increased relative to the prb coal in recent years. this project is expected to create flexibility and enable the plant to operate at lower costs, placing it in a better position to be called upon in the miso energy markets, resulting in lower fuel costs for our customers.

financial discipline a strong adherence to financial discipline is essential to meeting our earnings projections and maintaining a strong balance sheet, stable cash flows, attractive dividends, and quality credit ratings.
we follow an asset management strategy that focuses on investing in and acquiring assets consistent with our strategic plans, as well as disposing of assets, including property, plant, and equipment and entire business units that are no longer strategic to operations, are not performing as intended, or have an unacceptable risk profile.
•   see note 2, acquisition, for information about the recent acquisition of integrys.
•   our primary investment opportunities are in three areas: our regulated utility business; our investment in atc; and our generation plants within our we power segment. in addition to the projects discussed above, other on-going projects are discussed in more detail within item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources.
•   see note 3, dispositions, for more information on the pending sale of itf.
exceptional customer care our approach is driven by an intense focus on delivering exceptional customer care every day. we strive to provide the best value for our customers by embracing constructive change, leveraging our capabilities and expertise, and using creative solutions to meet or exceed our customers' expectations.

2015 compared with 2014
earnings increased $50.2 million in 2015, driven by a $30.1 million net increase in earnings due to the inclusion of integrys's results, partially offset by acquisition costs recorded by us and our subsidiaries. integrys was acquired on june 29, 2015. see note 2, acquisition, for more information. also contributing to the increase was a $20.8 million pre-tax gain ($12.5 million after tax) from the sale of minergy llc and its remaining financial assets in june 2015.
2015 form 10-k   42   wec energy group, inc.
2014 compared with 2013
earnings increased $10.9 million in 2014, driven by:
•   a $50.8 million pre-tax ($30.5 million after tax) increase in operating income at wisconsin electric and wisconsin gas driven by lower operation and maintenance expense.
•   a $10.6 million pre-tax ($6.4 million after tax) decrease in interest expense driven by lower debt levels and lower average interest rates on long-term debt.
these increases in our earnings were partially offset by:
•   a $12.5 million decrease in earnings from acquisition costs that were recorded during 2014. see note 2, acquisition, for more information on the acquisition.
•   an $8.1 million increase in income tax expense due to reduced tax benefits associated with lower treasury grant income and decreased afudc - equity.
wisconsin segment contribution to operating income for the periods presented in this annual report on form 10-k, our wisconsin operations included operations for both wisconsin electric and wisconsin gas for all periods, and operations for wps beginning july 1, 2015, due to the acquisition of integrys and its subsidiaries.
electric utility margins are defined as electric revenues less fuel and purchased power costs. we believe that electric utility margins provide a more meaningful basis for evaluating electric utility operations than electric revenues since the majority of prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs are passed through to customers in current rates under enacted fuel rules.
natural gas utility margins are defined as natural gas revenues less the cost of natural gas sold. management believes that natural gas utility margins provide a more meaningful basis for evaluating natural gas utility operations than natural gas utility revenues, since prudently incurred natural gas commodity costs are passed through to our customers in current rates. the average per-unit cost of natural gas sold decreased 34.3% in 2015 and increased 45.8% in 2014, neither of which had an impact on margins.

2015 compared with 2014
operating income operating income at the wisconsin segment increased $114.0 million, driven by a $122.8 million increase due to the inclusion of wps operating income beginning july 1, 2015, as a result of the acquisition of integrys on june 29, 2015. without the inclusion of wps operating income, operating income at the wisconsin segment decreased $8.8 million in 2015.
significant factors impacting the $8.8 million decrease in operating income were:
•   an aggregate $35.8 million decrease in natural gas margins at wisconsin electric and wisconsin gas in 2015. this decrease was primarily driven by a $42.7 million decrease from sales volume variances largely related to warmer weather during the heating
2015 form 10-k   44   wec energy group, inc.
season as well as lower weather-normalized use per customer. as measured by heating degree days, 2015 was 15.1% warmer than 2014. this decrease in margins was partially offset by a $6.4 million net increase in margins as a result of the impact of the wisconsin electric and wisconsin gas pscw rate orders, effective january 1, 2015. see note 22, regulatory environment, for more information.
•   an aggregate $25.5 million increase in other operation and maintenance expense at wisconsin electric and wisconsin gas in 2015. this increase was driven by:
◦   a $48.6 million increase from higher ptf lease expense and associated operating and maintenance expenses as approved in wisconsin electric's pscw rate order, effective january 1, 2015.
◦   a $16.0 million increase in transmission expense from miso and atc related to the iron ore mines returning as customers in february 2015.
◦   these increases in other operation and maintenance expenses were partially offset by:
▪   a $16.1 million decrease in employee benefits in 2015 driven by lower performance units share-based compensation, deferred compensation, and medical costs.
▪   a $9.3 million decrease in electric and natural gas distribution costs in 2015, related to amortization of design software, and maintenance costs.
▪   other decreases in other operation and maintenance expenses that were not individually significant.
•   a $24.5 million increase in other depreciation and amortization expense at wisconsin electric and wisconsin gas, driven by:
◦   an overall increase in utility plant in service in 2015. during 2015, wisconsin gas completed the western gas lateral project, and wisconsin electric completed the conversion of the fuel source for vapp from coal to natural gas.
◦   new depreciation studies approved by the pscw for both the utilities, effective january 1, 2015.
◦   a $7.7 million reduction in income received in 2015 from a treasury grant associated with the completion of our biomass plant in 2013. the lower grant income corresponds to lower bill credits provided to our retail electric customers in wisconsin.
•   a combined $6.0 million increase in property and revenue taxes at wisconsin electric and wisconsin gas in 2015.
these decreases in operating income were significantly offset by an $83.0 million increase in electric margins at wisconsin electric driven by:
•   a $38.4 million increase as a result of the pscw rate order, effective january 1, 2015. see note 22, regulatory environment, for more information.
•   a $35.0 million increase driven by the escrow accounting treatment of the ssr revenues in the pscw rate order, effective january 1, 2015. see note 22, regulatory environment, for more information.
•   a $24.2 million increase due to the return of the iron ore mines as customers in february 2015. the two iron ore mines, which we served on an interruptible tariff rate, switched to an alternative electric supplier effective september 1, 2013. effective february 1, 2015, the owner of the two mines returned them as retail customers. in 2015, we deferred, and expect to continue to defer, the margin from those sales and apply these amounts for the benefit of wisconsin retail electric customers in a future rate proceeding. michigan state law allows the mines to switch to an alternative electric supplier after sufficient notice. see note 23, michigan settlement, for more information. a large portion of this increase in margins was offset by higher transmission expense included in other operation and maintenance expense at wisconsin electric.
•   a $10.4 million increase in positive collections of fuel and purchased power costs compared with costs approved in rates in 2015, as compared with 2014. under the fuel rule, wisconsin electric defers under or over-collections of certain fuel and purchased power costs that exceed a 2% price variance from the costs included in rates, and the remaining variance impacts margins.
2015 form 10-k   45   wec energy group, inc.
•   a $6.2 million increase primarily due to lower fly ash removal costs in 2015. these costs are not included in the fuel rule recovery mechanism.
•   a partially offsetting $22.3 million decrease in electric margins related to sales volume variances in 2015. this decrease was driven by lower margins from residential customers in 2015, primarily due to lower weather-normalized use per customer and warmer weather during the heating season.
•   a partially offsetting $10.8 million decrease in wholesale margins driven by a reduction in sales volumes in 2015. certain wholesale customers have provisions in their contracts which allow them to reduce the amount of energy we provide to them.
2014 compared with 2013
operating income operating income at the wisconsin segment increased $50.8 million in 2014, driven by:
•   a $120.9 million increase in sales for resale in 2014 due to higher sales into the miso energy markets as a result of michigan's alternative electric supplier program and increased availability of our generating units. the margins on these sales are used to reduce fuel costs for our retail customers.
•   a $59.4 million increase in other operating revenues in 2014, primarily driven by the recognition of $56.4 million related to revenues under the ssr agreement with miso. see note 23, michigan settlement, for more information.
•   a $59.3 million decrease in other operation and maintenance expense in 2014. this decrease was primarily driven by lower benefit costs related to pensions, postretirement, and medical costs. our operation and maintenance expenses are influenced by, among other things, labor costs, employee benefit costs, plant outages, and amortization of regulatory assets.
•   a $38.3 million increase in wisconsin net retail pricing in 2014, primarily related to wisconsin electric's pscw rate order, effective january 1, 2013.
•   a $15.8 million increase in natural gas margins, primarily due to colder winter weather in 2014. we estimate that colder winter weather increased natural gas margins by approximately $11.2 million. as measured by heating degree days, 2014 was 5.3% colder than 2013 and 15.4% colder than normal.
these increases in operating income were partially offset by:
•   a $78.4 million decrease in large commercial and industrial sales in 2014 due to the two iron ore mines switching to an alternative electric supplier in september 2013.
•   a $69.5 million increase in electric fuel and purchased power costs in 2014. this increase was primarily driven by a 1.5% increase in total mwh sales and higher generating costs due to an increase in natural gas prices.
•   a $51.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2014. the increase was partially driven by lower income received from a treasury grant in 2014. during 2014, we recognized $17.4 million of income related to a treasury grant associated with the completion of the biomass plant, compared to $48.0 million in 2013. the lower grant income corresponds to the lower bill credits provided to wisconsin electric's retail electric customers in wisconsin in 2014. in addition, an overall increase in utility plant in service as a result of the biomass plant that went into service in november 2013 contributed to the increase in depreciation and amortization expense.
•   a $45.8 million decrease in electric revenues related to unseasonably cool summer weather in 2014. as measured by cooling degree days, 2014 was 36.6% cooler than normal and 32.6% cooler than 2013 due to mild second and third quarters. the unfavorable impact of the cool summer weather was partially offset by the cold winter weather.
◦   residential sales decreased 2.4%, primarily due to the weather.
2015 form 10-k   46   wec energy group, inc.
◦   sales to our large commercial and industrial customers decreased 14.8% primarily due to the loss of the two iron ore mines in michigan. if the mines were excluded, sales to our large commercial and industrial customers would have decreased 1.1%.

we did not have any operations in illinois until our acquisition of integrys on june 29, 2015. since the majority of pgl and nsg customers use natural gas for heating, operating income is sensitive to weather and is generally higher during the winter months.
pgl and nsg recover certain operating expenses directly through separate riders, resulting in no impact on operating income as increases in operating expenses are offset by equal increases in margins. the following table shows the impact of these riders on margins and operating expenses.

earnings from our ownership interest in atc increased $30.1 million when compared to 2014, driven by the increase in our ownership interest from 26.2% to approximately 60% as a result of the acquisition of integrys on june 29, 2015. this increase was partially offset by lower earnings recognized by atc, as atc further reduced earnings in 2015 related to an anticipated refund to customers resulting from a complaint filed with the ferc requesting a lower roe for certain transmission owners. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - factors affecting results, liquidity, and capital resources - other matters - atc allowed roe complaint, for more information.

other income, net increased by $45.5 million when compared to 2014. this increase was primarily due to the $20.8 million gain from the sale of minergy llc and its remaining financial assets in june 2015, as well as higher afudc - equity due to the inclusion of afudc from the integrys companies after the acquisition on june 29, 2015.
2014 compared with 2013
other income, net decreased by $5.4 million, when compared to 2013. this decrease primarily relates to lower afudc - equity related to the biomass plant going into service in november 2013, which was partially offset by an increased gain on asset sales.

interest expense increased by $91.1 million, or 37.9%, when compared to 2014, primarily due to higher debt levels. we assumed approximately $3.0 billion of debt from integrys and its subsidiaries upon the closing of the acquisition on june 29, 2015. additionally, we issued $1.2 billion of long-term debt in june 2015 to finance a portion of the cash consideration for the acquisition of integrys.
2014 compared with 2013
interest expense decreased by $10.6 million, or 4.2%, when compared to 2013, primarily because of lower debt levels and lower average interest rates on long-term debt.

our effective tax rate was 40.4% in 2015 compared to 38.0% in 2014. this increase was primarily due to an increase in non-deductible acquisition related expenses. see note 15, income taxes, for more information. we expect our 2016 annual effective tax rate to be between 37.5% and 38.5%.
2014 compared with 2013
our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 38.0% in 2014 compared to 36.9% in 2013. this increase in our effective tax rate was due to reduced tax benefits associated with treasury grant income, decreased afudc - equity, and non-deductible acquisition related expenses.

operating activities
2015 compared with 2014
net cash provided by operating activities increased $94.7 million in 2015, driven by a $141.6 million increase related to net cash flows from the operating activities of integrys in the last six months of 2015 as a result of the acquisition on june 29, 2015. see note 2, acquisition, for more information.
the remaining $46.9 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities from legacy wisconsin energy corporation companies was driven by:
•   a $141.4 million decrease in cash related to higher payments for operating and maintenance costs in 2015.
•   a $96.8 million increase in contributions to pension and opeb plans in 2015.
these decreases in cash provided by operating activities from legacy wisconsin energy corporation companies were partially offset by a $174.4 million net increase in cash related to lower payments for natural gas, fuel, and purchased power, partially offset by a decrease in cash driven by lower overall collections from customers in 2015. this net increase was primarily due to the impact of lower commodity prices in 2015.
2014 compared with 2013
net cash provided by operating activities decreased $33.3 million in 2014. during 2014, we experienced higher net income, higher depreciation expense and favorable cash flows from accounts receivable, primarily because of the timing of the treasury grant. more than offsetting these favorable items were increases in working capital related to natural gas in storage and increases in regulatory assets.
investing activities
2015 compared with 2014
net cash used in investing activities increased $1,760.7 million in 2015, driven by:
•   an investment of $1,329.9 million related to the june 29, 2015, acquisition of integrys, which is net of cash acquired of $156.3 million. see note 2, acquisition, for more information.
•   a $505.0 million increase in cash used for capital expenditures in 2015, which is discussed in more detail below.
these increases in cash used for investing activities were partially offset by:
•   a $17.3 million increase in cash related to the receipt of the cash surrender value of integrys corporate-owned life insurance policies in 2015.
•   a $15.0 million increase in proceeds from asset sales, driven by the sale of minergy llc and its remaining financial assets in 2015.
2014 compared with 2013
net cash used in investing activities increased $11.0 million in 2014, driven by higher capital expenditures of $36.0 million, which is discussed in more detail below. this increase in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by an increase in proceeds received from asset sales.

2015 compared with 2014
the increase in capital expenditures in the wisconsin segment in 2015 was primarily due to the inclusion of wps as a result of the acquisition of integrys on june 29, 2015. significant projects included in 2015 capital expenditures for wps include the reacttm emission control technology project at weston unit 3 and the system modernization and reliability project, which is a project to underground and upgrade certain electric distribution facilities in northern wisconsin. the wisconsin segment also included increased expenditures in 2015 related to wisconsin gas's western gas lateral project, which was a project to improve the reliability of wisconsin gas's natural gas distribution network in the western part of wisconsin and to better meet customer demand. these increases were partially offset by lower capital expenditures in 2015 for wisconsin electric's conversion of the fuel source for vapp from coal to natural gas, as most of the capital expenditures related to this project were incurred in 2014. for additional discussion regarding reacttm, see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources - capital requirements - capital expenditures and significant capital projects.
the illinois segment includes capital expenditures from pgl and nsg as a result of the acquisition of integrys on june 29, 2015. in 2015, pgl incurred significant capital expenditures related to the amrp.

financing activities
2015 compared with 2014
net cash from financing activities increased $1,618.0 million in 2015, driven by:
•   a $1,900.0 million increase in the issuance of long-term debt in 2015, of which $1,200.0 million related to the acquisition of integrys.
•   an $82.8 million increase in net borrowings of commercial paper in 2015.
these increases in net cash from financing activities were partially offset by:
•   a $205.3 million increase in retirements of long-term debt in 2015, of which $130.1 million was attributable to legacy integrys and its subsidiaries.
2015 form 10-k   52   wec energy group, inc.
•   a $103.4 million increase in dividends paid on common stock due to the issuance of 90.2 million shares associated with the integrys acquisition and an increase in our quarterly dividend rate effective with the closing of the acquisition on june 29, 2015. see note 2, acquisition and note 11, common equity, for more information.
•   a $52.7 million decrease in cash due to the redemption of all of wps's preferred stock in 2015. see note 12, preferred stock, for more information.

the adjusted presentation of our consolidated capitalization structure is presented as a complement to our capitalization structure presented in accordance with gaap. management evaluates and manages our capitalization structure, including our total debt to total capitalization ratio, using the gaap calculation as adjusted by the rating agency treatment of the junior notes. therefore, we believe the non-gaap adjusted presentation reflecting this treatment is useful and relevant to investors in understanding how management and the rating agencies evaluate our capitalization structure.
in february 2016, integrys repurchased and retired approximately $154.9 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.11% junior notes for a purchase price of $128.6 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest, through a modified "dutch auction" tender offer.
for a summary of the interest rate, maturity, and amount outstanding of each series of our long-term debt on a consolidated basis, see our capitalization statements.
as described in note 11, common equity, certain restrictions exist on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. we do not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on our operations or ability to meet our cash obligations.
at december 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants related to outstanding short-term and long-term debt. we expect to be in compliance with all such debt covenants for the foreseeable future. see note 13, short-term debt and lines of credit, for more information about our credit facilities and other short-term credit agreements. see note 14, long-term debt and capital lease obligations, for more information about our long-term debt.
working capital as of december 31, 2015, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by $502.2 million. we do not expect this to have any impact on our liquidity because we believe we have adequate back-up lines of credit in place for ongoing operations. we also have access to the capital markets to finance our construction programs and to refinance current maturities of long-term debt if necessary.
capital requirements acquisition of integrys the acquisition of integrys on june 29, 2015, was financed through the issuance of approximately 90.2 million shares of wisconsin energy corporation common stock, $1.2 billion of long-term debt, and $300.0 million of commercial paper. see note 2, acquisition, for more information on the acquisition.

(7)   obligations for pension and opeb plans cannot reasonably be estimated beyond 2018.
the table above does not include liabilities related to the accounting treatment for uncertainty in income taxes because we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to the amount and period of related future payments at this time. for additional information regarding these liabilities, refer to note 15, income taxes.
aros in the amount of $571.2 million are not included in the above table. settlement of these liabilities cannot be determined with certainty, but we believe the majority of these liabilities will be settled in more than five years.
obligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate-making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers.
capital expenditures and significant capital projects we have several capital projects that will require significant capital expenditures over the next three years and beyond. all projected capital requirements are subject to periodic review and may vary significantly from estimates, depending on a number of factors. these factors include environmental requirements, regulatory restraints and requirements, changes in tax laws and regulations, acquisition and development opportunities, market volatility, and economic trends. our estimated capital expenditures for the next three years are as follows:

(1)   wps is in the process of constructing a multi-pollutant control technology known as reacttm as part of weston unit 3. the control technology will help meet the requirements of a consent decree agreed to between wps and the epa. the technology will also assist with wps's compliance with future air pollution regulations, as well as help maintain a balanced generation portfolio. the cost of the project is estimated at approximately $342.0 million, excluding afudc, with a targeted completion date of april 2016.
(2)   pgl is continuing work on the amrp, a 20-year project that began in 2011 under which pgl is replacing approximately 2,000 miles of chicago's aging natural gas pipeline infrastructure. pgl currently recovers these costs through a surcharge on customer bills pursuant to an icc approved qualifying infrastructure plant rider, which is in effect through 2023. pgl expects to invest between $250 million and $280 million annually over the next three years.
we expect to provide capital contributions to atc (not included in the above table) of approximately $317 million from 2016 through 2018.
common stock matters for information related to our common stock matters, see note 11, common equity.
on january 21, 2016, the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend to $0.4950 per share effective with the first quarter of 2016 dividend payment, which equates to an annual dividend of $1.98 per share. in addition, the board of directors affirmed our dividend policy that continues to target a dividend payout ratio of 65-70% of earnings.
investments in outside trusts we use outside trusts to fund our pension and certain opeb obligations. these trusts had investments of approximately $3.5 billion as of december 31, 2015. these trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates. we contributed $121 million, $13.9 million, and $22.8 million to our pension and opeb plans in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. future contributions to the plans will be dependent upon many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets and long-term discount rates. for additional information, see note 17, employee benefits.
off-balance sheet arrangements we are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit which support construction projects, commodity contracts, and other payment obligations. we believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to our investors. for additional information regarding guarantees and other off-balance sheet arrangements, see note 16, guarantees, and note 21, variable interest entities.
factors affecting results, liquidity, and capital resources market risks and other significant risks we are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. these risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:
regulatory recovery our utilities account for their regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance under the regulated operations topic of the fasb asc. our rates are determined by various regulatory commissions. see item 1. business - d. regulation, for more information on these commissions.
regulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if the regulated entity believes the recovery of these costs is probable. we record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators. recovery of these deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval by those regulators. we assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. if the recovery of these costs is not approved by our regulators, the costs are charged to income in the current period. in general, our regulatory assets are recovered over a period of between one to six years. regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for
2015 form 10-k   56   wec energy group, inc.
amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. we record these items as regulatory liabilities. as of december 31, 2015, our regulatory assets totaled $3,101.7 million and our regulatory liabilities totaled $1,426.0 million.
regarding our reacttm project, the pscw approved deferral of costs above the originally authorized $275.0 million level through 2016. we will be required to obtain a separate approval for collection of these deferred costs. also, prior to the acquisition, integrys initiated an it project with the goal of improving the customer experience. specifically, the project is expected to provide functional and technological benefits to the billing, call center, and credit collection functions. as of december 31, 2015, none of the costs have been disallowed in rate proceedings. we will be required to obtain approval for the recovery of additional costs incurred through the completion of this long-term project see note 22, regulatory environment, for additional information regarding recent and pending rate proceedings, orders, and investigations involving our utilities.
commodity costs in the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations in the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power, and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. we manage our fuel and natural gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long-term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas, and fuel oil. in addition, we manage the risk of price volatility through natural gas and electric hedging programs.
embedded within our utilities' rates are amounts to recover fuel, natural gas, and purchased power costs. our utilities have recovery mechanisms in place that allow them to recover or refund all or a portion of the changes in prudently incurred fuel, natural gas, and purchased power costs from rate case-approved amounts. see item 1. business - d. regulation, for more information on these mechanisms.
higher commodity costs can increase our working capital requirements, result in higher gross receipts taxes, and lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and/or fuel substitution. higher commodity costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write-offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. see note 1(d), revenues and customer receivables, for more information on riders and other mechanisms that allow for cost recovery or refund of uncollectible expense.
weather our utilities' rates are based upon estimated normal temperatures. our electric revenues are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. our natural gas revenues are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. certain of our natural gas utilities have decoupling mechanisms in place that help reduce the impacts of weather. decoupling mechanisms differ by state and allow utilities to recover or refund certain differences between actual and authorized margins. a summary of actual weather information in our utilities' service territories during 2015, 2014, and 2013, as measured by degree days, may be found in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - results of operations.
interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk resulting from our short-term borrowings and projected near-term debt financing needs. we manage exposure to interest rate risk by limiting the amount of our variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates. when it is advantageous to do so, we enter into long-term fixed rate debt. we may also enter into derivative financial instruments, such as swaps, to mitigate interest rate exposure.
based on the variable rate debt outstanding at december 31, 2015, and december 31, 2014, a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of one-percentage point would have increased annual interest expense by $11.0 million and $6.2 million, respectively. this sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in interest rates, with no other changes for the remainder of the period.
2015 form 10-k   57   wec energy group, inc.
marketable securities return we use various trusts to fund our pension and opeb obligations. these trusts invest in debt and equity securities. changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and opeb expenses. additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. we believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by our various utility regulators.
the fair value of our trust fund assets and expected long-term returns were approximately:
(in millions)             as of december 31, 2015          expected return on assets in 2016
pension trust funds            $2,755.1                              7.13                  %
opeb trust funds                 $749.8                              7.25                  %
fiduciary oversight of the pension and opeb trust fund investments is the responsibility of an investment trust policy committee. the committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. the targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long-term financial stability for the plans, and maintain funded levels which meet long-term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near-term benefit payments. investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.
we consult with our investment advisors on an annual basis to help us forecast expected long-term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted-average of long-term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the fund.
economic conditions we have electric and natural gas utility operations that serve customers in wisconsin, illinois, michigan, and minnesota. as such, we are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy. in addition, any economic downturn or disruption of national or international markets could adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and demand for their products, which could affect their demand for our products.
inflation we continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, and regulatory and environmental compliance in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements, and cost reductions. we do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations.
for additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the cautionary statement regarding forward-looking information at the beginning of this report and risk factors in item 1a.
industry restructuring electric utility industry the regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. ferc continues to support large rtos, which affects the structure of the wholesale market. to this end, miso implemented the miso energy markets, including the use of lmp to value electric transmission congestion and losses. increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. it is uncertain when retail choice might be implemented, if at all, in wisconsin. however, michigan has adopted retail choice.

restructuring in wisconsin electric utility revenues in wisconsin are regulated by the pscw. the pscw has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of wisconsin in recent years. the pscw continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the wisconsin legislature. no such legislation has been introduced in wisconsin to date.
restructuring in michigan under michigan law, our retail customers may choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. some of our small retail customers have switched to an alternative electric supplier. the law limits customer choice to 10% of our michigan retail load, but the two iron ore mines in our service territory are excluded from this cap. see note 23, michigan settlement, for information on the mines' ability to switch to an alternative electric supplier. when a customer switches to an alternative electric supplier, we continue to provide distribution and customer service functions for the customer.
natural gas utility industry restructuring in wisconsin the pscw previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of natural gas distribution utilities should change to reflect a competitive environment in the natural gas industry. to date, the pscw has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer classes with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its natural gas marketing affiliates. all of our wisconsin customer classes have workably competitive market choices and, therefore, can purchase natural gas directly from a third party supplier. however, work on deregulation of the natural gas distribution industry by the pscw continues to be on hold. currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position.
restructuring in illinois since 2002, pgl and nsg have provided all of their customers with the option to choose an alternative retail natural gas supplier. pgl and nsg are not required by the icc or state law to make this option available to customers, but since this option is currently provided to customers, pgl and nsg would need icc approval to eliminate it.
pgl and nsg offer natural gas transportation service to customers that select an alternative retail natural gas supplier. transportation customers purchase natural gas directly from an alternative retail natural gas supplier and use pgl's and nsg's distribution systems to transport the natural gas to their facilities. pgl and nsg still earn a distribution charge when they transport natural gas for these customers. as such, the loss of revenue associated with the natural gas that transportation customers purchase from an alternative retail natural gas supplier has little impact on our net income, since it is offset by an equal reduction to natural gas costs.
restructuring in minnesota we are unaware of any current efforts to deregulate the sale of natural gas in minnesota. while potential future efforts to deregulate the sale of natural gas could occur, we are unable to predict the impact of any potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position.
restructuring in michigan the option to choose an alternative retail natural gas supplier has been provided to wps's and mgu's customers since the late 1990s and 2005, respectively. wps and mgu are not required by the mpsc or state law to make this option available to customers, but since this option is currently provided to customers, wps and mgu would need mpsc approval to eliminate it.
wps and mgu offer natural gas transportation service to customers that select an alternative retail natural gas supplier. transportation customers purchase natural gas directly from an alternative retail natural gas supplier and use wps's and mgu's distribution systems to transport the natural gas to their facilities. wps and mgu still earn a distribution charge when they transport natural gas for these customers. as such, the loss of revenue associated with the natural gas that transportation customers purchase from an alternative retail natural gas supplier has little impact on our net income, since it is offset by an equal reduction to natural gas costs.

environmental matters cross-state air pollution rule in july 2011, the epa issued the csapr, which replaced a previous rule, the clean air interstate rule (cair). the purpose of the csapr was to limit the interstate transport of emissions of nox and so2 that contribute to fine particulate matter and ozone nonattainment in downwind states through a proposed allocation plan and allowance trading scheme. the rule was to become effective in january 2012. however, in december 2011, the csapr requirements were stayed by the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit (d.c. circuit court of appeals) and cair was implemented during the stay period. in august 2012, the d.c. circuit court of appeals issued a ruling vacating and remanding csapr and simultaneously reinstating cair pending the issuance of a replacement rule by the epa. the case was appealed to the united states supreme court (supreme court). in april 2014, the supreme court issued a decision largely upholding csapr and remanded it to the d.c. circuit court of appeals for further proceedings. in october 2014, the d.c. circuit court of appeals issued a decision that allowed the epa to begin implementing csapr on january 1, 2015. the compliance deadlines were also changed by three years, so that phase i emissions budgets apply in 2015 and 2016, and phase 2 emissions budgets will apply to 2017 and beyond.
in december 2015, the epa published its proposed update to the csapr for the 2008 ozone naaqs and plans to issue a final rule by august 2016. starting in 2017, this proposed rule would reduce ozone season (may 1 through september 30) nox emissions from power plants in 23 states in the eastern united states. in this rule, the epa is proposing to update phase ii csapr nox ozone season budgets for electric generating units in the 23 states. an approximate 60% reduction in nox emissions is proposed for wisconsin and an approximate 29% reduction is proposed for michigan, beginning in may 2017. additional investments in controls and/or shifts in generation may be required depending upon the final outcome of the rule. we submitted comments to the epa on the potential impacts of the rule.
see note 18, commitments and contingencies, for a discussion of additional environmental matters affecting us, including rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, land quality, renewable energy requirements, and climate change.
other matters american transmission company allowed return on equity complaint in november 2013, a group of miso industrial customer organizations filed a complaint with the ferc requesting to reduce the base roe used by miso transmission owners, including atc, to 9.15%. atc's current authorized roe is 12.2%. in october 2014, the ferc issued an order to hear the complaint on roe and set a refund effective date retroactive to november 12, 2013. the ferc conducted hearings in august 2015, and the alj issued an initial decision in december 2015. the alj's initial decision recommended that atc and all other miso transmission owners be authorized to collect a base roe of 10.32%, as well as the 0.5% incentive adder approved by the ferc in january 2015 for miso transmission owners. the alj's recommendation is not binding to the ferc. a ferc order related to this complaint is expected during the fourth quarter of 2016.
in february 2015, a second complaint was filed with the ferc requesting a reduction in the base roe used by miso transmission owners, including atc, to 8.67%, with a refund effective date retroactive to the filing date of the complaint. the ferc conducted hearings in february 2016 with respect to this second complaint, and an initial decision is expected by june 30, 2016.
in october 2014, the ferc issued an order, in regard to a similar complaint, reducing the base roe for new england transmission owners from their existing rate of 11.14% to 10.57%. in this order, the ferc used a revised method for determining the appropriate roe for ferc-jurisdictional electric utilities. the ferc expects its new methodology will narrow the "zone" of reasonable returns on equity. the ferc has stated that it expects future decisions on pending complaints related to similar roe issues to be guided by the new england transmission decision.
any change to atc's roe could result in lower equity earnings and distributions from atc in the future. we are currently unable to determine how the ferc may rule in these complaints. however, we believe it is probable that refunds will be required upon resolution of these issues. based on the alj's initial decision in december 2015, atc reduced its earnings, which resulted in us recognizing lower earnings from our investment in atc.

wisconsin power and light's (wp&l) riverside energy center facility in april 2015, wp&l filed a cpcn application with the pscw for approval to construct an approximate 650 mw natural gas-fired combined-cycle generating unit in beloit, wisconsin. recent construction proposals received by wp&l indicate that the unit could generate up to 700 mws. in the third quarter of 2015, wisconsin electric and wps requested and received intervention in this proceeding. as intervenors, wisconsin electric and wps proposed purchased power agreement alternatives to the new generating unit. in december 2015, wisconsin electric, wps, and wp&l entered into a settlement agreement that was approved by the pscw. based on the settlement agreement, the generating unit cannot become commercially operational before june 1, 2020. in addition, wp&l must enter into a purchased power agreement with wisconsin electric for miso planning years 2017, 2018, and 2019, whereby wisconsin electric will sell and wp&l will purchase capacity and energy at certain agreed upon prices. wps also will have the option to purchase an undivided ownership interest of up to 100 mws of generating capacity from the unit during the first two years of operation and up to an aggregate 200 mws of generating capacity during the third and fourth years of operation. other major terms of the settlement included agreement on ownership of future wisconsin electric and wps natural gas units, negotiation of a renewable generation joint development plan, and ownership terms of the jointly-owned columbia plant.
bonus depreciation provisions the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 was signed into law on december 18, 2015. this act extended 50% bonus depreciation to assets placed in service during 2015 through 2017, 40% bonus depreciation to assets placed in service during 2018, and 30% bonus depreciation to assets placed in service during 2019. bonus depreciation is an additional amount of deductible depreciation that is awarded above and beyond what would normally be available. due to the resulting increase in federal tax depreciation, we did not make federal income tax payments for 2015, 2014, or 2013.
critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with gaap requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. the application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and anticipated recovery of costs. these judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. in addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.
the following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.
goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if a triggering event occurs. if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, impairment may be present. when evaluating goodwill for impairment, a qualitative assessment, referred to as the step zero approach, may first be performed to determine whether further quantitative analysis is necessary. if the qualitative assessment indicates that a reporting unit's fair value more likely than not exceeds its carrying value, the two-step quantitative analysis is unnecessary. however, the quantitative analysis needs to be performed if the qualitative assessment indicates that a reporting unit's carrying value more likely than not exceeds its fair value. the quantitative analysis involves calculating the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. since the qualitative assessment is optional, companies are allowed to proceed directly to the quantitative analysis.
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units that carried a goodwill balance effective august 31, 2015. our reporting units are the same as our reportable segments. we performed the step zero qualitative analysis since all of our reporting units were either valued recently in connection with the acquisition of integrys or passed their most recent goodwill impairment test by a significant amount. in addition, no events occurred that would have more likely than not caused a significant decrease in the fair values of our reporting units. events and circumstances we considered when performing the step zero analysis included, but were not limited to, macro-economic conditions, market and industry conditions, internal cost factors, share price fluctuations, competitive environment, and the operational stability and overall financial performance of the reporting units. after evaluating and weighing all relevant events and circumstances, we concluded that the carrying amounts of our reporting units were

significantly exceeded by their respective fair values. consequently, no reporting units were at risk of impairment. no impairment charges were recorded in 2015 as a result of our qualitative annual impairment assessment.
our reporting units had the following goodwill balances at december 31, 2015:

pension and other postretirement employee benefits the costs of providing non-contributory defined pension benefits and opeb, described in note 17, employee benefits, are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience.
pension and opeb costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels, and employment periods), the level of contributions made to the plans, and earnings on plan assets. pension and opeb costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets, mortality and discount rates, and expected health care cost trends. changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and opeb costs.
pension and opeb plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. fluctuations in actual equity and fixed income market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods. we believe that such changes in costs would be recovered or refunded at our utilities through the ratemaking process.
the following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the projected benefit obligation and the reported net periodic pension cost. each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only.

in the fourth quarter of 2014, the society of actuaries published a new set of mortality tables, which updated life expectancy assumptions. we have adjusted the tables to better reflect our plan-specific mortality experience and other general assumptions. we have incorporated the revised mortality tables into the projected pension and opeb obligations at december 31, 2015.

the discount rates are selected based on hypothetical bond portfolios consisting of noncallable (or callable with make-whole provisions), noncollateralized, high-quality corporate bonds with maturities between 0 and 30 years. the bonds are generally rated "aa" with a minimum amount outstanding of $50.0 million. from the hypothetical bond portfolios, a single rate is determined that equates the market value of the bonds purchased to the discounted value of the plans' expected future benefit payments.
we establish our expected return on assets based on consideration of historical and projected asset class returns, as well as the target allocations of the benefit trust portfolios. the assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets was 7.37% in 2015, and 7.25% in both 2014 and 2013, respectively. the actual rate of return on pension plan assets, net of fees, was (3.85)%, 6.17%, and 10.92%, in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
in selecting assumed health care cost trend rates, past performance and forecasts of health care costs are considered. for more information on health care cost trend rates and a table showing future payments that we expect to make for our pension and opeb, see note 17, employee benefits.
regulatory accounting our utility operations follow the guidance under the regulated operations topic of the fasb asc. our financial statements reflect the effects of the ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating us. certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as revenues and expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers, as authorized by our regulators. future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured and is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness. once approved, the regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into earnings over the rate recovery period. if recovery or refund of costs is not approved or is no longer considered probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in current period earnings. management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as changes in the regulatory environment, earnings at the electric and natural gas utilities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation.
the application of the regulated operations topic of the fasb asc would be discontinued if all or a separable portion of our utility operations no longer meet the criteria for application. our regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off as a charge to income as an unusual or infrequently occurring item in the period in which discontinuation occurred. as of december 31, 2015, we had $3,101.7 million in regulatory assets and $1,426.0 million in regulatory liabilities. see note 6, regulatory assets and liabilities, for more information.
unbilled revenues we record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. however, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. at the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. this unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses, and applicable customer rates. significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. total utility operating revenues during 2015 of approximately $5.8 billion included accrued utility revenues of $418.3 million as of december 31, 2015.
income tax expense we are required to estimate income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing financial statements. this process involves estimating current income tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for income tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our balance sheets. we also assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. to the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance, which is offset by an adjustment to the provision for income taxes in the income statements.
uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations and the outcomes of tax audits and appeals requires that judgments and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of effective tax rates. only income tax benefits that meet the "more likely than not" recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized. unrecognized tax benefits
2015 form 10-k   63   wec energy group, inc.
are re-evaluated quarterly and changes are recorded based on new information, including the issuance of relevant guidance by the courts or tax authorities and developments occurring in the examinations of our tax returns.
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets. the assumptions involved are supported by historical data, reasonable projections, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. see note 1(n), income taxes, and note 15, income taxes, for a discussion of accounting for income taxes.

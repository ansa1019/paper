overview we are a leading operator of more than 13,800 discount retail stores and we conduct our operations in two reporting segments. our dollar tree segment is the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price point of $1.00. our family dollar segment operates general merchandise discount retail stores providing consumers with a selection of competitively-priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores.
our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise.  two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends.  first is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through mergers or acquisitions.  second is the performance of our stores once they are open. sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next.  we refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales, because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared, beginning after the first fifteen months of operation.  we include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales, which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales.  the term 'expanded' also includes stores that are relocated. our comparable store net sales calculation only includes our dollar tree stores as our family dollar stores were acquired on july 6, 2015. stores that have been rebannered are considered to be new stores and are not included in the calculation of comparable store net sales until after the first fifteen months of operation under the new banner.
at january 30, 2016, we operated stores in 48 states and the district of columbia, as well as stores in five canadian provinces. a breakdown of store counts and square footage by segment for the years ended january 30, 2016 and january 31, 2015, respectively, are as follows (family dollar's beginning amounts are as of the july 6, 2015 acquisition date):

stores are included as rebanners when they close or open, respectively. comparable store net sales for dollar tree may be negatively affected when a family dollar store is rebannered near an existing dollar tree store. the average size of stores opened in 2015 was approximately 8,030 selling square feet (or about 10,000 gross square feet) for the dollar tree segment and 7,000 selling square feet (or about 8,200 gross square feet) for the family dollar segment.  for 2016, we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately 8,000 - 10,000 selling square feet (or about 10,000 - 12,000 gross square feet) for the dollar tree segment and approximately 6,000 - 8,000 selling square feet (or about 7,000 - 9,000 gross square feet) for the family dollar segment.  we believe that these size stores are in the ranges of our optimal sizes operationally and give our customers a shopping environment which invites them to shop longer, buy more and make return visits, which increases our customer traffic.

fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 which ended on january 30, 2016, january 31, 2015 and february 1, 2014, respectively, each included 52 weeks.
in fiscal 2015, comparable store net sales increased by 2.1%.  the comparable store net sales increase was the result of a 1.4% increase in the number of transactions and a 0.8% increase in average ticket.  we believe comparable store net sales continued to be positively affected by a number of our dollar tree initiatives, as debit and credit card penetration continued to increase in 2015, and we continued the rollout of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more of our dollar tree stores.  at january 30, 2016, the dollar tree segment had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately 4,285 stores, which includes rebannered stores, compared to approximately 3,620 stores at january 31, 2015.  we believe that the addition of frozen and refrigerated product enables us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers.  in addition, the dollar tree segment accepts food stamps (under the supplemental nutrition assistance program ("snap")) in approximately 5,600 qualified stores compared to 5,000 at the end of 2014.
our point-of-sale technology provides us with valuable sales and inventory information to assist our buyers and improve our merchandise allocation to our stores.  we believe that this has enabled us to better manage our inventory flow in our stores resulting in more efficient distribution and store operations.
we must continue to control our merchandise costs, inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses as increases in these items could negatively impact our operating results.
we previously announced that we will rebanner our deals stores in 2015 and 2016. the majority of the deals stores will be rebannered as dollar tree stores and the remaining stores will be rebannered as family dollar stores. in 2015, 52 stores were rebannered and we recorded $15.5 million in expenses in connection with the rebannering in fiscal 2015.
acquisition on july 27, 2014, we executed an agreement and plan of merger to acquire family dollar in a cash and stock transaction. on july 6, 2015 (the "acquisition date") we completed the acquisition and family dollar became a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary. under the acquisition, the family dollar shareholders received $59.60 in cash and 0.2484 shares of our common stock for each share of family dollar common stock they owned, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares (the "merger consideration").
as of the acquisition date, each outstanding performance share right of family dollar common stock was canceled in exchange for the right of the holder to receive the merger consideration (the "psr payment"). the aggregate amount we paid for the merger consideration and psr payment was $6.8 billion in cash and we issued 28.5 million shares of our common stock, valued at $2.3 billion based on the closing price of our common stock on july 2, 2015.
for a complete description of the acquisition refer to our current report on form 8-k filed with the sec on july 8, 2015.
we incurred $39.2 million and $28.5 million in acquisition-related expenses in 2015 and 2014, respectively, excluding acquisition-related interest expense. we also expended approximately $165.7 million in capitalizable debt issuance costs related to the financing of the acquisition and $129.8 million of debt-issuance costs was included as a reduction in "long-term debt, net, excluding current portion" at january 30, 2016.
we expect to achieve approximately $300 million in annual cost savings synergies by the end of the third year after closing, and that we will incur $300 million in one-time costs to achieve these synergies. we project that the acquisition will be dilutive to earnings per share in the first twelve months following closing on a gaap basis; however, we expect it will be accretive excluding the one-time costs to achieve synergies.
in 2015, we completed the offering of $3.25 billion of senior notes and entered into a credit facility and term loan providing for $6.2 billion in senior secured credit facilities. see "liquidity and capital resources" for a further discussion of these transactions.
in connection with the acquisition, we agreed to divest 330 family dollar stores to settle federal trade commission charges that the acquisition would be anticompetitive in certain local markets. the 330 family dollar stores represent approximately $45.5 million of annual operating income. in accordance with purchase accounting, the net effect of the divestiture on our assets and liabilities is fully reflected in the table summarizing the preliminary estimates of fair value set forth in "note 2 - acquisition" and the consolidated balance sheet of dollar tree, inc. as of january 30, 2016 included in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this form 10-k. the divestiture was completed on november 1, 2015 and the primary expected future effect of the sale on the consolidated income statements of dollar tree, inc. will be that we will lose the operating income associated with the divested stores and will incur approximately $5.0 million to $10.0 million in closing costs and set-up costs for transition services. over a period expected to be no more than 24 months, we will provide certain transition services to the buyer for which we expect to be reimbursed by the buyer at our direct operating costs for those services.

fiscal year ended january 30, 2016 compared to fiscal year ended january 31, 2015
net sales.  net sales increased 80.2%, or $6,896.2 million, in 2015 compared to 2014, resulting from $6,162.0 million of net sales from family dollar since the acquisition date, sales in the dollar tree segment's new stores and increased comparable store sales. comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and, to a lesser extent, are negatively affected when we open new stores, rebanner stores or expand stores near existing ones.
gross profit. gross profit increased by $1,622.7 million, or 53.5%, to $4,656.7 million in 2015 compared to $3,034.0 million in 2014. the dollar increase in gross profit was primarily driven by $1,407.4 million of gross profit for family dollar as well as higher sales for dollar tree. our gross profit margin is negatively impacted by the overall lower-margin product mix for the family dollar segment. included in family dollar's cost of sales is $73.0 million of markdown expense related to sku rationalization and planned liquidations and $70.2 million for amortization of the stepped-up inventory value for inventory which was sold during 2015.
selling, general and administrative expenses.  selling, general and administrative expenses for 2015 increased to $3,607.0 million from $1,993.8 million in 2014, an increase of $1,613.2 million or 80.9%. the increase was primarily due to $1,438.2 million of expense for family dollar. as a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 23.3% for 2015 compared to 23.2% for 2014.  in 2015, we incurred $39.1 million or 25 basis points of expenses related to the acquisition compared to $28.5 million or 35 basis points in 2014. excluding acquisition expenses, the selling, general and administrative rate increased to 23.0% in 2015 compared to 22.8% in 2014. the increase is primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales resulting from the recording of favorable lease rights and fixed assets at their fair values in connection with the acquisition.
operating income.  operating income for 2015 increased to $1,049.7 million compared with $1,040.2 million in 2014, an increase of $9.5 million or 0.9%. operating income margin decreased from 12.1% in 2014 to 6.8% in 2015. the increase in operating income was due to a $40.3 million increase in the dollar tree segment partially offset by a $30.8 million operating loss in the family dollar segment. the decrease in operating income margin is a result of the family dollar segment operating loss due to unusually high markdowns related to sku rationalization and planned liquidations and the amortization of stepped-up inventory sold in 2015 as well as higher depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales resulting from the recording of favorable lease rights and fixed assets at their fair values in connection with the acquisition.
interest expense, net. interest expense, net was $599.4 million in 2015 compared to $80.1 million in 2014 due to the following:
•   a $161.9 million increase in interest for debt issued in conjunction with the acquisition compared with interest on the senior notes;
•   an $89.5 million prepayment penalty on retirement of the senior notes;
•   a $39.5 million prepayment penalty for the term loan b refinancing;
•   a $27.3 million write-off of the debt discount and deferred financing costs due to the term loan b refinancing;
•   a $19.0 million write-off of deferred financing costs due to a $1.0 billion prepayment of the term loan b-1; and
•   a $12.1 million increase in loan commitment fees on the new debt structure.

income taxes.  our effective tax rate was 37.0% in 2015 compared to 37.2% in 2014. the rate decrease is due to the utilization of a capital loss to offset the previously recognized gain on our investment in ollie's holdings, inc. and additional work opportunity tax credits partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance.
fiscal year ended january 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year ended february 1, 2014
net sales.  net sales increased 9.7%, or $761.9 million, in 2014 compared to 2013, resulting from sales in our new stores and a 4.3% increase in comparable store net sales. comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and, to a lesser extent, are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones.
gross profit. gross profit margin was 35.3% in 2014 compared to 35.6% in 2013 due to increased freight costs partially offset by leverage in occupancy costs from the higher comparable store sales increase.
selling, general and administrative expenses.  selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, remained at 23.2% for 2014 compared to 2013. excluding $28.5 million or approximately 35 basis points of expenses related to the family dollar acquisition, the selling, general and administrative rate was 22.9%. the decrease is primarily due to lower store payroll, health insurance and workers' compensation costs.
operating income.  operating income margin was 12.1% in 2014 compared to 12.4% in 2013. excluding the approximately 35 basis points of acquisition-related expenses, operating income margin was 12.4% in 2014 as lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were offset by lower gross profit margin for the reasons noted above.
interest expense, net. interest expense, net increased $64.7 million due to $46.7 million of commitment fees related to the financing of the family dollar acquisition and a full year of interest expense on the $750.0 million of senior notes issued in september 2013.
other expense, net.  other expense, net in 2014 increased $5.3 million primarily due to unfavorable fair market value adjustments for our diesel fuel hedges.
income taxes.  our effective tax rate was 37.2% in 2014 compared to 37.5% in 2013. the rate decrease is the result of lower state tax rates and additional work opportunity tax credits in 2014.
segment information we operate a chain of more than 13,800 retail discount stores in 48 states and five canadian provinces. our operations are conducted in two reporting business segments: dollar tree and family dollar. we define our segments as those operations whose results our chief operating decision maker ("codm") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources.
the dollar tree segment is the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of $1.00. the dollar tree segment includes our operations under the "dollar tree," "dollar tree canada," "deals" and "dollar tree deals" brands, ten distribution centers in the united states and two in canada and a store support center in chesapeake, virginia.
the family dollar segment operates a chain of general merchandise retail discount stores providing consumers with a selection of competitively priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores. the family dollar segment consists of our operations under the "family dollar" brand, eleven distribution centers and a store support center in matthews, north carolina.
we measure the results of our segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales, gross profit and operating income (loss). we may revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including the allocation of distribution center and store support center costs, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by the codm. when the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation.
because the acquisition occurred in the fiscal year ended january 30, 2016, comparable information for the family dollar segment is not provided. in addition, results for the fiscal year ended january 31, 2015 and the fiscal year ended february 1, 2014 only include the dollar tree segment; therefore, comparative information for these periods, which is included above, is not provided in this discussion.

net sales for dollar tree increased 8.5% in 2015 compared to 2014 due to sales from new stores and a comparable store sales increase of 2.5% on a constant currency basis.
gross profit margin for dollar tree decreased to 34.8% in 2015 compared to 35.3% in 2014. the decrease in gross profit margin was due to:
•   higher distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales;
•   higher shrink as a result of unfavorable physical inventory results; and
•   higher markdowns due to deals markdowns taken on multi-price inventory in preparation for their conversion to dollar tree stores.
operating income margin for dollar tree decreased to 11.6% in 2015 compared to 12.1% in 2014. excluding acquisition costs of $39.2 million or 40 basis points in 2015 and $28.5 million or 35 basis points in 2014, operating income margin was 12.0% and 12.4% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. excluding acquisition costs, the decrease in operating income margin was the result of lower gross profit margin as noted above and higher professional fees related to the family dollar integration partially offset by lower payroll costs as a percentage of net sales due to lower profit sharing contributions.
liquidity and capital resources our business requires capital to build and open new stores, expand our distribution network and operate and expand existing stores.  our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in september and october.  historically, we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities.

net cash provided by operating activities decreased $145.9 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to lower net income, net of depreciation and amortization, an decrease in accrued expenditures related to the family dollar acquisition, an increase in cash used to purchase merchandise inventories and an increase in accounts payable.
net cash provided by operating activities increased $132.7 million in 2014 compared to 2013 due primarily to an increase in accrued expenditures related to the family dollar acquisition and a decrease in cash used to purchase merchandise inventories.
net cash used in investing activities increased $6,663.4 million in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to the acquisition of family dollar and higher capital expenditures.
31
net cash used in investing activities decreased $10.0 million in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to reduced capital expenditures, increased proceeds on fixed asset dispositions and reduced purchases of restricted investments.
in 2015, net cash provided by financing activities increased $6,085.0 million compared to 2014 primarily due to the issuance of the acquisition-related debt partially offset by the repayment of the senior notes and principal payments on the term loans.
in 2014, net cash used in financing activities decreased $583.2 million compared to 2013 primarily due to $1.1 billion of share repurchases and the repayment of $250.0 million in long-term debt in 2013 partially offset by the issuance of $750.0 million of senior notes in 2013.
at january 30, 2016, our long-term borrowings were $7,465.5 million.  we also have $120.0 million, $110.0 million and $100.0 million letter of credit reimbursement and security agreements, under which approximately $210.1 million were committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise at january 30, 2016.
in september 2013, we entered into a note purchase agreement with institutional accredited investors in which we issued and sold $750.0 million of senior notes (the "notes") in an offering exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of 1933. the notes consist of three tranches: $300.0 million of 4.03% senior notes due september 16, 2020; $350.0 million of 4.63% senior notes due september 16, 2023; and $100.0 million of 4.78% senior notes due september 16, 2025. interest on the notes was payable semi-annually on january 15 and july 15 of each year. the notes were unsecured and ranked pari passu in right of repayment with our other senior unsecured indebtedness. we could prepay some or all of the notes at any time in an amount not less than 5% of the original aggregate principal amount of the notes to be prepaid, at a price equal to the sum of (a) 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and (b) the applicable make-whole amount. in the event of a change in control (as defined in the note purchase agreement), we could have been required to prepay the notes. the note purchase agreement contained customary affirmative and restrictive covenants. we used the net proceeds of the notes to finance share repurchases.
on january 20, 2015, we entered into the first amendment (the " notes amendment") to the note purchase agreement, with a majority of the noteholders party thereto. the notes amendment was entered into in connection with our pending acquisition (the "acquisition") of family dollar stores, inc. ("family dollar"). the notes amendment allowed, among other things, a newly-formed subsidiary of dollar tree to issue debt and hold the proceeds in escrow pending consummation of the acquisition (such debt, the "escrow debt"). pursuant to the terms of the notes amendment, in certain circumstances the amount of interest due on the notes could increase by 1.0% per annum. the notes amendment also contains certain negative covenants and other restrictions applicable during the period in which any escrow debt is outstanding. on the acquisition date, we prepaid the notes outstanding of $750.0 million and paid $89.5 million, determined in accordance with the provisions of the dollar tree npa plus additional interest in accordance with the provisions of the first amendment to the dollar tree npa.
in june 2012, we entered into a five-year $750.0 million unsecured credit agreement (the agreement).  the agreement provided for a $750.0 million revolving line of credit, including up to $150.0 million in available letters of credit.  the interest rate on the agreement was based, at our option, on a libor rate, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin.  the agreement also bore a facilities fee, calculated as a percentage, as defined, of the amount available under the line of credit, payable quarterly. the agreement also bore an administrative fee payable annually.  the agreement, among other things, required the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios, restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness.
in september 2013, we amended the agreement to enable the issuance of the notes.
on august 15, 2014, we entered into an amendment (the "credit amendment") to the agreement. the credit amendment further amends the agreement to facilitate the issuance and/or borrowings of certain third-party debt financing to finance the acquisition. the credit amendment also facilitates escrow arrangements related to the acquisition. on the acquisition date, we paid in full all amounts owing under the agreement and terminated all commitments to extend further credit thereunder.
on february 23, 2015, we completed the offering of $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2020 (the "2020 notes") and $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.75% senior notes due 2023 (the "2023 notes", and together with the 2020 notes, the "acquisition notes"). the acquisition notes were offered only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on rule 144a under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"), and outside the united states, only to non-u.s. investors pursuant to regulation s under the securities act. the acquisition notes have not been registered under the securities act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the united states absent an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from registration requirements or a transaction not subject to the registration requirements of the securities act or any state securities laws.
32
we used the proceeds of the acquisition notes to finance in part the acquisition. the acquisition notes are jointly and severally guaranteed on an unsecured, unsubordinated basis, subject to certain exceptions, by each of our subsidiaries that guarantees the obligations under our new senior secured credit facilities or certain other indebtedness, including family dollar and certain of its subsidiaries.
the 2020 notes, which mature on march 1, 2020, were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of february 23, 2015, with u.s. bank national association, as trustee (the "2020 notes indenture"). the 2023 notes, which mature on march 1, 2023, were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of february 23, 2015, with u.s. bank national association, as trustee (the "2023 notes indenture", and together with the 2020 notes indenture, the "indentures").
interest on the acquisition notes is due semiannually on march 1 and september 1 of each year and commenced on september 1, 2015. no principal is due on the acquisition notes until their maturity dates.
the indentures contain covenants that limit our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions: (i) incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness; (ii) declare or pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to, or purchase or otherwise acquire or retire for value, equity interests; (iii) make any principal payment on, or redeem or repurchase, subordinated debt; (iv) make loans, advances or other investments; (v) incur liens; (vi) sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries; (vii) consolidate or merge with or into, or sell all or substantially all assets to, another person; and (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates. the indentures also provide for certain events of default, which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding acquisition notes under the applicable indenture to be declared immediately due and payable.
on march 9, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement, with jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., as administrative agent, providing for $6.2 billion in senior secured credit facilities (the "new senior secured credit facilities") consisting of a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility (the "new revolving credit facility") and $4.95 billion of term loan facilities (the "new term loan facilities"). the new term loan facilities consist of a $1.0 billion term loan a tranche and a $3.95 billion term loan b tranche. the new revolving credit facility and the borrowings under the term loan a tranche mature five years after the acquisition date, unless any of the 2020 notes remain outstanding as of 91 days prior to their stated maturity, in which case the new revolving credit facility and the borrowings under the term loan a tranche will mature at such time. the borrowings under the term loan b tranche mature seven years after the acquisition date.
upon the consummation of the acquisition, we drew the term loans under the term loan a facility and have the ability to borrow under the new revolving credit facility.
on june 11, 2015, we amended the terms of the new senior secured credit facilities to refinance the term loan b tranche with $3.3 billion of floating-rate term b-1 loans and $650.0 million of fixed-rate term b-2 loans. on january 26, 2016, we prepaid $1.0 billion of the $3.3 billion term b-1 loan.
the new senior secured credit facilities were not guaranteed by us or any of our subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the acquisition, but upon and after the acquisition date, the new senior secured credit facilities are guaranteed by certain of our direct or indirect wholly owned u.s. subsidiaries, including family dollar and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "credit agreement guarantors"). upon and after the acquisition date, the new senior secured credit facilities are secured by a security interest in substantially all the assets of dollar tree and the credit agreement guarantors, subject to certain exceptions.
the loans under the term loan a tranche and the new revolving credit facility bear interest at libor plus 2.25% per annum (or a base rate plus 1.25%), the term b-1 loans of the new senior secured credit facilities bear interest at libor plus 2.75% per annum (or a base rate plus 1.75%) and the term b-2 loans bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.25%. the term b-1 tranche is subject to a "libor floor" of 0.75%. the term loan a tranche of the new term loan facilities requires quarterly amortization payments of 1.25% of the original principal amount thereof in the first year following the acquisition date, 2.5% of the original principal amount thereof in the second year following the acquisition date, and 3.75% of the original principal amount thereof thereafter. the term b-1 loans require quarterly amortization payments of 0.25% of the original principal amount thereof after the acquisition date and the term b-2 loans do not require amortization payments prior to maturity. the new term loan facilities, excluding the term b-2 loans, also require mandatory prepayments in connection with certain asset sales and out of excess cash flow, among other things, and subject in each case to certain significant exceptions. we expect to pay certain commitment fees in connection with the new revolving credit facility. additionally, the term b-1 loans will require us to pay a 1.0% prepayment fee if the loans thereunder are subject to certain repricing transactions before june 11, 2016. the term b-2 loans will require us to pay a 2.0% prepayment fee if they are repaid in the second year after the refinance date and a 1.0% prepayment fee if they are repaid in the third year after the refinance date.
33
the new senior secured credit facilities contain representations and warranties, events of default and affirmative and negative covenants. these include, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, restrictions on our ability to declare or pay dividends, repay the acquisition notes, create liens, incur additional indebtedness, make investments, dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with any other person. in addition, a financial maintenance covenant based on our consolidated first lien secured net leverage ratio will apply to the new revolving credit facility and the term loan a tranche of the new term loan facilities.
annual interest expense is expected to approximate $360.0 million in 2016, $20.0 million of which is non-cash amortization of debt-issuance costs.
historically we have used cash to repurchase shares but we did not repurchase any shares in fiscal 2015 and 2014.  we repurchased 17.4 million shares for $1,112.1 million in fiscal 2013.  at january 30, 2016, we have $1.0 billion remaining under board repurchase authorization.
funding requirements overview, including off-balance sheet arrangements we expect our cash needs for opening new stores and rebannering and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2016 to total approximately $457.9 million, which includes capital expenditures, initial inventory and pre-opening costs.
at january 30, 2016, we have $1,250.0 million available under our new revolving credit facility, less amounts outstanding for letters of credit totaling $123.0 million.
our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are between $650.0 million and $670.0 million, including planned expenditures for our new and expanded stores, the addition of freezers and coolers to approximately 400 stores, the completion the dollar tree segment's eleventh distribution center and the expansion of our stockton, california distribution center.  we believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our new revolving credit facility.

credit facility and term loans. on march 9, 2015, the escrow issuer entered into a credit agreement, with jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., as administrative agent, providing for $6.2 billion in senior secured credit facilities (the "new senior secured credit facilities") consisting of a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility (the "new revolving credit facility") and $4.95 billion of term loan facilities (the "new term loan facilities"). the new term loan facilities consist of a $1.0 billion term loan a tranche and a $3.95 billion term loan b tranche. the new revolving credit facility and the borrowings under the term loan a tranche mature five years after the acquisition date, unless any of the 2020 notes remain outstanding as of 91 days prior to their stated maturity, in which case the new revolving credit facility and the borrowings under the term loan a tranche will mature at such time. the borrowings under the term loan b tranche mature seven years after the acquisition date. upon and after the acquisition date, the new senior secured credit facilities are guaranteed by certain of our direct or indirect wholly-owned u.s. subsidiaries, including family dollar and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "credit agreement guarantors"). upon and after the acquisition date, the new senior secured credit facilities are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets and those of the credit agreement guarantors, subject to certain exceptions.
on june 11, 2015, the escrow issuer amended the terms of the new senior secured credit facilities to refinance the term loan b tranche with $3.3 billion of floating-rate term b-1 loans and $650.0 million of fixed-rate term b-2 loans. the loans under the term loan a tranche and the new revolving credit facility bear interest at libor plus 2.25% per annum (or a base rate plus 1.25%), the term b-1 loans of the new senior secured credit facilities bear interest at libor plus 2.75% per annum (or a base rate plus 1.75%) subject to a "libor floor" of 0.75%. the term b-2 loans bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.25%.

secured senior notes. we assumed the liability for $300.0 million of 5.0% senior notes due february 1, 2021 which were issued by family dollar on january 28, 2011 through a public offering. these unsecured notes became secured upon closing of the acquisition. these notes are equally and ratably secured with the term loans.
forgivable promissory note. in 2012, we entered into a promissory note with the state of connecticut under which the state loaned us $7.0 million in connection with our acquisition, construction and installation of land, building, machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in windsor, connecticut. if certain performance targets are met, the loan and any accrued interest will be forgiven in fiscal 2017. if the performance targets are not met, the loan and accrued interest must be repaid over a five-year period beginning in fiscal 2017.
interest on long-term borrowings.  these amounts represent interest payments on the acquisition notes, term loans, senior secured notes and forgivable promissory note using the interest rates for each at january 30, 2016.

commitments letters of credit and surety bonds.  we are a party to three letter of credit reimbursement and security agreements providing $120.0 million, $110.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively for letters of credit.  letters of credit are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise and we had approximately $210.1 million of purchases committed under these letters of credit at january 30, 2016.
we also have approximately $123.0 million of letters of credit outstanding that serve as collateral for our large-deductible insurance programs and $47.9 million of surety bonds outstanding primarily for certain utility payment obligations at some of our stores and self-insured insurance programs. subsequent to year-end, amounts outstanding for stand-by letters of credit increased to $183.3 million as of february 10, 2016.
technology assets.  we have commitments totaling approximately $7.0 million to primarily purchase store technology assets and maintenance for our stores during 2016.
telecommunication contracts.  we have contracted for telecommunication services with contracts expiring in 2020.  the total amount of these commitments is approximately $142.7 million.
derivative financial instruments in 2015, 2014 and 2013, we were party to fuel derivative contracts with third parties which included approximately 6.6 million, 1.6 million and 2.8 million gallons of diesel fuel, or approximately 36%, 10% and 20% of the dollar tree segment's domestic truckload fuel needs, respectively.  these derivative contracts did not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore all changes in fair value for these derivatives are included in earnings.
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates.  certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates.  following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical.
inventory valuation as discussed in "note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies" under the caption "merchandise inventories" in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" beginning on page 48 of this form 10-k, inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted-average basis.  cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted-average basis.  under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories.  the retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis.
inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments, including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink, which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins.  the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could, under certain circumstances, result in costs not being recorded in the proper period.
we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, quantities of slow moving or seasonal carryover merchandise on hand, historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans.  the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors, some of which are outside of our control, including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends.  historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results.
our accrual for shrink is based on the actual, historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted, if necessary, for current economic conditions and business trends.  these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger.  our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and september of each year; therefore, the shrink accrual recorded at january 30, 2016 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2015, including the fourth quarter.  we have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates beyond approximately 10-20 basis points in our dollar tree segment for the last few years.  however, we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition.  the amounts recorded in the current year reflect the dollar tree and family dollar segments' historical results. we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent.

our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis.
in our family dollar segment, we receive vendor support in the form of cash payments or allowances through a variety of reimbursements such as purchase discounts, cooperative advertising, markdowns, scandowns, and volume rebates. we have agreements with vendors setting forth the specific conditions for each allowance or payment. in accordance with asc 605-50, "revenue recognition - customer payments and incentives," depending on the arrangement, we either recognize the allowance as a reduction of current costs or recognize the benefit over the period the related merchandise is sold. if the payment is a reimbursement for costs incurred, it is offset against those related costs; otherwise, it is treated as a reduction to cost of goods sold.
accrued expenses on a monthly basis, we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred.  certain expenses, such as legal reserves, require a high degree of judgment and our most material estimates include domestic freight expenses, self-insurance costs, store-level operating expenses, such as property taxes and utilities, and certain other expenses.
we are involved in numerous legal proceedings and claims. our accruals, if any, related to these proceedings and claims are based on a determination of whether or not the loss is both probable and estimable. we review outstanding matters with external counsel to assess the probability of an unfavorable outcome and estimates of loss. we re-evaluate outstanding proceedings and claims each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available, and we adjust or establish accruals, if necessary. our legal proceedings are described in "note 5 - commitments and contingencies" under the caption "contingencies" in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" beginning on page 59 of this form 10-k.
our freight and store-level operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical trends and results.  our workers' compensation, general liability and health insurance accruals are recorded based on third-party actuarial valuations which we obtain at least annually.  for our workers' compensation and general liability accruals, these actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors. for our health insurance accrual, the actuary provides an estimate based on historical claims and claim payment timing. certain other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them.  the related accruals are adjusted as management's estimates change.
differences in management's estimates and assumptions could result in expenses which are materially different from the calculated accruals. our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low.  historically, the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
business combinations-purchase price allocation for the family dollar acquisition, we allocated the purchase price to the various tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values, which are preliminary as of january 30, 2016. determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which are inherently uncertain. we engaged third party experts to assist in the determination of fair value for complex assets and liabilities. many of the estimates and assumptions used to determine fair values, such as those used for intangible assets are made based on forecasted information and discount rates. in addition, the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations.
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values. these assets, including goodwill, are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment. an additional evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred. such events or circumstances could include, but are not limited to, significant negative industry or economic trends, unanticipated changes in the competitive environment and a significant sustained decline in the market price of our stock.
for purposes of our goodwill impairment evaluation, the reporting units are family dollar, dollar tree and dollar tree canada. goodwill has been assigned to the reporting units based on prior business combinations related to the brands. we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using projected future cash flows that are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital analysis that reflects current market conditions. management judgment is a significant factor in the goodwill impairment evaluation process. the computations require management to make estimates and assumptions. actual values may differ significantly from these judgments, particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environments for our reporting units. critical assumptions that are used as part of these evaluations include:
•the potential future cash flows of the reporting unit. the projections use management's estimates of economic and
37
market conditions over the projected period, including growth rates in revenue, gross margin and expense. the cash flows are based on our most recent business operating plans and various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. we believe that the assumptions and rates used in our 2015 impairment evaluations are reasonable; however, variations in the assumptions and rates could result in significantly different estimates of fair value.
•   selection of an appropriate discount rate. calculating the present value of future cash flows requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate, which is based on a weighted-average cost of capital analysis. the discount rate is affected by changes in short-term interest rates and long-term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants. given current economic conditions, it is possible that the discount rate will fluctuate in the near term. the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for our reporting units ranged from 10.0% to 13.3% for the 2015 analysis.
indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as the family dollar tradename, are not subject to amortization but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. the indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying values. we estimate the fair value of tradename intangible assets based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. this approach is dependent upon a number of factors, including estimates of future growth and trends, royalty rates, discount rates and other variables. we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. our impairment evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets did not result in an impairment charge.
income taxes on a quarterly basis, we estimate our required income tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets.  our income taxes payable are estimated based on currently enacted tax rates and estimated state apportionment factors.  management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and management's projections for future taxable income.  we cannot guarantee that we will generate taxable income in future years.  historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual.
in addition, we have a recorded liability for our estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns.  judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws, including relevant case law, and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and, if so, judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority.  income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded.  we believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions is adequate.  for further discussion of our changes in reserves during 2015, see "note 4 - income taxes" in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" beginning on page 56 of this form 10-k.
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales, comparable store net sales, operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue.  our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including:
•   shifts in the timing of certain holidays, especially easter;
•   the timing of new store openings;
•   the net sales contributed by new stores;
•   changes in our merchandise mix; and
•   competition.
our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons.  easter was observed on april 20, 2014 and on april 5, 2015, and will be observed on march 27, 2016.  we believe that the earlier easter in 2016 could result in a $10.0 million decrease in sales in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the first quarter of 2015.  we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter.  in anticipation of increased sales activity during these months, we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our continuing store staff.  our operating results, particularly operating and net income, could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the easter season for any reason, including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems, changes in consumer sentiment or inclement weather.
our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in a table in "note 12 - quarterly financial information (unaudited)" in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" beginning on page 75 of this form 10-k.

inflation and other economic factors our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price in our dollar tree stores and on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control.  consumer spending could decline because of economic pressures, including unemployment and rising fuel prices.  reductions in consumer confidence and spending could have an adverse effect on our sales.  national or international events, including war or terrorism, could lead to disruptions in economies in the united states or in foreign countries.  these and other factors could increase our merchandise costs, fuel costs and other costs that are critical to our operations, such as shipping and wage rates.
shipping costs.  trans-pacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based on shipping industry market conditions and fuel costs.  we can give no assurances as to the final rate trends for 2016, as we are in the early stages of our negotiations.
minimum wage. multiple states and local jurisdictions passed legislation that increased their minimum wages in 2016 and 2017 and the federal government has made indications that it may consider increasing the federal minimum wage. as a result, we believe our expenses will increase except to the extent that we are able to offset our payroll costs with savings in our operations.
currency fluctuations. we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our operations in canada.

operating statement classifications net sales.    net sales from our operations are a factor of volumes shipped, product mix and related pricing. we charge premium prices for certain grades of steel, product dimensions, certain smaller volumes, and for value-added processing or coating of the steel products. except for our steel fabrication operations, we recognize revenue from sales and the allowance for estimated costs associated with returns from these sales at the time the title of the product is transferred to the customer. provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on estimates and actual historical experience. net sales from steel fabrication operations are recognized from construction contracts utilizing a percentage of completion methodology based on steel tons used on completed units to date as a percentage of estimated total steel tons required for each contract.
costs of goods sold.    our costs of goods sold represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products. the principal elements of these costs are scrap and scrap substitutes (which represent the most significant single component of our consolidated costs of goods sold), steel,
37
direct and indirect labor and related benefits, alloys, zinc, transportation and freight, repairs and maintenance, utilities (most notably electricity and natural gas), and depreciation.
selling, general and administrative expenses.    selling, general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales, finance and accounting, and administrative departments. these costs include, among other items, labor and related benefits, professional services, insurance premiums, property taxes, company-wide profit sharing, and amortization of intangible and other assets.
interest expense, net of capitalized interest.    interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt net of interest costs that are required to be capitalized during the construction period of certain capital investment projects.
other (income) expense, net.    other income consists of interest income earned on our temporary cash deposits and investments; any other non-operating income activity, including income from non-consolidated investments accounted for under the equity method. other expense consists of any non-operating costs, such as acquisition and certain financing expenses.
2015 overview we are one of the largest steel producers and one of the largest metals recyclers in the united states based on a current estimated annual steelmaking and coating capability of approximately 11 million tons, and actual recycling volumes. the primary sources of our revenues and operating income are from the manufacture and sale of steel products, processing and sale of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals, and the fabrication and sale of steel joist and deck products. in the third quarter 2015, we changed our reportable segments consistent with how we currently manage the business, representing three reporting segments: steel operations, metals recycling operations, and steel fabrication operations.
metals recycling operations segment asset impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded pretax non-cash impairment charges related to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles and certain other assets associated with omnisource, the company's metal recycling operations, which reduced 2015 operating income by $428.5 million, and net income and net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by $268.7 million, and basic and diluted earnings per share by $1.11. during the company's 2015 annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analysis, we determined that the fair value of omnisource was less than its carrying value, and upon the completion of the second step of the impairment analysis, that the goodwill and trade name indefinite-lived intangible assets were impaired. the omnisource goodwill and trade name assets were written down to their respective fair values, resulting in non-cash asset impairment charges of $341.3 million and $68.5 million, respectively. upon the december 31, 2015 determination and classification of certain omnisource property and plant assets as held for sale, the company recorded a $10.3 million non-cash asset impairment. the company reflected a total of $428.5 million of pretax non-cash asset impairment charges in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31, 2015, within the metals recycling operations.
our 2015 consolidated operational and financial results were negatively impacted by decreased steel shipments (excluding columbus flat roll division for the 2015 and 2014 periods) and average steel product pricing, driven by continuing excessive and historically high levels of steel imports. while scrap costs also decreased significantly throughout 2015, steel metal margins contracted as the drop in steel selling prices was more severe than the decline of scrap costs. underlying domestic steel consumption remained steady, as we continue to see improvements in non-residential construction, as well as steady consumption in automotive and other manufacturing segments. however, a larger portion
38
of the domestic steel demand was served by imports in 2015 than compared to 2014. as a result of this, as well as customer destocking, domestic steel mill utilization rates decreased throughout 2015, as compared to 2014, resulting in decreased ferrous scrap shipments in our metals recycling operations. decreased shipments, along with metal margin compression due to monthly price declines, resulted in significantly reduced profitability in our metals recycling operations in 2015, as compared to 2014. during 2015, our steel fabrication operations continued to benefit from the sustained improvements in non-residential construction demand, our market share and expanding geographic footprint, and lower steel raw material costs, resulting in significant increases in both sales and operating income, compared to 2014.
excluding the impact of the $428.5 million and $260.0 million in pretax non-cash impairment charges in 2015 and 2014, respectively, consolidated operating income decreased $224.6 million, or 39%, to $355.7 million in 2015, compared to $580.3 million in 2014, and net income decreased $151.3 million, or 52%, to $138.3 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, during 2015, compared with net income of $289.6 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, during 2014. the impact of the $428.5 million pretax non-cash impairment charge related to our metals recycling operations reduced 2015 net income by $268.7 million and our diluted earnings per share by $1.11. the impact of the $260.0 million pretax non-cash impairment charge related to our minnesota ironmaking operations, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $46.5 million, reduced 2014 net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by $132.6 million and our diluted earnings per share by $0.55.
2014 overview acquisition of severstal columbus, llc. (columbus flat roll division)
on september 16, 2014, we completed our acquisition of columbus flat roll division, on a debt-free basis, for a purchase price of $1.625 billion, with additional working capital adjustments of $44.4 million. the columbus flat roll division acquisition was funded through the issuance of $1.2 billion of senior notes, borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, and available cash. we purchased columbus flat roll division to significantly expand and diversify our steel operating base, with the addition of 3.4 million tons of hot roll steel production capacity. the product offerings are diversified with respect to width, gauge, and strength, when compared to the capabilities of our butler flat roll division. located in northeast mississippi, columbus flat roll division is one of the newest and most technologically advanced sheet steel electric arc furnace mills in north america, with access to non-energy related pipe and tube, oil country tubular goods (octg) and automotive markets. additionally, columbus flat roll division is advantageously located to serve the growing markets in the southern u.s. and mexico, providing geographic diversification and growth opportunities. columbus flat roll division operating results have been reflected in our financial statements since the effective date of the acquisition, in the steel operations. columbus flat roll division reported revenues of $638.3 million and pretax income of $56.1 million during the september 16 to december 31, 2014, period, before giving effect to $26.4 million of purchase accounting related cost of goods sold expenses associated with the step-up in inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets, and $25.2 million of acquisition and related costs that are included in other expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31,
2014.
minnesota ironmaking operations impairment during the fourth quarter of 2014, our minnesota ironmaking operations reached a steady operating state, indicating a consistency in the operation's production capability, processes and cost structure, including the ability to utilize certain lower-cost raw materials. given this, we undertook an assessment of the recoverability of the carrying value of our minnesota ironmaking operation's fixed assets. given our outlook at that time regarding future operating costs and product pricing,
39
we concluded that the carrying value of these fixed assets was no longer fully recoverable, and the fixed assets were in fact impaired. this assessment resulted in a $260.0 million pretax non-cash impairment charge, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $46.5 million, which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by
$132.6 million. the impact of losses from our minnesota ironmaking operations on 2014 net income, including the impact of the $260.0 million of pretax non-cash impairment charges, was approximately $165.9 million. excluding the $260.0 million in pretax non-cash asset impairment charges, the impact of minnesota ironmaking operations on 2014 net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. was approximately $33.3 million, as compared to approximately $41.9 million in 2013.
net sales in 2014 of $8.8 billion increased 19% from 2013 net sales of $7.4 billion, due to increased shipments in all of our operating segments, and higher average selling prices in our steel and steel fabrication operations. we achieved record volumes in our steel and steel fabrication operations, which reported increased shipments of 19% (4% without columbus flat roll division) and 31%, respectively, in 2014, as compared to 2013. demand continued to be strong in the automotive and manufacturing markets, the non-residential construction markets continued to improve, and we began to realize sales from our new special-bar-quality smaller-diameter rolling mill at our engineered bar products division and from our premium rail expansion at our structural and rail division. our metal spreads in steel and steel fabrication operations also improved, as market pricing increased to a greater degree than raw materials costs. plant utilization was also strong, which resulted in volume-related cost compression in our steel and steel fabrication operations. while shipments increased at our metals recycling operations, operating income decreased in 2014, when compared to 2013, due to decreases in metal spreads. the impact of losses from our minnesota ironmaking operations on 2014 net income, reflected in "other", including the impact of the $260.0 million of pretax non-cash asset impairment charges, was approximately $165.9 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, as compared to approximately $42 million, or $0.18 per diluted share in 2013. as a result of the above, net income in 2014, including the impact of impairment charges, decreased $32.3 million or 17%, to $157.0 million, or $0.67 per diluted share.
excluding the impact of the $260.0 million in pretax non-cash asset impairment charges, consolidated operating income increased $193.8 million, or 50%, to $580.3 million in 2014, compared to $386.5 million in 2013, and net income increased $100.3 million, or 53%, to $289.6 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, during 2014, compared with net income of $189.3 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, during 2013. the impact of the $260.0 million pretax non-cash asset impairment charge related to our minnesota ironmaking operations, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $46.5 million, reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by $132.6 million and our diluted earnings per share by $0.55.

steel operations shipments and average selling price segment results 2015 vs. 2014
overall steel operations performance in 2015 compared to 2014 was negatively impacted by continuing excessive and historically high levels of steel imports, customers destocking inventories, and sharply falling steel and scrap prices. domestic steel consumption was relatively steady during 2015, with strong automotive and improving non-residential steel markets, but a large portion of the domestic consumption was served by imports. net sales for the steel operations decreased 7% in 2015, when compared to 2014, as a 14% increase in steel operations shipments was more than offset by a decrease of $149 per ton, or 18%, in average selling prices. in spite of solid overall domestic steel demand, average selling prices decreased throughout 2015 due to elevated levels of imported steel into the united states and significant reductions in the cost of scrap, which also caused uncertainty for steel consumers. steel operations shipments increased 14% in 2015 compared to 2014 with the inclusion of columbus flat roll division for the full year of 2015 (acquired september 16, 2014), as 2015 sales volumes, excluding them, were down 12% compared to 2014.
metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant steel manufacturing cost. during 2015 and 2014, our metallic raw material costs represented 55% and 65%, respectively, of our steel operations' manufacturing costs, excluding the operations of the techs, which purchases, rather than produces, the steel it further processes. our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel operations decreased $105, or 29%, in 2015, compared with 2014, consistent with overall declines in scrap market pricing.
decreases in steel selling prices more than offset decreases in raw material cost per ton, resulting in 2015 metal spread (which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of ferrous scrap consumed) contracting significantly compared to 2014. thus, despite increased shipments from the inclusion of columbus flat roll division for the full year 2015 versus only four and a half months in 2014, operating income for the steel operations decreased 41%, to $403.2 million, compared to 2014.
43
segment results 2014 vs. 2013
net sales for steel operations increased in 2014 by $1.1 billion, or 24%, ($638.3 million, or 13%, of which related to the addition of columbus flat roll division), compared to 2013, with the segment achieving record shipments of 7.4 million tons in 2014. selling volumes increased for both our sheet products (26%, of which 24% was related to columbus flat roll division) and long products (12%) in 2014, compared to 2013, and overall product mix shifted somewhat toward sheet products with the acquisition of columbus flat roll division. our engineered bar products and structural and rail divisions achieved increased shipments of 32% and 12%, respectively. demand for our sheet products remained strong in the automotive and manufacturing markets. customer demand for our special-bar-quality products strengthened from the prior year, and we began selling smaller diameter products produced from our recent expansion project. demand for structural steel products improved with the continued growth in the non-residential construction market, and we began to realize sales from our expansion into premium rail. in addition, despite pressure from increased imports in 2014, our average steel selling prices improved by $35 per ton, or 4%, over those in 2013 on the strength of improved domestic market demand in 2014.
our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel operations increased $7 in 2014 compared with 2013. during 2014 and 2013, our metallic raw material costs represented 65% of our steelmaking operations' manufacturing costs, excluding the operations of the techs, which purchases, rather than produces, the steel it further processes. as a result of record shipments and metal spread, operating income for the steel operations increased 32%, to $683.6 million in 2014, compared to $516.1 million in 2013.
metals recycling operations segment metals recycling operations segment.    metals recycling operations consists solely of omnisource, our metals recycling, processing, and ferrous scrap procurement operations. omnisource sells ferrous metals to steel mills and foundries, and nonferrous metals, such as copper, brass, aluminum and stainless steel to, among others, ingot manufacturers, copper refineries and mills, smelters, and specialty mills. our metals recycling operations accounted for 19%, 25%, and 31% of our consolidated net sales in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

segment results 2015 vs. 2014
overall metals recycling operations performance in 2015 compared to 2014 was negatively impacted by excess domestic scrap competition, a strong u.s. dollar tempering scrap exports, and lower
44
domestic steel mill utilizations, resulting in substantial decreases in selling prices. metals recycling operations net sales decreased 34% in 2015 as compared to 2014, with ferrous and nonferrous volumes both decreasing 8% in 2015, as compared to 2014. similarly, both ferrous and nonferrous selling prices declined 37% and 18%, respectively, during 2015, as compared to 2014, consistent with overall declines in scrap market selling prices. metal spreads (which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased scrap) for ferrous and nonferrous materials contracted 14% and 18%, respectively, during 2015 as compared to 2014 as selling prices declined more than scrap costs. operating loss for the metals recycling operations in 2015 of $448.1 million includes $428.5 million of pretax non-cash asset impairment charges related to goodwill, trade name and other assets. excluding the impairment charges, metals recycling operations segment operating loss is $19.6 million compared to operating income of $26.0 million in 2014.
segment results 2014 vs. 2013
net sales for metals recycling operations increased 8% in 2014 as compared to 2013, as nonferrous volumes increased 12% with steady pricing, while ferrous volumes were slightly higher and selling prices increased 2%. operating income for the metals recycling operations decreased $15.9 million, or 38%, in 2014, when compared to 2013, as the decreases in both ferrous and nonferrous metal spreads of 8% and 2%, respectively, more than offset the impact of the increased nonferrous, and to a lesser degree, ferrous shipments.
steel fabrication operations segment steel fabrication operations segment.    steel fabrication operations consist of our eight new millennium building systems plants located throughout the united states and northern mexico. revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of trusses, girders, steel joists and steel deck used within the non-residential construction industry. steel fabrication operations accounted for 9%, 7%, and 6% of our consolidated net sales during 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

segment results 2015 vs. 2014
overall steel fabrication operations performance in 2015 compared to 2014 was positively impacted by a recovering non-residential construction market, increased average selling prices, and lower costs of manufacturing due to lower steel input prices. net sales for the steel fabrication operations increased $41.6 million, or 7%, in 2015, compared to 2014, as shipments increased 3% and average selling prices increased $51 per ton, or 4%, with increased demand. our steel fabrication operations continue to realize strength in order activity and resulting shipments and selling prices, as we leverage our national operating footprint and market demand continues to improve.
the purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of production for our steel fabrication operations, generally representing more than two-thirds of the total cost of manufacturing. the average cost of steel consumed decreased by 14% in 2015, as compared to 2014, and coupled with 4% higher selling prices resulted in significantly expanded metal spreads. as a result of record shipments, increased selling prices and metal spread expansion, as well as decreased conversion costs realized from manufacturing efficiencies, operating income increased 123% to $115.9 million in 2015, as compared to $51.9 million in 2014.
on september 14, 2015, we purchased from csi certain of its steel deck facilities (including associated assets) and net working capital of approximately $30 million, for a purchase price of $45 million in cash. operating results of these facilities have been reflected in our financial statements since the september 14, 2015, purchase date, in the steel fabrication operations. the purchased assets include two deck facilities located in memphis, tennessee, and phoenix, arizona. producing both standard and premium specialty deck profiles, the new locations will allow for enhanced geographic reach into the southwestern and western markets, and further diversify new millennium building systems' product offerings.
segment results 2014 vs. 2013
steel fabrication operations net sales increased $192.2 million, or 44%, in 2014, compared to 2013, as shipments increased 31% and average selling prices increased $116 per ton, or 10%, with increased demand. our steel fabrication operations experienced strength in order activity and resulting shipments at levels in excess of overall improving consumer demand during 2014, as we continued to leverage our national footprint to expand market share. the average cost of steel consumed increased in 2014, as compared to 2013, by $47 per ton, consistent with increased pricing in the general relevant steel market. operating income for the steel fabrication operations of $51.9 million in 2014 was over seven times that of 2013, due to record level shipments and metal spread expansion, as well as decreased conversion costs realized from manufacturing efficiencies and from higher production volumes.
other operations other operations consists of subsidiary operations that are below the quantitative thresholds required for reportable segments and primarily consist of our minnesota ironmaking operations, which were indefinitely idled in may 2015, and several smaller joint ventures. also included in "other" are certain unallocated corporate accounts, such as the company's senior secured credit facility, senior notes, certain other investments and certain profit sharing expenses. prior to being indefinitely idled, our minnesota ironmaking operations experienced operating losses. in addition, upon deciding to idle the minnesota ironmaking operations and to monetize existing raw material inventory, we recorded an inventory lower-of-cost or market charge of $21.0 million (inclusive of noncontrolling interests of $3.6 million), in cost of goods sold in the second quarter 2015. operating losses associated with our minnesota ironmaking operations have been significantly curtailed post-idling. the impact of losses
46
from our minnesota ironmaking operations on 2015 net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. was approximately $27.9 million, as compared to $165.9 million in 2014.
during the fourth quarter of 2014, our minnesota ironmaking operations reached a steady operating state, indicating a consistency in the operation's production capability, processes and cost structure, including the ability to utilize certain lower-cost raw materials. given this, we undertook an assessment of the recoverability of the carrying value of our minnesota ironmaking operation's fixed assets. given our outlook at that time regarding future operating costs and product pricing, we concluded that the carrying value of these fixed assets was no longer fully recoverable, and the fixed assets were in fact impaired. this assessment resulted in a $260.0 million pretax non-cash impairment charge, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $46.5 million, which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by $132.6 million. the impact of losses from our minnesota ironmaking operations on 2014 net income, including the impact of the $260.0 million of pretax non-cash impairment charges, was approximately $165.9 million. excluding the $260.0 million in pretax non-cash impairment charges, the impact of minnesota ironmaking operations on 2014 net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. was approximately $33.3 million, as compared to approximately $41.9 million in 2013.
consolidated results 2015 vs. 2014
selling, general and administrative expenses.    selling, general and administrative expenses (including profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets) of $376.0 million during 2015 were comparable to $385.9 million during 2014, representing approximately 4.9% and 4.4% of net sales, respectively.
interest expense, net of capitalized interest.    during 2015, interest expense increased $17.7 million, or 12%, to $154.0 million, when compared to 2014. the increase in interest expense is due primarily to the addition of the $1.2 billion senior notes in september 2014, in conjunction with our acquisition of columbus flat roll division, partially offset by the conversion or payoff at maturity of $287.5 million of 5.125% convertible notes in june 2014, and the call of our $350.0 million 75/8% senior notes due 2020 in march 2015.
other expense, net.    during 2015, net other expense of $15.4 million included $16.7 million of call premium and other financing costs associated with the march 2015 senior notes call and prepayment. net other expense of $18.3 million in 2014 included $25.2 million of acquisition and financing costs associated with our september 2014 columbus flat roll division acquisition.
income tax expense (benefit).    during 2015, our income tax benefit was $96.9 million at an effective income tax rate of 40.0%, as compared to expense of $73.2 million resulting in an effective income tax rate of 44.4% during 2014. the higher effective tax rate in 2014 was due primarily to the impact of the increased noncontrolling interest losses, offset somewhat by increased benefits from other permanent tax benefit items, most notably the domestic manufacturing deduction.
included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31, 2015, of $16.0 million are potential benefits of $11.7 million that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. we recognize interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies on a net-of-tax basis in income tax expense (benefit). during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recognized benefits from the reduction of interest expense of $100,000, net of tax. in addition to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above, we had $5.2 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at december 31, 2015.
we file income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions. the irs is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the years 2010 and 2011. at this time we do not believe there will be any significant examination adjustments that would result in a material change to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. it is
47
reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months as a result of these federal income tax audits, and state income tax audits. based on the current audits in process, the payment of taxes as a result of audit settlements could be in an amount from zero to $7.1 million by the end of 2016. with the exception of the 2010 federal return, which is currently under examination, we are no longer subject to federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years ended before 2011.
consolidated results 2014 vs. 2013
selling, general and administrative expense.    selling, general and administrative expenses (including profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets) were $385.9 million during 2014, as compared to $332.3 million during 2013, an increase of $53.6 million, or 16%. during 2014 and 2013, these selling, general and administrative expenses represented approximately 4.4% and 4.5% of net sales, respectively. the increase in total sg&a expenses in 2014 compared to 2013 relates most notably to the increased profit sharing, incentive compensation and stock compensation expenses of $35.5 million, which increased due to increased profitability before the minnesota ironmaking operations asset impairment charges. while total intangible assets increased slightly due to the acquisition of columbus flat roll division, amortization of intangible assets decreased $4.2 million, or 13%, during 2014 compared to 2013 due to the accelerated amortization methods used for intangible assets related to existing customer and scrap generator relationships.
interest expense, net of capitalized interest.    during 2014, gross interest expense increased $7.4 million, or 6%, to $139.7 million, and capitalized interest decreased $2.1 million, to $2.5 million, as compared to 2013. the decrease in interest capitalized during these periods relates to growth or expansion projects initiated in 2013 at two of our steel mills that were completed in 2014. the increase in gross interest expense is due primarily to the addition of the $1.2 billion senior notes in september 2014, in conjunction with our acquisition of columbus flat roll division, partially offset by the conversion or payoff at maturity of $287.5 million of 5.125% convertible notes in june 2014.
other (income) expense, net.    other expense increased $22.3 million to $18.3 million during 2014, as compared to other income of $4.0 million during 2013, due primarily to $25.2 million in acquisition and finance costs associated with the acquisition of columbus flat roll division.
income tax expense (benefit).    during 2014, our income tax expense was $73.2 million, as compared to $99.3 million during 2013, and our effective income tax rate before exclusion of noncontrolling interests was 44.4% and 37.8%, for 2014 and 2013, respectively. the higher effective income tax rate in 2014 is due primarily to the impact of the increased noncontrolling interest losses, offset somewhat by increased benefits from other permanent tax benefit items, most notably the domestic manufacturing deduction. the 2013 effective tax rate benefited from the effects of additional stock option exercises during 2013, and 2012 research and development tax credits enacted in january 2013.
liquidity and capital resources columbus flat roll division acquisition.    in september 2014, we issued $700.0 million of 5.125% senior notes due 2021 and $500.0 million of 5.500% senior notes due 2024 (together, the senior notes). the proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes, along with cash on hand and $117.8 million in borrowings under our senior secured credit facility were used to fund the september 16, 2014, acquisition of columbus flat roll division and related expenses.
capital resources and long-term debt.    our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for, among other things, the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steelmaking and finishing operations and to remain in compliance with environmental laws. our
48
short-term and long-term liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements, capital expenditures, principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness, dividends to our shareholders, and acquisitions. we have met these liquidity requirements primarily with cash provided by operations, long-term borrowings and availability under our revolver. we had record liquidity at december 31, 2015, is as follows (in thousands):
cash and equivalents        $727,032
revolver availability               1,187,170
total liquidity             $1,914,202
our total outstanding debt decreased $387.2 million during 2015, to $2.6 billion, due primarily to our march 2015 call and prepayment of $350.0 million in 75/8% senior notes due 2020. as a result, our total long-term debt to capitalization ratio (representing our long-term debt, including current maturities, divided by the sum of our long-term debt, redeemable noncontrolling interests, and our total stockholders' equity) decreased to 49.6% at december 31, 2015, from 51.6% at december 31, 2014.
we have a senior secured credit facility (facility) that matures in november 2019 which provides for a $1.2 billion revolver along with a term loan facility. subject to certain conditions, we also have the ability to increase the combined facility size by a minimum of $750 million. the facility contains financial and other covenants pertaining to our ability (which may under certain circumstances be limited) to make capital expenditures; incur indebtedness; permit liens on property; enter into transactions with affiliates; make restricted payments or investments; enter into mergers, acquisitions or consolidations; conduct asset sales; pay dividends or distributions and enter into other specified transactions and activities. our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants. at december 31, 2015, we had $1.2 billion of availability on the revolver, $12.8 million of outstanding letters of credit and other obligations which reduce availability, and there were no borrowings outstanding.
the financial covenants under our facility state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.50:1.00. our interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our last-twelve trailing months (ltm) consolidated adjusted ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and certain other non-cash transactions as allowed in our facility) by our ltm gross interest expense, less amortization of financing fees. in addition, a net debt (as defined in the facility) to consolidated ltm adjusted ebitda (net debt leverage ratio) of not more than 5.00:1.00 must be maintained. if the net debt leverage ratio exceeds 3.50:1:00 at any time, our ability to make certain payments as defined in the facility (which includes cash dividends to stockholders and share purchases, among other things), is limited. at december 31, 2015, our interest coverage ratio and net debt leverage ratio were 4.76:1.00 and 2.99:1.00, respectively. we were, therefore, in compliance with these covenants at december 31, 2015, and we anticipate we will continue to be in compliance during the next twelve months.
working capital.    we generated cash flow from operations of over $1.0 billion in 2015. operational working capital (representing amounts invested in trade receivables and inventories, less current liabilities other than income taxes payable and debt) decreased $476.8 million during 2015 to $1.2 billion. amounts invested in accounts receivable and inventories, net of accounts payable, decreased $530.5 million in conjunction with a decrease in sales and production volume and a significant decrease in the cost of scrap and steel when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014.
capital investments.    during 2015 we invested $114.5 million in property, plant and equipment, consistent with the $111.8 million during 2014. our current estimated 2016 cash allocation plan includes the investment of between $250 million and $300 million in capital expenditures in our existing and announced operations.
49
cash dividends.    as a reflection of confidence in our current and future cash flow generation ability and financial position, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 20% to $0.1375 per share in 2015 (from $0.115 per share in 2014), resulting in declared cash dividends of $133.2 million during 2015, compared to $108.6 million during 2014. we paid cash dividends of $127.6 million and $105.4 million during 2015 and 2014, respectively. our board of directors, along with executive management, approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis. the determination to pay cash dividends in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors, after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, outstanding indebtedness, current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans. in addition, the terms of our senior secured credit facility and the indenture relating to our senior notes may restrict the amount of cash dividends we can pay.
other.    our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which, in turn, will depend upon general economic, financial and business conditions, along with competition, legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control. in addition, we cannot assure that our operating results, cash flows, access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future. we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth, cash flows from operations, together with other available sources of funds, including additional borrowings under our revolver through its term, which expires in november 2019, will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, funding working capital requirements, and anticipated capital expenditures.
during 2015 we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements and credits of approximately $23.6 million. based on our current abatements and incentive credits, and utilizing our existing long-lived asset structure, we estimate the remaining annual benefit to our future operations to be approximately $23.6 million, $23.6 million, $11.9 million, $2.5 million, $1.4 million, $1.3 million, and $1.2 million during the years 2016 through 2022, respectively.

other matters inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations.
environmental and other contingencies we have incurred, and in the future will continue to incur, capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control, remediation, monitoring and compliance. during 2015, we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately $35.7 million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately $6.2 million. of the costs incurred during 2015 for monitoring and compliance, 78% were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in our steelmaking processes and other facilities, in accordance with legal requirements. we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately $850,000 at all of our facilities during 2015. we have an accrual of $2.2 million recorded for environmental remediation related to our metals recycling operations and $2.7 million related to minnesota ironmaking operations. we believe, apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and any future manufacturing facilities, that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity; however, environmental laws and regulations evolve and change, and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future, such as the impact of u.s. government or various governmental agencies introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential of climate change.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u. s. we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions. we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts.    except for our steel fabrication operations, we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated returns from these sales when the title of the product transfers. provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on historical experience. if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends, additional provision may be necessary. the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the company's best estimate of probably credit losses, along with historical experience, which estimates may or may not prove accurate. our steel fabrication operations recognizes revenues from construction contracts using a percentage of completion methodology based on steel tons used on completed units to-date as a percentage of estimated total steel tons required by each contract.
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers, which in steel operations are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to
52
numerous industry sectors, including the automotive, construction, manufacturing, transportation, heavy and agriculture equipment, and pipe and tube (including octg) markets. our metals recycling operations sell ferrous scrap to steel mills and foundries, and nonferrous scrap, such as copper, brass, aluminum and stainless steel to, among others, ingot manufacturers, copper refineries and mills, smelters, and specialty mills. our steel fabrication operations sell fabricated steel joists and deck primarily to the non-residential construction market. we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based on known credit risks, historical loss experience and current economic conditions affecting our customers. we mitigate our exposure to credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary, such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the receivable from our customer. if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowance may be required.
inventories.    we record inventories at lower of cost or market. cost is determined using a weighted average cost method for scrap, and on a first-in, first-out, basis for other inventory. we record amounts required, if any, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value as a charge to cost of goods sold. if product selling prices were to decline in future periods, further write-down of inventory could result, specifically raw material inventory such as scrap purchased during periods of peak market pricing. upon deciding to idle the minnesota ironmaking operations and to monetize existing raw material inventory, we recorded an inventory lower-of-cost or market charge of $21.0 million (inclusive of noncontrolling interests of $3.6 million), in cost of goods sold in the second quarter 2015.
impairments of long-lived tangible and definite-lived intangible assets.    we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. impairment losses are recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying amounts. the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount. we consider various factors and determine whether an impairment test is necessary, including by way of examples, a significant and prolonged deterioration in operating results and/or projected cash flows, significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, technological advances with respect to assets which would potentially render them obsolete, our strategy and capital planning, and the economic climate in markets to be served. when determining future cash flows and if necessary, fair value, we must make judgments as to the expected utilization of assets and estimated future cash flows related to those assets. we consider historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all other available information at the time the estimates are made. those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate.
a long-lived asset is classified as held for sale upon meeting specified criteria related to ability and intent to sell. an asset classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. as of december 31, 2015, the company reported $8.6 million of land and buildings as assets held for sale within other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet. an impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset held for sale to its fair value less cost to sell. upon the december 31, 2015, determination and classification of these assets as held for sale, the company recorded a $10.3 million asset impairment charge in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31, 2015. the company determined fair value using level 3 inputs as provided for under asc 820, consisting of information provided by brokers and other external sources along with management's own assumptions.
during the fourth quarter of 2014, our minnesota ironmaking operations reached a steady state, indicating a consistency in the operation's production capability, processes and cost structure, including the ability to utilize certain lower-cost raw materials. given this, we undertook an assessment of the
53
recoverability of the carrying value of our minnesota ironmaking operation's fixed assets. with our outlook at that time regarding future operating costs and product pricing, we concluded that the carrying value of these fixed assets was no longer fully recoverable, and the fixed assets were in fact impaired. this assessment resulted in a $260.0 million pretax non-cash impairment charge, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $46.5 million, which is reflected in "other" in note 13, segment information. the carrying values of the impaired assets were adjusted to their expected fair values as determined primarily on the cost approach, as well as expected future discounted cash flows income approach, using level 3 inputs under asc 820.
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets.
our goodwill relates to various business combinations, and is allocated to the following reporting units at december 31(in thousands):

at least once annually or when indicators of impairment exist, we perform an impairment test for goodwill. goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally one level below our operating segments. we utilize a two-stepped approach to measuring goodwill impairment. the first step of the test determines if there is potential goodwill impairment. in this step we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount (which includes goodwill). the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows utilizing a risk-adjusted discount rate to calculate the net present value of future cash flows (income approach), and by using a market approach based upon an analysis of valuation metrics of comparable peer companies. if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, we perform the second step of the test, which measures the amount of impairment loss to be recorded. in the second step, we compare the carrying amount of the goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill based on the net fair value of the recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. if the implied fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value.
key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the discounted cash flows method (income approach) include: (a) expected cash flows for the five-year period following the testing date (including market share, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce and estimated capital needs); (b) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit; and (c) a risk-adjusted discount rate based on management's best estimate of market participants' after-tax weighted average cost of capital and market risk premiums. key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the market approach include the expected revenues and cash flows in the next year. we consider historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair
54
values of its reporting units are estimated. those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate.
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in past transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on operating plans and economic conditions at the time of acquisition. consequently, if operating results and/or economic conditions deteriorate after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets. a deterioration of economic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models, but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and/or discount rates. additionally, we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. as a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed. therefore, we may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset or assets in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts.
our other indefinite-lived intangible assets relate to trade names acquired through various business combinations and is allocated to the following reporting units at december 31, (in thousands):

omnisourcemetals recycling operations segment       $39,500             $108,000
the techssteel operations segment                          81,800              81,800
$121,300            $189,800
at least annually or when indicators of impairment exist, we test for indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment through the comparison of the fair value of the specific intangible asset with its carrying amount. the fair value of the intangible asset is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows attributable to the asset and a risk-adjusted discount rate to compute a net present value of future cash flows. if the fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to the excess in carrying value.
during the fourth quarter of 2015, we determined that the fair value of omnisource was less than its carrying value, and upon the completion of the impairment analysis, that the goodwill and trade name assets were impaired. the decrease in omnisource fair value from our prior year impairment analysis was the result of a forecasted reduction in future cash flows based on management's view of the weaker longer-term global scrap commodity outlook. this outlook became clearer in the fourth quarter of 2015 from the longevity of: 1) the prolonged strength of the u.s. dollar decreasing scrap export volume (resulting in excess domestic supply); 2) currency devaluation contributing to china and russia supplying alternative scrap materials to turkey, versus those coming from the u.s.; and 3) slower global growth decreasing demand for scrap. while the scrap commodity outlook deteriorated throughout much of 2015, there were indicators of improvement during the year such as the restoration of the ratio of iron ore to scrap costs to a more historically consistent relationship, as well as a mid-year scrap pricing increase, versus the monthly decreases experienced throughout much of the year, including large decreases in both the first and fourth quarters. upon the fourth quarter decrease in selling prices and resulting metal spreads, we concluded that the impact of the factors noted above were longer-term, which resulted in our reassessment of our future long-term cash flows. the omnisource goodwill and trade name indefinite-lived intangible assets were written down to their respective fair values, resulting in pretax non-cash asset impairment charges of $341.3 million and $68.5 million, respectively, that are reflected in asset impairment charges in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31, 2015, within the metals recycling operations.
55
the 2015 annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analysis did not result in any impairment charges related to any other of our reporting units. management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that any of our reporting units will fail step one of a goodwill or indefinite-lived asset impairment test in the near term. we will continue to monitor operating results within all reporting units throughout the upcoming year in order to determine if events and circumstances warrant interim impairment testing. otherwise, all reporting units will again be subject to the required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2016. due to the inherent uncertainties involved in forecasting, changes in judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment, including expected future operating cash flows and discount rate, could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future, resulting in further impairments.
income taxes.    we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements. this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. we establish reserves to reduce some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain. we adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited by a taxing authority and finally resolved. the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. the tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the "more likely than not" recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears. settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data," in this annual report on form 10-k. this discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in item 1a, "risk factors" and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. (see "special note regarding forward-looking statements.")
critical accounting estimates and policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience, and evaluate them on an on-going basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. actual results could differ from those estimates. we discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis, and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this annual report on form 10-k. the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:
revenue recognition. we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. we derive revenue from three sources-sales of systems, spare parts and services. in general, we recognize revenue for systems when the system has been installed, is operating according to predetermined specifications and is accepted by the customer. when we have demonstrated a history of successful installation and acceptance, we recognize revenue upon delivery and customer acceptance. under certain circumstances, however, we recognize revenue prior to acceptance from the customer, as follows:
•   when the customer fab has previously accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and when we can objectively demonstrate that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria.
•   when system sales to independent distributors have no installation requirement, contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% payment is due based upon shipment.
•   when the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory.
•   when the customer withholds acceptance due to issues unrelated to product performance, in which case revenue is recognized when the system is performing as intended and meets predetermined specifications.
in circumstances in which we recognize revenue prior to installation, the portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation.
in many instances, products are sold in stand-alone arrangements. services are sold separately through renewals of annual maintenance contracts. we have multiple element revenue arrangements in cases where certain elements of a sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period. to determine the relative fair value of each element in a revenue arrangement, we allocate arrangement consideration based on the selling price hierarchy. for substantially all of the arrangements with multiple deliverables pertaining to products and services, we use vendor-specific objective evidence ("vsoe") or third-party evidence ("tpe") to allocate the selling price to each deliverable. we determine tpe based on historical prices charged for products and services when sold on a stand-alone basis. when we are unable to establish relative selling price using vsoe or tpe, we use estimated selling price ("esp") in our allocation of arrangement consideration. the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. esp could potentially be used for new or customized products. we regularly review relative selling prices and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates. in a multiple element revenue arrangement, we defer revenue recognition associated with the relative fair value of each undelivered element until that element is delivered to the customer. to be considered a separate element, the product or service in question must represent a separate unit of accounting, which means that such product or service must fulfill the following criteria: (a) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis; and (b) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. if the arrangement does not meet all the above criteria, the entire amount of the sales contract is deferred until all elements are accepted by the customer.
trade-in rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases. we estimate the value of the trade-in right and reduce the revenue recognized on the initial sale. this amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the trade-in right or the expiration of the trade-in right.
37
spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable.
service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract, including consulting and training revenue, is recognized when the related services are performed and collectibility is reasonably assured.
we sell stand-alone software that is subject to the software revenue recognition guidance. we periodically review selling prices to determine whether vsoe exists, and in situations where we are unable to establish vsoe for undelivered elements, such as post-contract service, revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the service contract.
we also defer the fair value of non-standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. non-standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for 12 months. non-standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences.
the deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment, less applicable product and warranty costs. deferred system revenue represents the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers which have not met our revenue recognition criteria. deferred system profit does not include the profit associated with product shipments to certain customers in japan, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. shipments to such customers in japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance.
we enter into sales arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services where certain elements of the sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period. judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. additionally, judgment is required to interpret various commercial terms and determine when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period. while changes in the allocation of the estimated selling price between the accounting units will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.
inventories. inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market. demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value. our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and spoilage are recognized as current period charges. we write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and service spare parts inventory based on forecasted usage. these factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values.
warranty. we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12 months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. utilizing actual service records, we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. we update these estimated charges on a regular basis. the actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly. see note 13, "commitments and contingencies" to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description.
allowance for doubtful accounts. a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. in order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition. an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable. the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. we take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer's inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. if circumstances change, such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to record additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income.
38
stock-based compensation. we account for stock-based awards granted to employees for services based on the fair value of those awards. the fair value of stock-based awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period. the fair value for restricted stock units granted without "dividend equivalent" rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units, adjusted to exclude the present value of dividends which are not accrued on the restricted stock units. the fair value for restricted stock units granted with "dividend equivalent" rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. the award holder is not entitled to receive payments under dividend equivalent rights unless the associated restricted stock unit award vests (i.e., the award holder is entitled to receive credits, payable in cash or shares of our common stock, equal to the cash dividends that would have been received on the shares of our common stock underlying the restricted stock units had the shares been issued and outstanding on the dividend record date, but such dividend equivalents are only paid subject to the recipient satisfying the vesting requirements of the underlying award). the fair value is determined using a black-scholes valuation model for purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan. the black-scholes option-pricing model requires the input of assumptions, including the option's expected term and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. the expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the market-based historical implied volatility from traded options of our common stock. we have elected not to include the indirect tax effects of stock-based compensation deductions when calculating the windfall benefits and therefore recognize the full effect of these deductions in the income statement in the period in which the taxable event occurs.
accounting for cash-based long-term incentive compensation. cash-based long-term incentive ("cash lti") awards issued to employees under our cash lti program vest in four equal installments, with 25% of the aggregate amount of the cash lti award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a four-year period. in order to receive payments under a cash lti award, participants must remain employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date. compensation expense related to the cash lti awards is recognized over the vesting term, which is adjusted for the impact of estimated forfeitures.
contingencies and litigation. we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. we accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. see note 13, "commitments and contingencies" and note 14, "litigation and other legal matters" to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description.
goodwill and intangible assets. we assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. long-lived intangible assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. see note 6, "goodwill and purchased intangible assets" to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. we performed our annual qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit in our second quarter of fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 and concluded that there was no impairment. there have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to our annual impairment test. the next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ending june 30, 2016.
if we were to encounter challenging economic conditions, such as a decline in our operating results, an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment, a substantial decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, we may be required to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. in addition, if such conditions have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets, we may be required to record goodwill and/or intangible asset impairment charges in future periods. it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would occur or, if it does, whether such charge would be material to our results of operations.
income taxes. we account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. the guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. we have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets, but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets. however, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets that are not subject to a valuation allowance, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets. this would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable.
39
on a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. we carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. if actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. in accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed within the interpretation. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
valuation of marketable securities. our investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as reported on our consolidated statements of stockholders' equity. however, changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or an impairment charge is recognized. realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security's cost basis. we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period during which any such determination is made. in making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration of the investment, the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, default and loss rates of the underlying collateral, structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist. our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.
effects of recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted in july 2013, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued an accounting standard update that provides guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists. under this accounting standard update, in most circumstances, an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in our financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward. this accounting standard update became effective for our interim period ended september 30, 2014, and its adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in june 2014, the fasb issued an accounting standard update regarding stock-based compensation that clarifies the accounting treatment when terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period ends. the update requires that a performance target that affects vesting that could be achieved after the requisite service period ends be treated as a performance condition. the update is effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending june 30, 2017, with early adoption permitted. we early adopted this accounting standard update in the third quarter of our fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in april 2015, the fasb issued accounting standards update regarding simplification of the presentation of debt issuance costs, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. the update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending june 30, 2017. earlier adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued and we are required to apply the guidance on a retrospective basis with additional disclosure requirements upon transition. we early adopted this accounting standard update in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
40
updates not yet effective in may 2014, the fasb issued an accounting standard update regarding revenue from customer contracts to transfer goods and services or non-financial assets, unless the contracts are covered by other standards (for example, insurance or lease contracts). under the new guidance, an entity should recognize revenue in connection with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. in addition, the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. the updates are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending june 30, 2018. in july 2015, the fasb announced a deferral of the effective date by one year, with early adoption on the original effective date permitted. the new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. we are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements.
in april 2015, the fasb issued an accounting standard update for customer's cloud based fees. the guidance changes what a customer must consider in determining whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license. if the arrangement contains a software license, the customer would account for the fees related to the software license element in accordance with guidance related to internal use software; if the arrangement does not contain a software license, the customer would account for the arrangement as a service contract. the update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending june 30, 2017, with early adoption permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements.
in july 2015, the fasb issued an accounting standard update for the subsequent measurement of inventory. the amended guidance requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. the requirement would replace the current lower of cost or market evaluation and the accounting guidance is unchanged for inventory measured using last-in, first-out ("lifo") or the retail inventory method. the update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending june 30, 2018, with early adoption permitted to be applied prospectively. we are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements.
executive summary kla-tencor corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries. our broad portfolio of defect inspection and metrology products, and related service, software and other offerings primarily supports integrated circuit ("ic" or "chip") manufacturers throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process, from research and development to final volume production. we provide leading-edge equipment, software and support that enable ic manufacturers to identify, resolve and manage significant advanced technology manufacturing process challenges and obtain higher finished product yields at lower overall cost. in addition to serving the semiconductor industry, we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries, including the led and data storage industries, as well as general materials research.
our products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer, ic, lithography reticle ("reticle" or "mask") and disk manufacturers around the world. our products, services and expertise are used by our customers to measure, detect, analyze and resolve critical product defects that arise in that environment in order to control nanometric level manufacturing processes. our revenues are driven largely by our customers' spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies, or to increase their production volumes in response to market demand. our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or more of the three major semiconductor markets - memory, foundry and logic. all three of these markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and sudden shifts in end-user demand, which influence the level and pattern of our customers' spending on our products and services. although capital spending in all three semiconductor markets has historically been very cyclical, the demand for more advanced and lower cost chips used in a growing number of consumer electronics, communications, data processing, and industrial and automotive products has resulted over the long term in a favorable demand environment for our process control and yield management solutions, particularly in the foundry and logic markets, which have higher levels of process control adoption than the memory market.
41
as we are a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries, our customer base continues to become more highly concentrated over time, thereby increasing the potential impact of a sudden change in capital spending by a major customer on our revenues and profitability. as our customer base becomes increasingly more concentrated, large orders from a relatively limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our sales, which potentially exposes us to more volatility for revenues and earnings. we are also subject to the cyclical capital spending that has historically characterized the semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries. the timing, length, intensity and volatility of the capacity-oriented capital spending cycles of our customers are unpredictable.
the semiconductor industry has also been characterized by constant technological innovation. the growing use of increasingly sophisticated semiconductor devices in mobile consumer products has caused many of our customers to invest in additional semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and capacity. on the other hand, higher design costs for the most advanced ics could economically constrain leading-edge manufacturing technology customers to focus their resources on only the large technologically advanced products and applications. we believe that, over the long term, our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications that fuel demand for process control equipment, although the growth for such equipment may be adversely impacted by higher design costs for advanced ics, reuse of installed products, and delays in production ramps by our customers in response to higher costs and technical challenges at more advanced technology nodes.
the demand for our products and our revenue levels are driven by our customers' needs to solve the process challenges that they face as they adopt new technologies required to fabricate advanced ics that are incorporated into sophisticated mobile devices. the timing for our customers in ordering and taking delivery of process control and yield management equipment is also determined by our customers' requirements to meet the next generation production ramp schedules, and the timing for capacity expansion to meet end customer demand. our earnings will depend not only on our revenue levels, but also on the amount of research and development spending required to meet our customers' technology roadmaps. we have maintained production volumes and capacity to meet anticipated customer requirements and remain at risk of incurring significant inventory-related and other restructuring charges if business conditions deteriorate. over the past year, our customers have taken delivery of lower volumes of process control equipment that we had expected. any delay or push out by our customers in taking delivery of process control and yield management equipment may cause earnings volatility, due to increases in the risk of inventory related charges as well as timing of revenue recognition due to expiration of credits or volume discounts, which, if not used by a stipulated time frame, will expire.
during the most recent quarter, we implemented a plan to reduce our global employee workforce aimed at streamlining our organization and business processes in response to the changing customer requirements in our industry. the goals of this reduction are to enable continued innovation, direct our resources toward our best opportunities and lower our ongoing expense run rate. we expect to substantially complete the global employee workforce reduction by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, but certain reductions will occur in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016.
the following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years:

total revenues during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 decreased by 4% compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014. revenue decreases from sales of both our defect inspection and metrology products for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 reflected our customers' decline in capital spending for process control equipment, due to shifts in the timing of the new technology ramps and capacity-related expansion plans.
total revenues during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 increased by 3% compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013, as our customers continued to invest in process control and services to improve manufacturing yields as they adopt advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules required to fabricate advanced ics.

product revenues our business is affected by the concentration of our customer base and our customers' capital equipment procurement schedules as a result of their investment plans. our product revenues in any particular period are significantly impacted by the amount of new orders that we receive during that period and, depending upon the duration of manufacturing and installation cycles, in the preceding period.
product revenues decreased by 7% in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014, primarily as a result of lower revenues from our customers in taiwan, certain countries in asia and europe and israel, partially offset by higher revenues from our customers in north america, korea and japan. the decline in revenues was impacted by the timing of development and new technology ramps of our customers as well as the lower shipments of our products, particularly to our foundry customers in taiwan, due to timing of capacity-related expansion plans.
product revenues increased by 2% in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013, as our customers increased their investments in defect inspection capabilities to address the yield challenges caused by the introduction of new technologies and architectures, and added production capacity to meet the growing needs for advanced ics demanded in an environment of rising global demand for mobile devices.
service revenues service revenues are generated from maintenance contracts, as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period. the amount of our service revenues is typically a function of the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers' sites and the utilization of those systems, but it is also impacted by other factors, such as our rate of service contract renewals, the types of systems being serviced and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. service revenues increased sequentially over the fiscal years ended june 30, 2013, 2014 and 2015, primarily as a result of an increase over time in the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers' sites over that time period.
revenues - top customers the following customers each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the indicated periods:

a significant portion of our revenues continues to be generated in asia, where a substantial portion of the world's semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located, and we expect that trend to continue.
gross margin our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products, including our ability to scale our operations efficiently and effectively in response to prevailing business conditions.
the following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin percentage:
gross margin percentage fiscal year ended june 30, 2013                         56.5   %
revenue volume of products and services                    -   %
mix of products and services sold                       (0.3   )%
manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies           0.2   %
other service and manufacturing costs                    1.5   %
fiscal year ended june 30, 2014                         57.9   %
revenue volume of products and services                 (1.1   )%
mix of products and services sold                        0.3   %
manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies          (0.6   )%
other service and manufacturing costs                    0.3   %
fiscal year ended june 30, 2015                         56.8   %
changes in gross margin percentage driven by revenue volume of products and services reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues. it also includes the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, average customer pricing and customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements. changes in gross margin percentage from mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes in the composition within product and service offerings. changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements; this includes the impact of capacity utilization, use of overtime and variability of cost structure. changes in gross margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs, including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers, and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk.
our gross margin decreased to 56.8% during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 from 57.9% during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014, primarily due to lower volume of products and services, as well as a reduction in manufacturing efficiencies driven by lower manufacturing output and severance-related expenses, a substantial amount of which is related to our global workforce reduction plan that we announced in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, refer to note 15, "restructuring charges" for additional details. the above decreases were partially offset by a favorable mix of products and services sold and efficiencies derived from other service and manufacturing costs.

our gross margin increased to 57.9% during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 from 56.5% during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013, primarily due to lower charges for inventory obsolescence as well as manufacturing and service efficiencies, partially offset by a less favorable mix of products and services sold.
engineering, research and development ("r&d")

r&amp;d expenses as a percentage of total revenues            19   %                18   %                17   %              1   %                   1               %
r&d expenses may fluctuate with product development phases and project timing as well as our focused r&d efforts that are aligned with our overall business strategy. historically, our r&d expenses have generally increased over time, primarily due to higher costs associated with advanced product and technology development projects. we incur significant costs associated with these projects, including compensation for engineering talent, engineering material costs, and other expenses, as technological innovation is essential to our success. one of the goals of our plan to reduce our global employee workforce is to streamline our organization and business processes and direct our resources toward our best opportunities.
r&d expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 were lower compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014, primarily due to a decrease in engineering materials and consulting costs of $19.8 million associated with the completion of major platform developments, a decrease in depreciation expense of $2.1 million and a decrease in travel expenses of $1.2 million. this was partially offset by an increase in employee-related expenses of $10.6 million mainly as a result of our severance-related expenses, a substantial amount of which is related to our global workforce reduction plan that we announced in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, refer to note 15, "restructuring charges" for additional details. in addition, the decrease was partially offset by a $6.3 million reduction in external funding used to offset the cost of r&d activities.
r&d expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013, primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses of $41.8 million as a result of hiring additional engineering talent and an increase in travel expenses of $2.6 million, as well as a $4.2 million reduction in external funding used to offset the cost of r&d activities.
r&d expenses include the benefit of $1.9 million, $8.2 million and $12.4 million of external funding received during the fiscal years ended june 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for certain strategic development programs, primarily from government grants.
our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. to do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial and focused investments in our research and development. we remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes.

sg&a expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014, primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses of $8.3 million mainly as a result of severance-related expenses, a substantial amount of which is related to our global workforce reduction plan that we announced in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 (refer to note 15, "restructuring charges" for additional details), an increase in cost of support for sales evaluation of $6.5 million, an increase in certain expenses of $2.5 million as a result of our one-time leveraged recapitalization expense that was completed in the three months ended december 31, 2014, a payment related to a contractual settlement for $2.0 million, an increase due to the impairment charge recorded for certain long-lived assets of $1.7 million and an increase in legal fees of $1.6 million. in addition, during the three months ended december 31, 2013, sg&a expenses were favorably impacted by our receipt of $1.1 million in proceeds from a class action settlement, as well as our recovery of $1.1 million in receivables that had previously been classified as a bad debt expense during the three months ended december 31, 2013, both of which resulted in a decrease of our sg&a expense for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014. the increases described above were partially offset by a decrease in travel related expenses of $4.3 million and a decrease in marketing-related expenses of $1.9 million.
sg&a expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 were slightly lower compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013, primarily due to lower levels of consulting expenses of $4.5 million and a decrease in amortization of intangible assets of $2.6 million as some intangible assets became fully amortized. this was partially offset by an increase in employee-related expenses of $4.4 million as a result of hiring additional personnel.
restructuring charges in april 2015, we announced a plan to reduce our global employee workforce to streamline our organization and business processes in response to changing customer requirement in our industry. the goals of this reduction are to enable continued innovation, direct our resources toward our best opportunities and lower our ongoing expense run rate. we expect to recognize significant cost savings from a number of activities we have recently undertaken, including estimated annual cost savings of approximately $100 million of employee related costs as a result of our announced global employee workforce reduction. during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, we recorded a $31.6 million net restructuring charge, of which $8.0 million was recorded to costs of revenues, $11.1 million to engineering, research and development expense and $12.5 million to selling, general and administrative expense. a net restructuring charge amounting to $22.4 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, a substantial majority of which was related to our global workforce reduction plan. refer to note 15, "restructuring charges" for additional details.
the following table shows the activity primarily related to accrual for severance and benefits expense for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015:

the accrual for severance and benefits as of june 30, 2015 is expected to be paid out by the end of our fiscal quarter ending december 31, 2015.
we expect to incur additional charges, including additional severance costs and other related costs, in connection with the completion of our global workforce reduction during the first two quarters of fiscal year 2016.

other expense (income), net                                     $(10,469      )          $(16,203   )          $(15,112   )
interest expense as a percentage of total revenues              4             %                 2   %                 2   %
other expense (income), net as a percentage of total revenues   -             %                 1   %                 1   %
the increase in interest expense during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 was primarily attributable to the issuance of $2.50 billion aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured long-term notes and entry into the $750 million unsecured prepayable term loan facility during the three months ended december 31, 2014, as compared to $750 million of 2018 senior notes for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014. the interest expense during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 remained relatively unchanged compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013.
other expense (income), net is comprised primarily of realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities, gains or losses from revaluations of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts, impairments associated with equity investments in privately-held companies, interest related accruals (such as interest and penalty accruals related to our tax obligations) and interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio. since june 30, 2014, our investment balance for our marketable securities portfolio declined by $973 million as a result of our strategic decision to liquidate certain marketable securities in our investment portfolio to fund our working capital requirements. with this decision, our interest income earned from our investment portfolio is expected to decline and the realized gains as a result of liquidation of our investment portfolio are not expected to recur.
the decrease in other expense (income), net during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 was primarily attributable to a net decline of $4.7 million in gains from the sale of equity investments in privately-held companies, a $1.1 million decrease in interest income from our investment portfolio as a result of our decision to liquidate certain marketable securities and a $1.1 million increase in net foreign currency losses resulting from the volatility of the foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar, which was partially offset by a decrease in an impairment charge of $1.0 million related to an equity investment in a privately-held company that was deemed to be other-than-temporary impairment and an increase of $0.9 million of realized gains from the investment portfolio liquidation.
the increase in other expense (income), net during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 was primarily attributable to an increase of $3.7 million gain from the sale of an equity investment in a privately-held company, partially offset by an impairment charge of $1.4 million recognized during the three months ended december 31, 2013 related to an equity investment in a privately-held company that was deemed to be other-than-temporary impairment, and a decrease in interest income of $1.3 million driven by lower interest rates.
loss on extinguishment of debt and other, net for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, loss on extinguishment of debt and other, net, reflected a pre-tax net loss of $131.7 million associated with the redemption of our $750 million of 2018 senior notes during the three months ended december 31, 2014. included in the loss on extinguishment of debt and other, net is the $1.2 million gain on the non-designated forward contract that was entered into by us in anticipation of the redemption of the 2018 senior notes, which were redeemed during the three months ended december 31, 2014. refer to "note 7, debt" and "note 16, derivative instruments and hedging activities" for further details. we had no loss on extinguishment of debt and other, net, in the fiscal years ended june 30, 2014 and 2013.

income before income taxes         $434,131              $734,461              $690,621
provision for income taxes          $67,973              $151,706              $147,472
effective tax rate                     15.7   %              20.7   %              21.4   %
the provision for income taxes differs from the statutory u.s. federal rate primarily due to foreign income with lower tax rates, tax credits, and other domestic incentives.
tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 was 15.7% compared to 20.7% for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014. tax expense as a percentage of income decreased primarily due to an increase in our research and development credits, an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction as a percentage of income, and a decrease in the percentage of income earned in the u.s. as a result of the loss on extinguishment of debt compared to income earned outside the u.s. in jurisdictions with lower tax rates.
tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 was 20.7% compared to 21.4% for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013. tax expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in tax reserves and an increase in the percentage of our revenues that were earned outside the u.s. in jurisdictions with lower tax rates, partially offset by a decrease in our research and development credits and an increase in tax expense related to employee stock activity.
our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, the amount of our pre-tax income as business activities fluctuate, non-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income, the domestic manufacturing deduction, non-taxable or non-deductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our executive deferred savings plan, the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.
in the normal course of business, we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against us. we are under a united states federal income tax examination for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.

as of june 30, 2015, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.39 billion, which is a decrease of $766 million from june 30, 2014. the decrease is primarily attributable to payment of a special cash dividend of approximately $2.72 billion, payment of regular quarterly cash dividends of $324.8 million, payment for the redemption of our 2018 senior notes of $877.4 million, payment for stock repurchases of $602.9 million, payment of principal amount and prepayment of term loans and interest with respect to senior notes, term loans and unfunded revolving credit facility aggregating to $98.3 million, payment of interest up to the redemption date with respect to our 2018 senior notes of $32.8 million, partially offset by net proceeds of an aggregate of $3.22 billion from our issuance of senior notes, borrowings under our five-year senior unsecured prepayable term loans under our credit facility, and net proceeds from cash generated from operating activities. as of june 30, 2015, $1.47 billion of our $2.39 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. we currently intend to permanently reinvest $1.34 billion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. if, however, a portion of these funds were to be repatriated to the united states, we would be required to accrue and pay u.s. and foreign taxes of approximately 30%-50% of the funds repatriated. the amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation, as well as the location from which the funds are repatriated. we have accrued (but have not paid) u.s. taxes on the remaining cash of $136.3 million of the $1.47 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. as such, these funds can be returned to the u.s. without accruing any additional u.s. tax expense.
cash dividends and special cash dividend:
the total amount of regular quarterly cash dividends paid during the fiscal years ended june 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $324.8 million, $298.9 million and $265.9 million, respectively. the increase in the amount of regular quarterly cash dividends paid during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 reflected the increase in the level of our regular quarterly cash dividend from $0.45 to $0.50 per share that was instituted during the three months ended september 30, 2014. the amount of accrued dividends payable for regular quarterly cash dividends on unvested restricted stock units with dividend equivalent rights was $0.9 million as of june 30, 2015. we did not have accrued dividends payable in the fiscal years ended june 30, 2014 and 2013. these amounts will be paid upon vesting of the underlying unvested restricted stock units as described in note 8, "equity and long-term incentive compensation plans." on july 14, 2015, we announced that our board of directors had authorized a further increase in the level of our quarterly cash dividend from $0.50 to $0.52 per share. refer to note 19, "subsequent events" for additional information regarding the quarterly cash dividend increase announced subsequent to june 30, 2015.
49
on november 19, 2014, we declared a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share on our outstanding common stock which was paid on december 9, 2014 to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on december 1, 2014. additionally, in connection with the special cash dividend, our board of directors and our compensation committee of our board of directors approved a proportionate and equitable adjustment to outstanding equity awards (restricted stock units and stock options) under the 2004 equity incentive plan (the "2004 plan"), as required by the 2004 plan, subject to the vesting requirements of the underlying awards. as the adjustment was required by the 2004 plan, the adjustment to the outstanding awards did not result in any incremental compensation expense due to modification of such awards, under the authoritative guidance. the declaration and payment of the special cash dividend was part of our leveraged recapitalization transaction under which the special cash dividend was financed through a combination of existing cash and proceeds from the debt financing disclosed in note 7, "debt" that was completed during the three months ended december 31, 2014. the total amount of the special cash dividend accrued by the company during the three months ended december 31, 2014 was approximately $2.76 billion, substantially all of which was paid out during the three months ended december 31, 2014. as of june 30, 2015, we have $41.1 million accrued dividends payable for the special cash dividend with respect to outstanding unvested restricted stock units, which will be paid when such underlying unvested restricted stock units vest as described in detail in note 8, "equity and long-term incentive compensation plans." we did not declare any special cash dividend in the fiscal years ended june 30, 2014 and 2013. other than the special cash dividend declared during the three months ended december 31, 2014, we historically have not declared any special cash dividends.
stock repurchases:
the shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have decreased our basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014. the stock repurchase program is intended, in part, to offset shares issued in connection with the purchases under our espp program, the vesting of employee restricted stock units and the exercise of employee stock options.
fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014
cash flows from operating activities:

•   a decrease of cash collections by approximately $270 million during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014,
•   an increase of debt-related interest payments of approximately $40 million during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014,

net cash provided by investing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 increased to $918 million compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 from net cash used in investing activities of $676 million, primarily as a result of an increase in the proceeds from sale of available-for-sale and trading securities, net of sales and maturities, of approximately $964 million during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, compared to the purchases of available-for-sale and trading securities, net of sales and maturities, of approximately $593 million during fiscal year ended june 30,  2014. in addition, we acquired a privately-held company for a total purchase consideration of $18 million in cash during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014.
50
cash flows from financing activities:
net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014, from $459 million to $1.30 billion, primarily as a result of the following key factors:
•   an increase in dividend payments of $2.74 billion during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014, reflecting the payments for the special cash dividend during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 and an increase in our quarterly dividend payout amount from $0.45 to $0.50 per share that was instituted during the three months ended september 30, 2014,

•   an increase in common stock repurchases of $362 million during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 and
•   a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $65 million during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014, partially offset by
•   net proceeds of $3.22 billion from issuance of senior notes and the term loans during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015.
fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013
cash flows from operating activities:
net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013, from $913 million to $779 million primarily as a result of the following key factors:
•   an increase in payroll of approximately $44 million during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013,
•   an increase in accounts payable payments of approximately $39 million during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013,
•   an increase in income tax and other tax payments of approximately $19 million during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 and
•   payments of approximately $15 million upon vesting of cash lti awards during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 under our cash lti employee compensation plan, whereas no such payments occurred during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013.
cash flows from investing activities:
net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 from $241 million to $676 million, primarily as a result of an increase in the use of cash for purchases of available-for-sale and trading securities, net of sales and maturities, of approximately $424 million during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013. in addition, we acquired a privately-held company for a total purchase consideration of $18 million in cash during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014.
cash flows from financing activities:
net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013 from $429 million to $459 million, primarily as a result of the following key factors:
•   an increase in dividend payments of $33 million during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013, mainly due to an increase in the quarterly dividend payout amount that we announced in july 2013, and
•   a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $14 million during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013, partially offset by
•   a decrease in common stock repurchases of $32 million during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2013.
51
debt issuance - senior notes:
in november 2014, we issued $2.50 billion aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured long-term notes (collectively referred to as "senior notes"). we issued the senior notes as part of the leveraged recapitalization plan under which the proceeds from the senior notes in conjunction with the proceeds from the term loans (described below) and cash on hand were used (x) to fund a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share, aggregating to approximately $2.76 billion, (y) to redeem $750 million of 2018 senior notes, including associated redemption premiums, accrued interest and other fees and expenses and (z) for other general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares pursuant to our stock repurchase program. the interest rate specified for each series of the senior notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time if moody's investor service, inc. ("moody's") or standard & poor's ratings services ("s&p") or, under certain circumstances, a substitute rating agency selected by us as a replacement for moody's or s&p, as the case may be (a "substitute rating agency"), downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) its rating assigned to the respective series of senior notes such that the adjusted rating is below investment grade. if the adjusted rating of any series of senior notes from moody's (or, if applicable, any substitute rating agency) is decreased to ba1, ba2, ba3 or b1 or below, the stated interest rate on such series of senior notes as noted above will increase by 25 bps, 50 bps, 75 bps or 100 bps, respectively ("bps" refers to basis points and 1% is equal to 100 bps). if the rating of any series of senior notes from s&p (or, if applicable, any substitute rating agency) with respect to such series of senior notes is decreased to bb+, bb, bb- or b+ or below, the stated interest rate on such series of senior notes as noted above will increase by 25 bps, 50 bps, 75 bps or 100 bps, respectively. the interest rates on any series of senior notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any of moody's, s&p and, if applicable, any substitute rating agency) if such series of senior notes becomes rated "baa1" (or its equivalent) or higher by moody's (or, if applicable, any substitute rating agency) and "bbb+" (or its equivalent) or higher by s&p (or, if applicable, any substitute rating agency), or one of those ratings if rated by only one of moody's, s&p and, if applicable, any substitute rating agency, in each case with a stable or positive outlook. in october 2014, we entered into a series of forward contracts to lock the 10-year treasury rate ("benchmark rate") on a portion of the senior notes with a notional amount of $1.00 billion in aggregate. for additional details, refer to note 16, "derivative instruments and hedging activities."
the original discount on the senior notes amounted to $4.0 million and is being amortized over the life of the debt. interest is payable semi-annually on may 1 and november 1 of each year. the debt indenture (the "indenture") includes covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on its facilities and enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to certain allowances under which certain sale and leaseback transactions are not restricted. as of june 30, 2015, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the indenture associated with the senior notes.
debt issuance - credit facility (term loans and unfunded revolving credit facility):
in november 2014, we entered into $750 million of five-year senior unsecured prepayable term loans and a $500 million unfunded revolving credit facility (collectively, the "credit facility") under the credit agreement. the interest under the credit facility will be payable on the borrowed amounts at the london interbank offered rate ("libor") plus a spread, which is currently 125 bps, and this spread is subject to adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades by moody's and s&p. the spread ranges from 100 bps to 175 bps based on the then effective credit rating. we are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee of 15 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility, which is also subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades. the annual commitment fee ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility, depending upon the then effective credit rating. principal payments with respect to the term loans will be made on the last day of each calendar quarter and any unpaid principal balance of the term loans, including accrued interest, shall be payable on november 14, 2019 (the "maturity date"). we may prepay the term loans and unfunded revolving credit facility at any time without a prepayment penalty. during the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, the company prepaid additional principal of $20.0 million in addition to the scheduled quarterly payments for the term loans.
future principal payments for the term loans (without giving effect for any prepayments made) as of june 30, 2015, are as follows:
fiscal quarters ending                           quarterly payment(in thousands)
june 30, 2015 through december 31, 2016                      $9,375
march 31, 2017 through december 31, 2017                    $14,063
march 31, 2018 through september 30, 2019                   $18,750
december 31, 2019                                          $487,500
52
the credit facility requires us to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio as described in the credit agreement, on a quarterly basis, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters of no less than 3.50 to 1.00. in addition, we are required to maintain the maximum leverage ratio as described in the credit agreement, on a quarterly basis, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters for the fiscal quarters as described below.
fiscal quarters ending                      maximum leverage ratio june 30, 2015                                            4.25:1.00
september 30, 2015 and december 31, 2015                 4.00:1.00

december 31, 2016 and march 31, 2017                     3.50:1.00
thereafter                                               3.00:1.00
we were in compliance with the financial covenants under the credit agreement as of june 30, 2015 (the interest expense coverage ratio was 7.93 to 1.00 and the leverage ratio was 3.82 to 1.00) and had no outstanding borrowings under the unfunded revolving credit facility. considering our current liquidity position, short-term financial forecasts and ability to prepay the term loans, if necessary, we expect to continue to be in compliance with our financial covenants at the end of our first quarter of fiscal year ending june 30, 2016.
debt redemption:
in december 2014, we redeemed the $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2018 senior notes. the redemption resulted in a pre-tax net loss on extinguishment of debt of $131.7 million for the three months ended december 31, 2014, which includes $1.2 million of gain upon the termination of the non-designated forward contract described below.
in addition, in november 2014, we entered into a non-designated forward contract to lock the treasury rate to be used for determining the redemption amount in connection with our redemption of the then outstanding 2018 senior notes that occurred during the three months ended december 31, 2014. the notional amount of the non-designated forward contract was $750 million. for additional details, refer to note 16, "derivative instruments and hedging activities."

__________________
(1)   in november 2014, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of term loans due in fiscal year 2020 (outstanding balance of $711.3 million as of june 30, 2015) and $2.50 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2035.
(2)   the interest payments associated with the senior notes obligations included in the table above are based on the principal amount multiplied by the applicable coupon rate for each series of senior notes. our future interest payments are subject to change if our then effective credit rating is below investment grade as discussed above. the interest payments under the term loans are payable on the borrowed amounts at the libor plus 125 bps. as of june 30, 2015, we utilized the existing interest rates to project our estimated term loans interest payments for the next five years. the interest payment under the revolving credit facility for the undrawn balance is payable at 15 bps as a commitment fee based on the daily undrawn balance and we utilized the existing rate for the projected interest payments included in the table above. our future interest payments for the term loans and the revolving credit facility are subject to change due to future fluctuations in the libor rates as well as any upgrades or downgrades to our then effective credit rating.
(3)   represents an estimate of significant commitments to purchase inventory from our suppliers as well as an estimate of significant purchase commitments associated with other goods and services in the ordinary course of business. our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. this forecasted time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. in addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.
(4)   represents the estimated income tax payable obligation related to uncertain tax positions as well as related accrued interest. we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.
(5)   represents the amount committed under our cash long-term incentive program. the expected payment after estimated forfeitures is approximately $101.8 million.
(6)   represents the amount committed under our non-qualified executive deferred compensation plan. we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to the uncertainties in the timing around participant's separation and any potential changes that participants may decide to make to the previous distribution elections.

starting in fiscal year 2013 we adopted a cash-based long-term incentive ("cash lti") program for many of our employees as part of our employee compensation program. cash lti awards issued to employees under the cash long-term incentive plan ("cash lti plan") generally vest in four equal installments, with 25% of the aggregate amount of the cash lti award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a four-year period. in order to receive payments under the cash lti plan, participants must remain employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date.
we have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. in addition, we periodically sell certain letters of credit ("lcs"), without recourse, received from customers in payment for goods.
the following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of lcs for the indicated periods:

factoring and lc fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in other expense (income), net and were not material for the periods presented.
we maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to $22.5 million, of which $19.0 million had been issued as of june 30, 2015, primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for value-added tax ("vat") and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in europe and asia.
we maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply for key components. our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. this forecasted time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. our open inventory purchase commitments were approximately $298.7 million as of june 30, 2015 and are primarily due within the next 12 months. actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. in addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.
we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12 months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. the actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly. the difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; our warranty charge estimates for more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable. non-standard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40-hours per week coverage for 12 months. see note 13, "commitments and contingencies" to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description.
working capital:
working capital was $2.90 billion as of june 30, 2015, which was a decrease of $787.7 million compared to our working capital as of june 30, 2014. the decrease in working capital is primarily attributable to payment of a special cash dividend of approximately $2.72 billion, payment of regular quarterly cash dividends of $324.8 million, payment for the redemption of the 2018 senior notes of $877.4 million, payment for stock repurchases of $602.9 million, payment of principal amount and prepayment of term loans and interest with respect to senior notes, term loans and unfunded revolving credit facility aggregating to $98.3 million, payment of interest up to the redemption date with respect to our 2018 senior notes of $32.8 million, partially offset by the aggregate of net proceeds of $3.22 billion from the issuance of senior notes and borrowings under our prepayable term loans. as of june 30, 2015, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $2.39 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global and regional economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries. although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents balances and our $500 million unfunded revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements associated with working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividends, stock repurchases and other contractual obligations, including repayment of outstanding debt, for at least the next 12 months.

off-balance sheet arrangements under our foreign currency risk management strategy, we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. this financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. we continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months (see note 16, "derivative instruments and hedging activities" to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description). our outstanding hedge contracts, with maximum maturity of 16 months, were as follows:

in october 2014, in anticipation of the issuance of the senior notes, we entered into a series of forward contracts ("rate lock agreements") to lock the benchmark rate on a portion of the senior notes. the objective of the rate lock agreements was to hedge the risk associated with the variability in interest rates due to the changes in the benchmark rate leading up to the closing of the intended financing, on the notional amount being hedged. the rate lock agreements had a notional amount of $1 billion in aggregate which matured in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015. we designated each of the rate lock agreements as a qualifying hedging instrument and accounted for as a cash flow hedge, under which the effective portion of the gain or loss on the close out of the rate lock agreements was initially recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a reduction of total stockholders' equity and subsequently amortized into earnings as a component of interest expense over the term of the underlying debt. the ineffective portion, if any, was recognized in earnings immediately. the rate lock agreements were terminated on the date of pricing of the $1.25 billion of 4.650% senior notes due in 2024 and we recorded the fair value of a $7.5 million receivable as a gain within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of december 31, 2014. for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, we recognized $0.5 million for the amortization of the gain recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which amount reduced the interest expense. we did not record any ineffectiveness for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015. the cash proceeds of $7.5 million from the settlement of the rate lock agreements were included in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 because the designated hedged item was classified as interest expense in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
in addition, in november 2014, we entered into a non-designated forward contract to lock the treasury rate used to determine the redemption amount of the 2018 senior notes that occurred during the three months ended december 31, 2014. the objective of the forward contract was to hedge the risk associated with the variability of the redemption amount due to changes in interest rates through the redemption of the existing 2018 senior notes. the forward contract had a notional amount of $750 million. the forward contract was terminated in december 2014 and the resulting fair value of $1.2 million receivable was included in the loss on extinguishment of debt and other, net line in the consolidated statements of operations, partially offsetting the loss on redemption of the debt during the three months ended december 31, 2014. the cash proceeds from the forward contract were included in the cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, partially offsetting the cash outflows for the redemption of the 2018 senior notes.

indemnification obligations. subject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors, officers and employees with respect to certain litigation matters and investigations that arise in connection with their service to us. these obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, applicable contracts, and delaware and california law. the obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals' reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters. for example, we have paid or reimbursed legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government inquiries by a number of our current and former directors, officers and employees. although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under the indemnification obligations generally described in this paragraph is theoretically unlimited, we believe the fair value of this liability, to the extent estimable, is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings.
we are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. typically, these obligations arise in connection with contracts and license agreements or the sale of assets, under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from, or provide customers with other remedies to protect against, bodily injury or damage to personal property caused by our products, non-compliance with our product performance specifications, infringement of third-party intellectual property rights used in our products and a breach of warranties, representations and covenants related to matters such as title to assets sold, validity of certain intellectual property rights, non-infringement of third-party rights, and certain income tax-related matters. in each of these circumstances, payment by us is typically subject to the other party making a claim to and cooperating with us pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. this usually allows us to challenge the other party's claims or, in case of breach of intellectual property representations or covenants, to control the defense or settlement of any third-party claims brought against the other party. further, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of amounts, activity (typically at our option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund to the other party), and duration. in some instances, we may have recourse against third parties and/or insurance covering certain payments made by us.
in addition, we may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain customer-specific commitments on pricing, tool reliability, spare parts stocking levels, service response time and other commitments. furthermore, we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments. if a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights, we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection, as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection. to date, we have made no accruals in our consolidated financial statements for this contingency. while we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments, we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future.
it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

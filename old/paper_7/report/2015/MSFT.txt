item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following managements discussion and analysis (md&a) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of microsoft corporation. md&a is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to financial statements.
overview microsoft is a technology leader focused on building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world. we strive to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. we develop and market software, services, and devices that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to peoples lives.
we generate revenue by developing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products, by offering an array of services, including cloud-based services to consumers and businesses, by designing, manufacturing, and selling devices that integrate with our cloud-based services, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees, designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services, datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services, and income taxes.
much of our focus in fiscal year 2015 was toward transforming our organization to support our strategy of building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world. we achieved product development milestones, implemented organizational changes, and made strategic and tactical moves to support the three central ambitions that support our strategy: reinventing productivity and business processes; building the intelligent cloud platform; and creating more personal computing.
highlights from fiscal year 2015 included:
   momentum continued to grow in our commercial cloud and productivity offerings as we surpassed an $8 billion annualized run rate* at the end of the year.

   office 365 commercial seats grew 74%, and office 365 is now deployed in four out of five fortune 500 enterprises, with more than half of that install base using premium workloads. we also added over 50,000 small- and medium-sized business customers each month.

      server products and services revenue increased 9%, driven by growth across our cloud and on-premises server products. azure revenue and compute usage increased by triple digits in the fourth quarter year over year, and we ended fiscal year 2015 with more than 17,000 enterprise mobility services customers.

*   annualized run rate was calculated by multiplying june 2015 revenue by twelve months.

part ii item 7
   we reached over 8 million paid dynamics seats and refreshed and enhanced microsoft dynamics erp products. we also introduced new social, productivity, mobility, customer service, and marketing capabilities in dynamics crm.

   we currently have more than 15 million office 365 consumer subscribers, with new customers signing up at a current pace of nearly one million per month.
we also surpassed 150 million downloads of office mobile to ios and android devices.

   bing exceeded 20% u.s. market share as we focused our advertising business on search. in june 2015, we entered into agreements with aol and appnexus to outsource our display sales efforts.

   in hardware, we released surface 3 and expanded distribution of surface pro and the related gross margin percentage grew with increased revenue, and introduced new categories like hololens  all with an eye toward generating new growth in windows more broadly.

   xbox console volumes grew to over 12 million, and xbox live users increased 22%.

   we shipped over 36 million lumia units, and announced the restructuring of our phone hardware business to run it more effectively near-term while driving reinvention longer term.

   we completed 16 acquisitions, including mojang synergies ab (mojang), the swedish video game developer of the minecraft gaming franchise, and others, to strengthen our cloud platform and invest in mobile applications.

   we advanced windows 10 to the threshold of its launch in july 2015 with the help of the windows insider program, a new paradigm to incorporate unprecedented levels of user and developer feedback in our development process.

industry trends our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. at microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers, industry trends, and competitive forces.
economic conditions, challenges, and risks the market for software, devices, and cloud-based services is dynamic and highly competitive. our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. the devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the users choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. we must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. the investments we are making in devices and infrastructure will increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.
our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. we hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. microsoft competes for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow ones career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.
our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. as a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. recently, the significant strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies has negatively impacted reported revenue and reduced reported expenses from our international operations.

see a discussion of these factors and other risks under risk factors (part i, item 1a of this form 10-k).
seasonality our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. our computing and gaming hardware segment is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. typically, the computing and gaming hardware segment has generated approximately 40-50% of its yearly revenue in our second fiscal quarter.
unearned revenue quarterly and annual revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue, including:
   revenue deferred on pre-sales of windows to original equipment manufacturers (oems) and retailers before general availability.

   revenue deferred on bundled products and services (bundled offerings).

   revenue deferred on sales of windows 7 with an option to upgrade to windows 8 pro at a discounted price (the windows upgrade offer).

if our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.
reportable segments the segment amounts included in md&a are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. segment information appearing in note 22  segment information and geographic data of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) is also presented on this basis. all differences between our internal management reporting basis and accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (u.s. gaap), along with certain corporate-level and other activity, are included in corporate and other. operating expenses are not allocated to our segments. we have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flows.

dividends and interest income increased due to higher portfolio balances. interest expense increased due to higher outstanding long-term debt. net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to higher gains on sales of equity securities and lower other-than-temporary impairments. other-than-temporary impairments were $106 million in fiscal year 2014, compared with $208 million in fiscal year 2013. net losses on derivatives increased due to higher losses on foreign exchange contracts, losses on equity derivatives as compared to gains in the prior period, offset in part by gains on commodity and interest rate derivatives as compared to losses in the prior period. for fiscal year 2014, other reflects recognized losses from certain joint ventures, offset in part by a recognized gain on a divestiture. for fiscal year 2013, other reflects recognized gains on divestitures, including the gain recognized upon the divestiture of our 50% share in the msnbc joint venture.
income taxes fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014
our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 was approximately 34% and 21%, respectively. the fiscal year 2015 effective rate increased by 13%, primarily due to goodwill and asset impairments and restructuring charges recorded in fiscal year 2015, most of which did not generate a tax benefit. our effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico. in fiscal year 2015, this reduction was mostly offset by losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit, primarily as a result of impairment and restructuring charges.

changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax rates and resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services. we supply our windows pc operating system to customers through our u.s. regional operating center, while we supply the microsoft office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, our u.s. income before income taxes was $7.4 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively, and comprised 40% and 26%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, our foreign income before income taxes was $11.1 billion and $20.7 billion, respectively, and comprised 60% and 74%, respectively, of our income before income taxes.
tax contingencies and other income tax liabilities were $12.1 billion and $10.4 billion as of june 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. this increase relates primarily to adjustments to prior years liabilities for intercompany transfer pricing and adjustments related to our irs audits. while we settled a portion of the i.r.s. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for those years. in february 2012, the i.r.s. withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. as of june 30, 2015, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. we also continue to be subject to examination by the i.r.s. for tax years 2007 to 2015.
we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2015, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.
fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013
our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 was approximately 21% and 19%, respectively. our effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico.
our fiscal year 2014 effective rate increased by 2% from fiscal year 2013 mainly due to adjustments of $458 million to prior years liabilities for intercompany transfer pricing that increased taxable income in more highly taxed jurisdictions, as well as losses incurred by nds and changes in the geographic mix of our business. this was offset in part by favorable transfer pricing developments in certain foreign tax jurisdictions, primarily denmark.
changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax rates and resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services. we supply our windows pc operating system to customers through our u.s. regional operating center, while we supply the microsoft office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. windows pc operating system revenue decreased $655 million in fiscal year 2014, while microsoft office system and server products and tools revenue increased $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, during this same period. in fiscal years 2014 and 2013, our u.s. income before income taxes was $7.1 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively, and comprised 26% and 25%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. in fiscal years 2014 and 2013, the foreign income before income taxes was $20.7 billion and $20.4 billion, respectively, and comprised 74% and 75%, respectively, of our income before income taxes.

preservation. they consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. the investments are predominantly u.s. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. the credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.
of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at june 30, 2015, $94.4 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects. the amount of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was $2.1 billion. as of june 30, 2015, approximately 79% of the cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in u.s. government and agency securities, approximately 5% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of u.s. companies, and approximately 5% were invested in u.s. mortgage- and asset-backed securities, all of which are denominated in u.s. dollars.
securities lending we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. our securities lending payable balance was $92 million as of june 30, 2015. our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the fiscal year were $287 million and $750 million, respectively. intra-year variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities.
valuation in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and u.s. government securities. if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, common and preferred stock, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, u.s. government and agency securities, and certificates of deposit. level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. our broker-priced investments are generally classified as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. in addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. these controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.

cash flows fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014
cash flows from operations decreased $3.2 billion during the fiscal year to $29.1 billion, mainly due to an increase in materials and production costs in support of sales growth as well as payments related to restructuring charges and other changes in working capital, offset in part by increases in cash received from customers. cash used in financing increased $686 million to $9.1 billion, mainly due to a $7.1 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases, offset in part by a $6.7 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments. cash used in investing increased $4.2 billion to $23.0 billion, mainly due to a $5.5 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, partially offset by a $2.2 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies and purchases of intangible and other assets.
fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013
cash flows from operations increased $3.4 billion during fiscal year 2014 to $32.2 billion, mainly due to increases in cash received from customers. cash used in financing increased $246 million to $8.4 billion, mainly due to a $2.0 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases, a $1.4 billion increase in dividends paid, and a $324 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock, offset in part by a $3.4 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments. cash used in investing decreased $5.0 billion to $18.8 billion, mainly due to a $10.5 billion decrease in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, offset in part by a $4.4 billion increase in cash used for acquisition of companies and purchases of intangible and other assets, and a $1.2 billion increase in capital expenditures for property and equipment.
debt we issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. the proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. see note 12  debt of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further discussion.
unearned revenue unearned revenue at june 30, 2015 was comprised mainly of unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. unearned revenue at june 30, 2015 also included payments for: post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; xbox live subscriptions and prepaid points; microsoft dynamics business solutions products; office 365 subscriptions; skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; bundled offerings; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
the following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of june 30, 2015:

share repurchases on september 16, 2013, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases. the share repurchase program became effective on october 1, 2013, has no expiration date, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. while the program has no expiration date, we intend to complete it by december 31, 2016. as of june 30, 2015, $21.9 billion remained of our $40.0 billion share repurchase program.
during fiscal year 2015, we repurchased 295 million shares of microsoft common stock for $13.2 billion under the share repurchase program approved by our board of directors on september 16, 2013. during fiscal year 2014, we repurchased 175 million shares for $6.4 billion; 128 million shares were repurchased for $4.9 billion under the share repurchase program approved by our board of directors on september 16, 2013, and 47 million shares were repurchased for $1.5 billion under the share repurchase program that was announced on september 22, 2008 and expired september 30, 2013. during fiscal year 2013, we repurchased 158 million shares for $4.6 billion, under the share repurchase program announced on september 22, 2008. all repurchases were made using cash resources.
dividends see note 19  stockholders equity of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) for further discussion.
off-balance sheet arrangements we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. in evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. these obligations did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of june 30, 2015:
(in millions)                     2016                  2017-2018      2019-2020       thereafter          total long-term debt: (a)

other planned uses of capital we will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. we expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years in support of our productivity and platform strategy. we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
liquidity we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the u.s., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. as a result, as discussed above under cash, cash equivalents, and investments, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. we expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt maturities, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. in addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
should we require more capital in the u.s. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the u.s. through debt or equity issuances. these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or dilution of our earnings. we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates.
recent accounting guidance see note 1  accounting policies of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) for further discussion.
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are affected by managements application of accounting policies. critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.
revenue recognition revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.
judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products and are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period.
46
part ii item 7
software updates are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered. if it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (pcs) is being provided, revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied pcs term. if updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available.
microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under u.s. gaap, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. we use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (vsoe), (ii) third-party evidence, and (iii) best estimate of selling price (esp). for software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of vsoe in establishing fair value. generally, vsoe is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. esps are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. our process for determining esps requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable.
in january 2015, we announced windows 10 will be free to all qualified existing users of windows 7 and windows 8.1. this offer differs from historical offers preceding the launch of new versions of windows as it is being made available for free to existing users in addition to new customers after the offer announcement. we evaluated the nature and accounting treatment of the windows 10 offer and determined that it represents a marketing and promotional activity, in part because the offer is being made available for free to existing users. as this is a marketing and promotional activity, revenue recognition of new sales of windows 8 will continue to be recognized as delivered.
impairment of investment securities we review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. for fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
goodwill we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a
47
part ii item 7
discounted cash flow methodology. this analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.
the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
based on the results of our annual goodwill impairment testing as of may 1, 2015, we determined that goodwill associated with our phone hardware reporting unit was impaired, resulting in a material charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. as of june 30, 2015, none of our reporting units were considered to be at risk of impairment.
research and development costs costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
legal and other contingencies the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.

part ii item 7
inventories inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. these reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. the determination of market value and the estimated volume of demand used in the lower of cost or market analysis require significant judgment.

part ii item 7
statement of managements responsibility for financial statements management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. the consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on managements estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.
the company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. these systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.
the company engaged deloitte & touche llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).
the board of directors, through its audit committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. deloitte & touche llp and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the audit committee.

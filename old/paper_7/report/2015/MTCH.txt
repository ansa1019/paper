management overview iac is a leading media and internet company comprised of some of the world's most recognized brands and products, such as homeadvisor, vimeo, about.com, dictionary.com, the daily beast, investopedia, and match group's online dating portfolio, which includes match, okcupid, tinder and plentyoffish.
sources of revenue match group's dating revenue is substantially derived directly from users in the form of recurring membership fees, which typically provide unlimited access to a bundle of features for a specific period of time, and the balances from à la carte features, where users pay a fee for a specific action or event; with additional revenue generated from online advertisers who pay to reach our large audiences. non-dating revenue is primarily earned from fees received for in-person and online test preparation classes, access to online test preparation materials and individual tutoring services.
homeadvisor's revenue is derived primarily from fees paid by members of its network of home services professionals for consumer leads and memberships.
substantially all of the revenue from our publishing and applications segments is derived from online advertising. most of the company's online advertising revenue is attributable to our services agreement with google inc. ("google"). on october 26, 2015, the company and google entered into a services agreement that is effective as of april 1, 2016, following the expiration of the current services agreement, and expires on march 31, 2020. the company may choose to terminate the agreement effective march 31, 2019. these services agreements require that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by google. google may generally unilaterally update its own policies and guidelines without advance notice, which could in turn require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, revenue earned from google was $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, google revenue represents 83% and 94%; 83% and 97%; and 83% and 98%, of publishing and applications revenue, respectively.
the revenue earned by our video segment is derived from media production and distribution, subscriptions and advertising.
shoebuy's revenue is derived principally from merchandise sales. pricerunner's revenue is derived principally from advertising.
31
strategic partnerships, advertiser relationships and online advertising a significant component of the company's revenue is attributable to the services agreement with google described above. we market and offer our products and services directly to consumers through branded websites and subscriptions, allowing consumers to transact directly with us in a convenient manner. we have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in online and offline advertising to build our brands and drive traffic to our websites and consumers and advertisers to our businesses.
we pay traffic acquisition costs, which consist of payments to partners who distribute our partnerships customized browser-based applications, integrate our paid listings into their websites and fees related to the distribution and facilitation of in-app purchases of product features. we also pay to market and distribute our services on third-party distribution channels, such as search engines and social media websites. in addition, some of our businesses manage affiliate programs, pursuant to which we pay commissions and fees to third parties based on revenue earned. these distribution channels might also offer their own products and services, as well as those of other third parties, which compete with those we offer.
the cost of acquiring new consumers through online and offline third-party distribution channels has increased, particularly in the case of online channels, as internet commerce continues to grow and competition in the markets in which iac's businesses operate increases.
recent developments during the fourth quarter of 2015, iac realigned its reportable segments. see note 1-organization to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
on november 24, 2015, match group completed its ipo. at december 31, 2015, iac's ownership interest and voting interest in match group were 84.6% and 98.2%, respectively.

factors affecting consolidated results in 2015, we delivered 4% revenue growth; however, adjusted ebitda and operating income declined 11% and 53%, respectively. revenue growth was primarily driven by the match group, homeadvisor and video segments; the decline in adjusted ebitda was primarily driven by the publishing segment; and the decline in operating income was primarily driven by the publishing, match group, other and corporate segments. revenue growth at the match group was driven by an increase in direct revenue and the full year contribution from the princeton review. homeadvisor's revenue growth was driven by higher service requests and an increase in paying sps in their domestic business, while the video segment saw strong revenue growth at vimeo, dailyburn and electus. adjusted ebitda was negatively impacted by lower revenue at publishing driven by a decrease at ask.com and certain legacy businesses. the operating income decline was due to the decrease in adjusted ebitda, an $88.0 million impairment charge related to certain indefinite-lived intangible assets at publishing, an increase of $45.8 million in stock-based compensation ($29.2 million at match group and $15.8 million at corporate) and a $14.1 million goodwill impairment charge at other.

nm = not meaningful for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014
operating income in 2015 decreased from 2014 due to the decrease of $58.3 million in adjusted ebitda described above and increases of $82.0 million in amortization of intangibles, $45.8 million in stock-based compensation expense and $14.1 million in goodwill impairment, partially offset by an increase in gains of $2.1 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments. the increase in amortization of intangibles was due primarily to an $88.0 million impairment charge related to certain trade names of certain ask & other direct marketing brands, including ask.com. the impairment charge reflects the impact of recent google ecosystem changes that have impacted our ability to market, the effect of the reduced revenue share on mobile under the terms of the services agreement with google, which was entered into on october 26, 2015, and the shift in focus to higher margin businesses in publishing's premium brands. the combined impact of these factors has reduced the forecasted revenue and profits for these brands and the impairment charge reflects the resultant
39
reduction in fair value. the increase in stock-based compensation expense was due primarily to the modification of certain equity awards in the current year period, a higher number of forfeited awards in the prior year and issuance of equity awards since the prior year. the goodwill impairment charge at shoebuy was due to increased investment and the seasonal effect of high inventory levels as of october 1, 2015, the date of our most recent annual assessment. the increase in gains in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments was the result of an update of the future forecast of earnings and operating metrics related to certain acquired businesses.
at december 31, 2015, there was $190.6 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all equity-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.7 years.
for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013
operating income in 2014 decreased from 2013 due to the decrease of $54.2 million in adjusted ebitda described above and increases of $6.6 million in stock-based compensation expense and $2.2 million in depreciation, partially offset by an increase in gains of $13.7 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments and a decrease of $1.9 million in amortization of intangibles. the increase in stock-based compensation expense was due primarily to the issuance of equity awards since the prior year. the increase in gains of acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments was principally related to changes in twoo's future forecast of earnings and operating metrics. the decrease in amortization of intangibles was primarily related to lower amortization expense at dating due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized, and the inclusion in the prior year of a $3.4 million impairment charge associated with an indefinite-lived intangible asset related to the citygrid restructuring, partially offset by amortization of intangibles related to recent acquisitions.

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in 2015 increased from 2014 due primarily to reduced losses associated with our equity method investees, and the inclusion in the second quarter of 2014 of a $4.2 million other-than-temporary impairment charge on one of our investments following the sale of a majority of the investee's assets.
equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates in 2014 increased from 2013 due primarily to the inclusion in the second quarter of 2014 of the above mentioned $4.2 million other-than-temporary impairment charge, partially offset by reduced losses associated with our equity method investments.

interest expense in 2015 increased from 2014 due primarily to both the costs and the higher interest rate associated with the exchange of $445 million of match group senior notes for a substantially like amount of 2012 senior notes, as well as the $800 million match group term loan. in connection with the note exchange, $7.3 million in costs were expensed during the current year. the note exchange and term loan borrowings closed on november 16, 2015. interest expense in 2015 was also impacted by the accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs associated with the redemption of the liberty bonds on september 1, 2015.
interest expense in 2014 increased from 2013 due primarily to the 2013 senior notes, which were issued on november 15, 2013.

in 2015, the company recorded an income tax provision for continuing operations of $29.5 million, which represents an effective income tax rate of 21%. the effective rate was lower than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the realization of certain deferred tax assets, foreign income taxed at lower rates, the non-taxable gain on contingent consideration fair value adjustments in the current year period, and a reduction in tax reserves and related interest due to the expiration of statutes of limitations, partially offset by a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge and unbenefited losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries.
in 2014, the company recorded an income tax provision for continuing operations of $35.4 million, which represents an effective income tax rate of 13%. the effective rate was lower than the statutory rate of 35% due principally to a reduction in tax reserves and related interest of $88.2 million due to the expiration of statutes of limitations for federal income taxes for 2001 through 2009 and foreign income taxed at lower rates, partially offset by the largely unbenefited loss associated with the write-downs of certain of the company's investments and non-deductible goodwill associated with the sale of urbanspoon.
in 2013, the company recorded an income tax provision for continuing operations of $134.5 million, which represents an effective income tax rate of 32%. the effective rate was lower than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to foreign income taxed at lower rates.

(1) domestically, cash equivalents primarily consist of aaa rated money market funds and commercial paper rated a2/p2 or better.
(2) internationally, cash equivalents primarily consist of time deposits and aaa rated money market funds. if needed for our u.s. operations, most of the cash and cash equivalents held by the company's foreign subsidiaries could be repatriated; however, under current law, would be subject to u.s. federal and state income taxes. we have not provided for any such tax because the company currently does not anticipate a need to repatriate these funds to finance our u.s. operations and it is the company's intent to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the u.s.
(3) marketable securities consist of short-to-medium-term debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers and an equity security. the company invests in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity to fund current operations or satisfy other cash requirements as needed. the company also invests in equity securities as part of its investment strategy.

(5) the proceeds received from the match group term loan will be used for general corporate purposes.

assets related to the expiration of statutes of limitations for federal income taxes for the years 2001 through 2009. the changes from working capital activities consist of a decrease in income taxes payable of $94.5 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $19.9 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $30.1 million. the decrease in income taxes payable is primarily due to a net reduction in tax reserves related to the expiration of statutes of limitations for federal income taxes for the years 2001 through 2009, partially offset by current year income tax accruals in excess of current year income tax payments. the increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to revenue growth at homeadvisor. the increase in deferred revenue is due to increases related to acquisitions and growth in membership and subscription revenue at match group and vimeo, respectively.
net cash used in investing activities attributable to continuing operations in 2014 includes acquisitions of $259.4 million, which include the valueclick o&o website businesses, the princeton review, slimware and friendscout24, purchases of marketable debt securities, net of proceeds from maturities and sales of $154.2 million, capital expenditures of $57.2 million primarily related to the internal development of software to support our products and services, and investments of $24.3 million, partially offset by $58.4 million of proceeds from the sales of a business and long-term investments.

liquidity and capital resources the company's principal sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as cash flows generated from operations. iac has a $300 million revolving credit facility that was amended and restated on october 7, 2015, and now expires on october 7, 2020 (the "iac credit facility"). the obligations under the iac credit facility are secured by the stock of certain iac domestic and foreign subsidiaries and unconditionally guaranteed by certain wholly-owned iac domestic subsidiaries. at december 31, 2015, there were no outstanding borrowings under the iac credit facility. on october 7, 2015, match group entered into a credit agreement (the "match group credit agreement") which provides for a five-year $500 million revolving credit facility (the "match group credit facility"). at december 31, 2015, there were no outstanding borrowings under the match group credit facility.
44
on november 16, 2015, match group completed a private exchange offer to eligible holders to exchange any and all of the 2012 senior notes for up to $500 million aggregate principal amount of match group senior notes issued by match group ("match exchange offer"). match group exchanged $445.3 million of 2012 senior notes for $445.2 million of match group senior notes pursuant to the match exchange offer. promptly following the closing of the match exchange offer, substantially all of the restrictive covenants of the 2012 senior notes were removed and match group and its subsidiaries were designated as unrestricted subsidiaries of iac for purposes of the indentures governing the 2013 and 2012 senior notes and the iac credit facility. following the designation, neither match group nor any of its subsidiaries guaranteed any debt of iac, or are subject to any of the covenants related to such debt.
on november 16, 2015, match group amended and restated the match group credit agreement to provide for an $800 million, seven-year term loan. principal payments of $10 million under the match group term loan are due quarterly through maturity, at which point a final principal payment of $530 million will become due. additionally, the match group term loan may require additional annual principal payments as part of an excess cash flow sweep provision, the amount of which is governed by the net secured leverage ratio. the match group term loan bears interest, at its option, at either the base rate or libor, plus 3.50% or 4.50%, respectively, with, in the case of libor, a floor of 1.00%. interest payments are due no less than semi-annually through the term of the loan. the match group term loan and outstanding borrowings, if any, under the match group credit facility rank pari-passu with each other, and have priority over the match group senior notes.
the indenture governing the 2013 senior notes restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness in the event we are not in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0. in addition, the terms of the iac credit facility require that we maintain a leverage ratio of not more than 3.25 to 1.0 and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness. the indenture governing the match group senior notes restricts match group's ability to incur additional indebtedness in the event they are not in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio of 5.0 to 1.0. additionally, the terms of the match group credit facility require match group to maintain a leverage ratio of not more than 5.00 to 1.00 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.50 to 1.00. as of december 31, 2015, iac and match group were in compliance with all applicable covenants.
there are additional covenants under the match group credit facility and the match group term loan that limit match group's ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness, pay dividends or make distributions. while the match group term loan remains outstanding, these same covenants under the match group credit agreement are more restrictive than the covenants that are applicable to the match group credit facility. obligations under the match group credit facility and match group term loan are unconditionally guaranteed by certain wholly-owned match group domestic subsidiaries, and are also secured by the stock of certain match group domestic and foreign subsidiaries. in addition, match group is a separate and distinct legal entity with its own public shareholders and has no obligation to provide the company with funds. as a result, we may not freely access the cash of match group and its subsidiaries. match group generated approximately 60%, 41% and 43% of the company operating cash flow in the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
the company anticipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its operations. the company expects that 2016 capital expenditures will be higher than 2015 by approximately 10% to 20%, driven by leasehold improvements related to a new lease for match group's corporate headquarters and homeadvisor's sales center expansion. at december 31, 2015, iac had 5.6 million shares remaining in its share repurchase authorization. iac may purchase shares over an indefinite period of time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, depending on those factors iac management deems relevant at any particular time, including, without limitation, market conditions, share price and future outlook. on february 2, 2016, iac announced that it had suspended the quarterly cash dividend program. future declarations of dividends are subject to the determination of iac's board of directors.
the company believes its and match group's existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with their expected positive cash flows generated from operations and available borrowing capacity under their respective revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to fund their normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, debt service, and investing and other commitments for the foreseeable future. the company's and match group's liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our respective products and services. the company's indebtedness and match group's indebtedness could limit our respective abilities to: (i) obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs, acquisitions, capital expenditure or debt service or other requirements; and (ii) use operating cash flow to make acquisitions, capital expenditures, invest in other areas, such as developing properties and exploiting business opportunities. the company may make additional acquisitions and investments and, as a result, the company may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater financial flexibility. additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us.

iac's principles of financial reporting iac reports adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). this measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. we believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. this non-gaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results. iac endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-gaap measure presented by providing the comparable gaap measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-gaap measure. we encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the gaap and non-gaap measure, which we discuss below.
definition of iac's non-gaap measure adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("adjusted ebitda") is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements. we believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors. moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments. the above items are excluded from our adjusted ebitda measure because these items are non-cash in nature, and we believe that by excluding these items, adjusted ebitda corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. adjusted ebitda has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to iac's statement of operations of certain expenses.
non-cash expenses that are excluded from iac's non-gaap measure stock-based compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants, including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions, of stock options, restricted stock units ("rsus") and performance-based rsus. these expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method; however, performance-based rsus are included only to the extent the performance criteria have been met (assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period). upon the exercise of certain stock options and vesting of rsus and performance-based rsus, the awards are settled, at the company's discretion, on a net basis, with the company remitting the required tax-withholding amount from its current funds.
depreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives.
amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses related primarily to acquisitions. at the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as content, technology, customer lists, advertiser and supplier relationships, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives. value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization. an impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.
gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements are accounting adjustments to report contingent consideration liabilities at fair value. these adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered non-operational in nature and, therefore, are not indicative of current or future performance or ongoing costs of doing business.

critical accounting policies and estimates the following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of iac's accounting policies contained in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in regard to significant areas of judgment. management of the company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. these estimates, judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. actual results could differ from those estimates. because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others. what follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates.
business combinations the purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. the fair value of these intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. the excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill.
in connection with some business combinations, the company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price. each of these arrangements are recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and reflected at current fair value for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled. the contingent consideration arrangements are generally based upon earnings performance and/or operating metrics such as monthly active users. the company determines the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements by using probability-weighted analyses to determine the amounts of the gross liability, and, if the arrangement is long-term in nature, applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation to determine the net amount reflected in the consolidated financial statements. determining the fair value of these arrangements is inherently difficult and subjective. significant changes in forecasted earnings or operating metrics would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. the changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements each reporting period, including the accretion of the discount, if applicable, are recognized in "general and administrative expense" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. see note 7 for a discussion of contingent consideration arrangements.
recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the company's acquired trade names and trademarks, are assessed annually for impairment as of october 1 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. the annual assessments identified impairment charges in 2015 related to the publishing and shoebuy reporting units. these impairment charges are more fully described above in "results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013." the 2014 and 2013 annual assessments identified no material impairments. the value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that is subject to annual assessment for impairment is $2.2 billion and $380.1 million, respectively, at december 31, 2015.
the company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. for the company's annual goodwill test at october 1, 2015, a quantitative assessment of the match group, publishing, applications, shoebuy and pricerunner reporting units' goodwill was performed. a qualitative assessment of the homeadvisor, connected ventures, and dailyburn reporting units' goodwill was performed. when the company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, no further assessment of that reporting unit's goodwill is necessary; otherwise goodwill must be tested for impairment using a two-step process.
the first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the company's reporting units to its carrying value, including goodwill. in performing the first step, the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows ("dcf") and a market approach. determining fair value using a dcf analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items, including judgment about the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. the expected cash flows used in the dcf analyses are based on the company's most recent budget and, for years beyond the budget, the company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates. the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units. assumptions used in the dcf analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed annually based on the reporting units' current results and forecast, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. the discount rates used in the company's annual goodwill impairment assessment ranged from 12% to 22% in 2015 and 13% to 19% in 2014. determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based
49
on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies. from the comparable companies, a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. to determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units, we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use, monetization model, margin and growth characteristics and brand strength operating in their respective sectors.
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed. the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment, if any. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. in other words, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid. if the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
any impairment charge that might result in the future would be determined based upon the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value using the second step of the impairment analysis that is described above but, in any event, would not be expected to be lower than the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value. a primary driver in the dcf valuation analyses and the determination of the fair values of the company's reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability. generally, the company would expect an impairment if forecasted revenue and profitability are no longer expected to be achieved and as a result, the carrying value of a reporting unit(s) exceeds its fair value. this assessment would be based, in part, upon the performance of its businesses relative to budget, the company's assessment of macroeconomic factors, industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors.
at october 1, 2015, the date of our most recent annual impairment assessment, the fair value of the company's reporting units exceeded their carrying values by more than 20% with the exception of publishing and shoebuy. to illustrate the magnitude of a potential impairment charge relative to future changes in estimated fair value, had the estimated fair value of publishing and shoebuy been hypothetically lower by 10% and 20% as of october 1, 2015, the carrying value of publishing would have exceeded its fair value by approximately $20 million and $60 million, respectively, and the carrying value of shoebuy would have exceeded its fair value by approximately $1 million and $5 million, respectively.
while the company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, the company's policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as of october 1. the company determines the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined using an avoided royalty dcf valuation analysis. significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. the royalty rates used in the dcf analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the company's trade names and trademarks. assumptions used in the avoided royalty dcf analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. the discount rates used in the company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 11% to 16% in 2015 and 10% to 20% in 2014, and the royalty rates used ranged from 1% to 9% in both 2015 and 2014.
recoverability of long-lived assets we review the carrying value of all long-lived assets, comprising property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. if the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. during 2013 the company wrote off certain capitalized software costs. this charge is more fully described above in "results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 - depreciation." the carrying value of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets is $363.5 million at december 31, 2015.
income taxes we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. this measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which
50
may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. at december 31, 2015, the company has unrecognized tax benefits of $43.4 million, including interest. changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided may be material. differences between the reserves for income tax contingencies and the amounts owed by the company are recorded in the period they become known.
the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. as of december 31, 2015, the balance of deferred tax liabilities, net, is $346.8 million. actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities, as well as actual operating results of the company that vary significantly from anticipated results.
stock-based compensation as disclosed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the company estimated the fair value of stock options issued in 2015, 2014 and 2013 using a black-scholes option pricing model and, for those with a market condition, a lattice model. for stock options, including subsidiary denominated equity, the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date at fair value and expensed over the vesting term. the impact on stock-based compensation expense for the year ended december 31, 2015, assuming a 1% increase in the risk-free interest rate, a 10% increase in the volatility factor and a one year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding options would be an increase of $4.6 million, $21.2 million and $10.3 million, respectively. the impact on stock-based compensation expense for the year ended december 31, 2015, assuming a zero dividend yield on the outstanding options, would be an increase of $3.2 million. the company also issues rsus and performance-based rsus. for rsus issued, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of iac common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term. for performance-based rsus issued, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of iac common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved.
marketable securities and long-term investments at december 31, 2015, marketable securities consist of short-to-medium-term debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers and an equity security. long-term investments include equity securities accounted for under the equity and cost methods and marketable equity securities. the company invests in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity to fund current operations or satisfy other cash requirements as needed. the company also invests in marketable equity securities as part of its investment strategy.
marketable securities are adjusted to fair value each quarter, and the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders' equity. the specific-identification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold and the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings. the company recognizes unrealized losses on marketable securities in net earnings when the losses are determined to be other-than-temporary. additionally, the company evaluates each cost and equity method investment for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis, and recognizes an impairment loss if the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary. future events may result in reconsideration of the nature of losses as other-than-temporary and market and other factors may cause the value of the company's investments to decline.
the company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential other-than-temporary impairments of its investments. investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary. such impairment evaluations include, but are not limited to: the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the current business environment, including competition; going concern considerations such as financial condition, the rate at which the investee utilizes cash and the investee's ability to obtain additional financing to achieve its business plan; the need for changes to the investee's existing business model due to changing business and regulatory environments and its ability to successfully implement necessary changes; and comparable valuations. during 2015, 2014 and 2013, the company recognized other-than-temporary impairments of $6.7 million, $66.6 million and $5.0 million, respectively, related to cost method investments. these charges are more fully described above in "results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 - other income (expense), net."

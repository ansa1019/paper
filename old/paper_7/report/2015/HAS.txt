2015 versus 2014
net revenue growth in the boys, games and preschool categories in 2015 compared to 2014 more than offset lower net revenues from the girls category.
boys the boys category grew 20% in 2015 compared to 2014. higher net revenues from franchise brand nerf and partner brands jurassic world, marvel and star wars were slightly offset by lower net revenues from franchise brand transformers.
within the boys category, there are a number of entertainment-based brands which, from year to year, may be supported by major theatrical releases. as such, boys category net revenues by brand fluctuate from year-to-year depending on movie popularity, release dates and related product line offerings and success. in 2015, three partner brands were supported by major theatrical releases  jurassic world was supported by the june
32
2015 release of jurassic world, marvel was supported by the may 2015 release of avengers: age of ultron and star wars was supported by the december 2015 release of star wars: the force awakens. these benefits were partially offset by lower 2015 net revenues from franchise brand transformers in a non-movie year as compared to 2014 with the june theatrical release of transformers: age of extinction.
games the games category grew 1% in 2015 compared to 2014. higher net revenues resulted from franchise brands magic: the gathering and monopoly as well as from other games brands, including, but not limited to, pie face, duel masters, dungeons & dragons, life, ouija, risk, rubiks, trouble and yahtzee. these higher net revenues were almost wholly offset by lower net revenues from various other games brands, including, but not limited to, elefun & friends, jenga and taboo.
girls the girls category declined 22% in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to expected lower net revenues from furby products, as well as declines in my little pony, nerf rebelle and littlest pet shop. core my little pony revenues increased but were, however, more than offset by lower net revenues from the my little pony equestria girls products. these declines were only partially offset by the first full year of net revenues from the play-doh doh vinci brand, the 2015 introduction of the disneys descendants product line and initial shipments of disney princess and frozen products which became available at retail in january 2016.
preschool the preschool category grew 17% in 2015 compared to 2014. higher net revenues from franchise brand play-doh and partner brands jurassic world and star wars were only partially offset by lower revenues from the companys core playskool product line. consistent with the boys category, preschool category net revenues from partner brands benefited from the strong theatrical line-up discussed above.
2014 versus 2013
net revenue growth in the boys and girls categories in 2014 compared to 2013 more than offset lower net revenues from the games and preschool categories.
boys the boys category grew 20% in 2014 compared to 2013. higher net revenues from franchise brands transformers and nerf and partner brand marvel were partially offset by expected lower net sales of beyblade products. to a lesser extent, net sales from star wars products also contributed to boys category growth in 2014.
2014 boys category growth reflects successful execution of hasbros franchise brand-focused strategy in conjunction with its brand blueprint. net revenues from franchise brand transformers products benefited from higher net revenues, including higher product sales and royalty income, related to products based on the 2014 major motion picture release of transformers: age of extinction, as well as animated television programming in 2014 and 2013.
sales of marvel products, primarily spider-man and avengers products, increased in 2014 compared to 2013. spider-man was supported by the 2014 major motion picture release of the amazing spider-man 2. 2014 net revenues also included sales related to the 2014 theatrical releases of captain america: the winter solidier and guardians of the galaxy.
games the games category declined 4% in 2014 compared to 2013. growth from franchise brands magic: the gathering and monopoly as well as other games brands, including simon, specifically simon swipe, the game of life, trouble and dungeons & dragons were more than offset by lower net revenues from other games brands, primarily duel masters, angry birds and twister.
girls the girls category grew 2% in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily related to higher net revenues from franchise brands, my little pony and nerf rebelle, partially offset by lower net revenues from franchise brand littlest pet shop and challenger brands furby and furreal friends.
33
net revenues from my little pony products experienced continued momentum with support from the successful television program, my little pony: friendship is magic, as well as the third quarter 2013 introduction of my little pony equestria girls fashion doll products which were supported by animated movie releases in both 2013 and 2014. nerf rebelle, a line of action performance products, introduced during the second half of 2013 also contributed to growth in 2014. 2014 net revenues also included the second quarter 2014 introduction of doh vinci, a line of arts and crafts products which leveraged the franchise brand play-doh.
net revenues from furby declined in 2014 compared to 2013, which was expected based on the level of net revenues achieved in 2013, which was the first full year of net revenues from furby products, including the introduction of furby in non-english speaking markets. revenues from furby, a fashion-oriented brand, are generally higher in the first full year of introduction.
preschool the preschool category declined 4% in 2014 compared to 2013. higher net revenues from franchise brands, play-doh and transformers, specifically playskool heroes transformers rescue bots were more than offset by lower net revenues from sesame street, core playskool and tonka products. transformers product lines benefited from both the 2014 major motion picture release of transformers: age of extinction, as well as animated television programming in 2014.

u.s. and canada
2015 versus 2014
u.s. and canada segment operating profit increased 29% in 2015 compared to 2014. higher operating profit reflects higher net revenues discussed above as well as product mix and lower intangible amortization, partially offset by higher overheads and shipping and warehousing costs. operating profit margin improved to 19.4% of net revenues in 2015 from 16.5% of net revenues in 2014. improved operating profit margin reflects both revenue volume and product mix, including lower advertising as a percentage of net revenues. foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on u.s. and canada operating profit in 2015.
2014 versus 2013
u.s. and canada operating profit increased 7% in 2014 compared to 2013 and operating profit margin improved to 16.5% in 2014 from 15.6% in 2013. the improvement in operating profit and operating profit margin was the result of higher net revenues and improved product mix, as well as lower shipping and distribution costs. foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on u.s. and canada operating profit in 2014.
international
2015 versus 2014
international segment operating profit decreased 6% in 2015 compared to 2014 and included an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of $46.7 million. absent the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation, international segment operating profit grew 12%. the decline in operating profit, as reported, is primarily due to lower net revenues, partially offset by lower advertising, shipping and warehousing, and intangible amortization. operating profit margin decreased to 13.0% in 2015 from 13.4% in 2014. the decrease in segment operating profit margin reflects lower net revenues and higher overhead costs, partially offset by lower advertising and shipping and warehousing costs.
37
2014 versus 2013
international segment operating profit increased 15% in 2014 compared to 2013. operating profit for the international segment in 2014 was impacted by approximately $18.8 million due to unfavorable foreign currency translation. furthermore, 2014 segment operating profit includes $6.1 million of restructuring charges. operating profit margin increased to 13.4% of segment net revenues in 2014 from 12.6% of segment net revenues in 2013. the increase in operating profit in 2014 was the result of higher net revenues and favorable product mix, partially offset by higher expense levels. the improvement in operating profit margin in 2014 is primarily due to both revenue volume and mix, along with better expense leverage from higher net revenues.
entertainment and licensing
2015 versus 2014
entertainment and licensing segment operating profit increased 27% in 2015 compared to 2014 and operating profit margin increased to 31.4% of net revenues in 2015 compared to 27.6% in 2014. higher entertainment revenues related to a multi-year digital distribution agreement contributed to improved operating profit. operating profit and operating profit margin also improved on lower amortization of intangibles and program production cost amortization. lower amortization of intangibles reflects certain digital gaming rights which became fully amortized during the second quarter of 2015 whereas lower program product cost amortization reflects a higher level of programming write downs occurring in the second half of 2014 compared to 2015. these increases were partially offset by higher selling, distribution and administration expenses reflecting investment in expanding the global footprint of the companys consumer products licensing teams.
2014 versus 2013
entertainment and licensing segment operating profit increased 33% in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase in operating profit is primarily due to the profit impact from higher net revenues from consumer products licensing, partially offset by the profit impact from lower entertainment revenues. backflip operating losses approximated $8.7 million in 2014 and were primarily due to amortization of acquired intangibles.
other segments and corporate and eliminations in the global operations segment, operating profit of $12.0 million in 2015 compared to $15.8 million in 2014 and $6.7 million in 2013.
in corporate and eliminations, operating loss of $83.0 million in 2015 compared to operating losses of $46.1 million in 2014 and $134.3 million in 2013. the 2013 operating loss includes the following charges, $46.1 million  settlement of an adverse arbitration award and $40.6 million  other product-related charges. 2013 also includes certain charges related to the write-off of early film development costs associated with films that had not yet been moved to production.

operating expenses for 2015, 2014 and 2013 include benefits and expenses related to the following events:
   in august 2015, the company finalized the sale of its manufacturing operations in east longmeadow, ma and waterford, ireland. this transaction resulted in a benefit to selling, distribution and administration expenses of $3.1 million.

                                                         in september 2014, the company and discovery amended their relationship with respect to discovery family channel (the network). prior to the amendment, the company had a license agreement with the network that required payment of royalties by the company to the network based on a percentage of revenue derived from products related to television shows broadcast on the network. this agreement included a minimum royalty guarantee of $125.0 million, which has been paid in full. as part of the amended relationship, this earn-out period was extended to 2021 resulting in a benefit of $2.3 million to royalties for the year ended december 28, 2014. furthermore, this amended relationship resulted in an amendment to the companys tax sharing agreement with discovery which resulted in a net expense of $0.9 million recorded to selling, distribution and administration expense for the year ended december 28, 2014.

                                                 in february 2014, the company settled outstanding disputes with an inventor related to the contractual interpretation of which products were subject to payment of royalties under two license agreements between the inventor and the company relating to the companys nerf and super soaker product lines. as a result, the company recorded a total charge of $61.1 million, of which $43.0 million and
$3.1 million were recorded to royalties and selling, distribution and administration expense, respectively, for the year ended december 29, 2013. a portion of this total charge was also recorded to interest expense which is discussed below.

                                                      during the fourth quarter of 2012, the company announced a multi-year cost savings initiative. this initiative included an approximate 10% workforce reduction, facility consolidations and process improvements. the company recognized charges totaling $5.2 million and $36.7 million for the years ended december 28, 2014 and december 29, 2013, respectively, primarily related to employee severance charges, which impacted cost of sales, product development and selling, distribution and administration expenses. furthermore, the company also recognized pension curtailment and settlement charges in the amount of $7.0 million in selling, distribution and administration expense during the year ended december 29, 2013.

                                     during the fourth quarter of 2013, the company decided to exit certain brands which were non-core to its franchise brand strategy. certain of these brands related to prior acquisitions and had intangible assets, resulting in a write-off of these intangibles of $19.7 million, which were recorded to amortization of intangibles for the year ended december 29, 2013.

   during the fourth quarter of 2013 the company amended its license agreement with zynga which resulted in additional royalty expense of $20.9 million.

in total, these (benefits) expenses were recorded to the consolidated statements of operations as follows:

cost of sales cost of sales primarily consists of purchased materials, labor, manufacturing overheads and other inventory-related costs such as obsolescence. cost of sales decreased 1% to $1,677.0 million, or 37.7% of net revenues, for
39
the year ended december 27, 2015 compared to $1,698.4 million, or 39.7% of net revenues, for the year ended december 28, 2014 despite consolidated net revenue growth of 4%. lower cost of sales in dollars and as a percent of net revenues reflects both product and revenue mix. product mix reflects higher net revenues from royalty-bearing products which generally carry higher pricing and, therefore, have a lower cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues. generally, the lower cost of sales on royalty-bearing products may be partially offset by higher royalty expense. in 2015, the following entertainment-driven, royalty-bearing brands were supported by major theatrical releases: jurassic world, marvel and star wars. likewise, revenue mix reflects higher net revenue contributions from the companys entertainment and licensing segment. in 2015, entertainment and licensing segment net revenues were 5.5% of consolidated net revenues compared to 5.1% in 2014.
in 2014, cost of sales increased in dollars from $1,672.9 million for 2013 to $1,698.4 million in 2014, but decreased as a percent of net revenues from 41.0% in 2013 to 39.7% in 2014. absent the impact of aforementioned charges, cost of sales was $1,662.7 million, or 40.7% of net revenues, for the year ended december 29, 2013. the cost of sales increase in dollars in 2014 compared to 2013 reflects higher net revenues. the cost of sales decrease as a percent of net revenues in 2014 compared to 2013 reflects a more favorable revenue mix and impact from cost savings and efficiencies from the companys owned-manufacturing facilities partially offset by the impact on net revenues of higher sales promotions. in 2014, product mix reflects higher net revenues from royalty-bearing products which generally carry higher pricing and, therefore, have a lower cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues, as well as higher net revenues from the high margin entertainment and licensing segment.
royalty expense royalty expense of $379.2 million, or 8.5% or net revenues, in 2015 compared to $305.3 million, or 7.1% of net revenues, in 2014 and $338.9 million, or 8.3% of net revenues, in 2013. excluding the impact of the arbitration award settlement and amendment of the zynga agreement summarized above, 2013 royalty expense was $275.1 million, or 6.7% of net revenues. fluctuations in royalty expense generally relate to the volume of entertainment-driven products sold in a given period, especially if there is a major motion picture release. product lines related to hasbro-owned or controlled brands supported by entertainment generally do not incur the same level of royalty expense as licensed properties, particularly star wars and marvel. higher royalty expense, in both dollars and as a percentage of net revenues, in 2015 compared to 2014 and 2013 reflect the mix of entertainment-driven product sold. in particular, higher royalty expense in 2015 compared to 2014 reflects higher net sales of marvel, jurassic world and star wars products partially offset by lower net sales of transformers royalty-bearing movie product in 2015 compared to 2014. higher royalty expense, in both dollars and as a percent of net revenues, in 2014 compared to 2013 reflects the strength of the 2014 entertainment line-up compared to 2013, including higher sales of transformers movie products.
product development product development expense in 2015 totaled $242.9 million, or 5.5% of net revenues, compared to $222.6 million, or 5.2% of net revenues, in 2014. the increase in product development expense primarily reflects development costs incurred related to the disney princess and frozen license agreement. these higher expenses were not offset by related revenues as initial product shipments did not commence until late in the fourth quarter of 2015 in preparation for the january 1, 2016 retail on-shelf date. additionally, the company continues to incur product development expenses related to the development of a new digital platform for magic: the gathering and the development of new mobile game offerings by backflip.
product development expense in 2014 totaled $222.6 million, or 5.2% of net revenues, compared to $207.6 million, or 5.1% of net revenues, in 2013. product development expense for 2013 included restructuring charges of $4.1 million. excluding the impact of these charges, product development expense was $203.5 million in 2013. the increases in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily reflects the addition of backflip, as well as continued investment in certain brands, particularly magic: the gathering. furthermore, during the fourth quarter of 2014, the company began to incur development costs related to the disney princess and frozen license agreement with disney.
40
advertising expense advertising expense in 2015 totaled $409.4 million compared to $420.3 million in 2014 and $398.1 million in 2013. the level of the companys advertising expense can generally be impacted by revenue mix, the amount and type of theatrical releases, and television programming. advertising as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 9.2% in 2015 from 9.8% in 2014. the year-over-year decrease in advertising expense reflects the mix of revenues, primarily the higher level of partner brand net revenues, as well as the increase in entertainment and licensing segment net revenues. entertainment-backed product lines generally require less in advertising by the company. advertising expense was consistent as a percentage of net revenues in 2014 and 2013 at 9.8% of net revenues. the increase in dollars in advertising expense in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher net revenues.
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles totaled $43.7 million, or 1.0% of net revenues, in 2015 compared to $52.7 million, or 1.2% of net revenues, in 2014 and $78.2 million, or 1.9% of net revenues in 2013. lower amortization of intangibles in 2015 compared to 2014 reflects the impact of intangible assets which were fully amortized during 2014 and 2015. amortization of intangibles in 2013 includes $19.7 million related to impairment of definite-lived intangibles based on the companys decision to exit the related product lines. absent the impact of these charges, amortization of intangibles was $58.5 million, or 1.4% of net revenues, in 2013. lower amortization of intangibles in 2014 compared to 2013 reflects the impact of intangible assets which were fully amortized during 2013.
program product cost amortization program production cost amortization totaled $42.4 million, or 1.0% of net revenues, compared to $47.1 million, or 1.1% of net revenues, in 2014 and $47.7 million, or 1.2% of net revenues, in 2013. program production costs are capitalized as incurred and amortized using the individual-film-forecast method. program production cost amortization reflects the level of revenues associated with television programming as well as the type of television programs produced and distributed. the decrease in program production cost amortization in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a lower amount of accelerated amortization.
selling, distribution and administration expenses selling, distribution and administration expenses were $960.8 million, or 21.6% of net revenues, in 2015 compared to $895.5 million, or 20.9% of net revenues, in 2014. selling, distribution and administration expense for 2015 includes a benefit of $3.1 million related to the august 2015 sale of the companys manufacturing operations while 2014 includes a charge of $6.1 million related to restructuring activities, including the companys equity investment in the joint venture television network. absent these charges, selling, distribution and administration expenses increased to $963.9 million, or 21.7% of net revenues, in 2015 from $889.4 million, or 20.8% of net revenues in 2014. foreign exchange resulted in a decrease of $66.7 million in 2015 compared to 2014. excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the impact of the benefits and charges discussed above, selling, distribution and administration costs increased primarily due to higher administration, marketing and sales and distribution costs. higher 2015 administration and sales and marketing expenses are primarily the result of higher performance-based stock compensation, investments in the magic: the gathering brand, depreciation expense and other general cost increases, such as salaries and wages. higher distribution costs reflect increased net revenues in 2015, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
selling, distribution and administration expenses increased to $895.5 million, or 20.9% of net revenues, in 2014 from $871.7 million, or 21.3% of net revenues, in 2013. selling, distribution and administration expense in 2013 includes $32.5 million of charges related to restructuring activities, and legal costs associated with the arbitration settlement. excluding these charges as well as the 2014 charges discussed above, selling, distribution and administration expense increased to $889.4 million, or 20.8% of net revenues, in 2014 from $839.2 million, or 20.6% of net revenues, in 2013. higher selling, distribution and administration expenses in 2014 compared to
41
2013 reflects continued investment in emerging markets and certain brands, primarily magic: the gathering, a full year of expense related to backflip, higher performance-based stock compensation and increased depreciation expense associated with investments in information systems.
non-operating (income) expense interest expense interest expense totaled $97.1 million in 2015 compared to $93.1 million in 2014 and $105.6 million in 2013. the increase in interest expense in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily reflects the impact of costs related to forward-starting interest rate swap contracts on the 2014 debt issuance compared to a benefit on interest rate hedges which expired in 2014. interest expense in 2013 included approximately $15.1 million related to the settlement of an arbitration award. absent these charges, interest expense totaled $90.5 million in 2013. the increase in interest expense in 2014 compared to the 2013 adjusted total primarily reflects the higher benefit of interest rate swap agreements in effect in 2013, partially offset by the benefit of lower interest rates on long-term debt.
interest income interest income was $3.1 million in 2015 compared to $3.8 million in 2014 and $4.9 million in 2013. lower interest income in 2015 compared to 2014 reflects lower average interest rates which were only partially offset by higher average cash balances. decreased interest income in 2014 compared to 2013 reflects lower average cash balances. average interest rates for 2014 and 2013 were consistent.
other (income) expense, net other income, net of $6.0 million in 2015 compared to other expense, net of $6.0 million in 2014 and $14.6 million in 2013. the following table outlines major contributors to other (income) expense, net.

$(6.0   )              6.0              14.6
   foreign currency losses decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher losses in the fourth quarter of 2014 due to the rapid strengthening of the u.s. dollar. this was also the reason 2014 losses were higher than those in 2013.

   (earnings) losses from joint ventures are comprised of the companys share in the results of the network.

           in september 2014, the company and discovery amended their relationship with respect to the network. the 2014 loss consists of the companys share of restructuring costs recorded by the network, partially offset by a gain resulting from the reduction of amounts due to discovery under a tax sharing agreement.

   in august 2015, the company finalized the sale of its manufacturing operations in east longmeadow, ma and waterford, ireland which resulted in the recognition of a gain of $6.6 million in other (income) expense, net.

                                  the 2014 gain on the sale of certain assets reflects gains of $36.0 million related to the sale of certain intellectual property license rights and
$3.4 million related to the sale of an internet domain name. the 2015 gain includes additional proceeds related to the sale of those intellectual property license rights sold during the fourth quarter of 2014.

income taxes income tax expense totaled 26.0% of pretax earnings in 2015 compared with 23.5% in 2014 and 19.3% in 2013. income tax expense for 2015 includes net benefits of approximately $4.0 million from discrete events, primarily related to the statute of limitations expirations of various international jurisdictions. income tax expense for 2014 includes net benefits of approximately $20.0 million from discrete tax events, primarily related to the effective settlement of certain open tax years in the united states and settlement of tax examinations in certain jurisdictions, including mexico. income tax expense for 2013 includes net benefits of approximately $30.0 million from discrete tax events, primarily related to the settlement of various tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions, including the united states. absent these items, potential interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions recorded in 2015, 2014 and 2013, and the impact of the 2013 charges related to restructuring activities, exit from certain product lines and settlement of an unfavorable arbitration award, the effective tax rates would have been 26.4%, 26.5% and 25.8%, respectively. the increase in the adjusted tax rate from 2013 to 2014 and decrease from 2014 to 2015 primarily reflect the change in the geographic mix of where the company earned its profits.
other information in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb), issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (asc 606). this asu supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in accounting standards codification 605  revenue recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the codification. this new guidance provides a five-step model for analyzing contracts and transactions to determine when, how and if revenue is recognized. revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. this asu is now effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2017, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, and may be adopted early but not before december 15, 2016. the company is evaluating the requirements of asu 2014-09 and its potential impact on the companys financial statements and does not presently believe the adoption of this new standard will have a material impact on the companys results or financial statements.
in april 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-03, interest  imputation of interest (asc 835-30), which simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs. asu 2015-03 requires debt issuance costs related to long-term debt to be presented in the balance sheet as a reduction to the carrying amount of the related debt liability, consistent with the presentation of discounts. asu 2015-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2015, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, and is eligible for early adoption. the company elected early adoption and deferred debt costs are presented as a reduction of long-term debt. those balances presented for comparable periods have been reclassified to reflect this change in accounting principle.
in may 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-07, fair value measurement  disclosure for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent), which simplifies the presentation of the fair value hierarchy by removing the requirement to include those investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. asu 2015-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2015, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. early adoption is permitted. the company does not believe that the change in disclosure requirement will have a material impact on the companys results or financial statements.
in november 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-17, income taxes (asc 740), which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes. asu 2015-17 removes the requirement to bifurcate deferred income tax assets and liabilities between current and non-current. under asu 2015-17, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required to be classified as non-current. asu 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2016 and is eligible for early adoption. the company elected early adoption and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are presented as non-current in the consolidated balance sheets. those balances presented for comparable periods have been reclassified to reflect this change in accounting principle.

liquidity and capital resources the company has historically generated a significant amount of cash from operations. in 2015 the company funded its operations and liquidity needs primarily through cash flows from operations, and, when needed, using borrowings under its available lines of credit and its commercial paper program. during 2016, the company expects to continue to fund its working capital needs primarily through cash flows from operations and, when needed, by issuing commercial paper or borrowing under its revolving credit agreement. in the event that the company is not able to issue commercial paper, the company intends to utilize its available lines of credit. the company believes that the funds available to it, including cash expected to be generated from operations and funds available through its commercial paper program or its available lines of credit are adequate to meet its working capital needs for 2016, however, unexpected events or circumstances such as material operating losses or increased capital or other expenditures, or inability to otherwise access the commercial paper market, may reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources. in addition, significant disruptions to credit markets may also reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources. although the company believes the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to its financial facilities is not significant, in times of severe economic downturn in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to the company.
in may 2014, the company issued $600.0 million in long-term debt consisting of $300.0 million in 3.15% notes due 2021 and $300.0 million in 5.10% notes due 2044 (collectively, the notes). the company may redeem the notes at its option at the greater of the principal amount of the notes or the present value of the remaining scheduled payments using the effective interest rate on applicable u.s. treasury bills at the time of repurchase. the proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used, primarily, to repay $425.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 6.125% notes due 2014 upon maturity, including accrued and unpaid interest. the remaining net proceeds were utilized for general corporate and working capital purposes.
as of december 27, 2015, the companys cash and cash equivalents totaled $976.8 million, substantially all of which is held by international subsidiaries. deferred income taxes have not been provided on the majority of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as such earnings are indefinitely reinvested by the company. accordingly, such international cash balances are not available to fund cash requirements in the united states unless the company changes its reinvestment policy. the company has sufficient sources of cash in the united states to fund cash requirements without the need to repatriate any funds. if the company changes its policy of permanently reinvesting international earnings, it would be required to accrue for any additional income taxes representing the difference between the tax rates in the united states and the applicable tax rates of the international subsidiaries. if the company repatriated the funds from its international subsidiaries, it would then be required to pay the additional u.s. income tax. the majority of the companys cash and cash equivalents held outside of the united states as of december 27, 2015 is denominated in the u.s. dollar.
in 2015, 2014 and 2013, hasbro generated $552.4 million, $454.4 million and $401.1 million of cash from its operating activities, respectively. operating cash flows in 2015, 2014 and 2013 included $42.5 million, $31.4 million and $41.3 million, respectively, of cash used for television program and film production. cash from operations in 2013 includes a final long-term royalty advance payment of $25.0 million made to discovery family channel.

accounts receivable, net increased 11% in 2015 compared to 2014. excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, accounts receivable, net, increased 23% reflecting revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2015, excluding unfavorable foreign currency translation, of 23% compared to 2014. days sales outstanding decreased to 75 days at december 27, 2015 from 76 days at december 28, 2014. accounts receivable, net was flat in 2014 compared to 2013. excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, accounts receivable, net increased 10% in 2014 compared to 2013, reflecting 7% revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2014, excluding unfavorable foreign currency translation, compared to 2013. days sales outstanding decreased to 76 days at december 28, 2014 from 77 days at december 29, 2013.
inventories increased 13% at the end of 2015 compared to 2014. excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, inventories increased 24% in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase in inventories, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, is primarily due to higher levels in the united states and europe in support of 2016 initiatives and growth in the business. inventories declined by 3% in 2014 compared to 2013, however, grew 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. inventory in the international segment increased approximately 32% absent foreign currency translation reflecting growth in the international segment, including emerging markets. higher inventories in the international segment were partially offset by lower inventories in the u.s. and canada segment, which declined 23%.
prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased 9% in 2015 compared to 2014. higher balances related to favorable foreign currency hedge contracts and amounts due from cartamundi related to the sale of the companys manufacturing operations were more than offset by lower royalty advances and non-income based tax receivables, primarily valued added taxes in europe. prepaid expenses and other current assets increased approximately 18% in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to higher favorable balances related to foreign currency hedging contracts and increased prepaid income taxes. these increases were only partially offset by lower prepaid royalties, primarily related to marvel.
goodwill and other intangible assets, net decreased to $873.5 million at december 27, 2015 from $918.0 million at december 28, 2014 and $970.3 million at december 29, 2013. the decrease in each period was due to amortization of intangible assets.
other assets increased 3% in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase primarily reflects long-term amounts due from cartamundi related to the sale of the companys manufacturing operations as well as higher long-term receivables related to multi-year television distribution agreements. these increases were partially offset by lower long-term royalty advances. other assets decreased approximately 9% in 2014 compared to 2013. this decrease primarily relates to the partial sale of the companys investment in the network and, to a lesser extent, lower long-term prepaid royalties which have been reclassified from non-current to current or have been earned. these decreases were partially offset by higher favorable balances related to foreign currency hedging contracts.
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased 10% in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher accrued royalties for licensed properties reflecting 2015s stronger entertainment line-up compared to 2014 as well as higher accrued performance-based compensation reflecting the companys overall performance. these
45
increases were partially offset by lower accrued advertising. accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased approximately 12% in 2014 compared to 2013. the decrease was primarily due to lower accrued royalties and accrued interest, primarily resulting from the payment of amounts accrued at the end of 2013 related to the settlement of an adverse arbitration award as well as lower accrued severance due to scheduled payments.
other liabilities increased 3% in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase primarily reflects higher uncertain tax positions partially offset by a reduction in pension liabilities reflecting changes in actuarial assumptions, primarily due to higher discount rates. other liabilities increased 12% in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase reflects higher pension liabilities primarily due to changes in actuarial assumptions, including lower discount rates and updated mortality tables. in addition, the amended relationship between the company and discovery resulted in a net increase to other liabilities of approximately $10.7 million reflecting the fair value of an option agreement related to the companys equity interest in the network, partially offset by a reduction in the amounts due to discovery related to a tax sharing agreement. these increases were partially offset by lower liabilities related to uncertain tax positions reflecting the settlement of tax examinations in 2014 primarily related to the united states and mexico. in connection with the settlement of tax assessments and years subject to audit from 2000 through 2013 in mexico, the company paid approximately $65.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2014.
cash flows utilized by investing activities were $103.6 million, $0.5 million and $217.7 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. additions to property, plant and equipment increased in 2015 to $142.0 million from $113.4 million and $112.0 in 2014 and 2013, respectively. of these additions, 54% in 2015, 60% in 2014 and 51% in 2013 were for purchases of tools, dies and molds related to the companys products. absent the companys investment in tools, dies and molds, higher capital expenditures reflect the companys investment in information systems. in 2016, the company expects capital expenditures to be in the range of $130.0 million to $160.0 million. during the three years ended december 27, 2015, the depreciation of plant and equipment was $111.6 million, $105.3 million and $102.8 million, respectively. fluctuations in depreciation of plant and equipment correlate with the percentage of additions to property, plant and equipment relating to tools, dies and molds which have shorter useful lives and accelerated depreciation. excluding capital expenditures, 2015 proceeds from investing activities reflects $18.6 million related to the sale of the companys manufacturing operations and $20.7 million in capital and tax distributions from discovery family channel. the 2014 utilization is almost wholly offset by $64.4 million of cash received from discovery from the partial sale of the companys equity interest in the network and $36.0 million of cash received from the sale of certain intellectual property licensing rights which was included in other investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. the higher utilization in 2013 reflects the companys acquisition of a majority stake in backflip for $110.0 million, net of cash acquired, as well as a payment related to an existing intellectual property.
the company commits to inventory production, advertising and marketing expenditures prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season. accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in their holiday selling season. due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period, payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year. this timing difference between expenditures and cash collections on accounts receivable makes it necessary for the company to borrow higher amounts during the latter part of the year. during 2015, 2014 and 2013, the company primarily used cash from operations and borrowings under its commercial paper program and available lines of credit.
the company has an agreement with a group of banks which provides for a commercial paper program (the program). under the program, at the request of the company and subject to market conditions, the banks may either purchase from the company, or arrange for the sale by the company, of unsecured commercial paper notes. the company may issue notes from time to time up to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any given time of $700.0 million. the maturities of the notes may vary but may not exceed 397 days. the notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are issued at a discount to par, or alternatively, sold at par and bear varying interest rates based on a fixed or floating rate basis. the interest rates vary based on market conditions and the ratings assigned to the notes by the credit rating agencies at the time of issuance. borrowings under the program are supported by the companys $700.0 million revolving credit agreement. at december 27, 2015, the company had $160.0 million in borrowings outstanding related to the program.
46
the company has a revolving credit agreement (the agreement) which provides the company with a $700.0 million committed borrowing facility. the agreement contains certain financial covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility, including with respect to liens, mergers and incurrence of indebtedness. the company was in compliance with all covenants in the agreement as of and for the fiscal year ended december 27, 2015. the company had no borrowings outstanding under its committed revolving credit facility at december 27, 2015. however, letters of credit outstanding under this facility as of december 27, 2015 were approximately $0.8 million. amounts available and unused under the committed line at december 27, 2015 were approximately $539.2 million, inclusive of borrowings under the companys commercial paper program. the company also has other uncommitted lines from various banks, of which approximately $28.3 million was utilized at december 27, 2015. of the amount utilized under, or supported by, the uncommitted lines, approximately $4.6 million and $23.7 million represent outstanding short-term borrowings and letters of credit, respectively.
net cash utilized by financing activities was $346.5 million, $231.0 million and $341.0 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the 2014 utilization includes net proceeds from the issuance and repayment of long-term debt totaling $135.0 million. in 2014, the company issued an aggregate $600.0 million in long-term notes which were partially utilized to re-pay the $425.0 million in long-term notes due in may 2014. of the amounts utilized in 2015, 2014 and 2013, $87.2 million, $459.6 million and $103.5 million, respectively, reflects cash paid, including transaction costs, to repurchase the companys common stock, respectively. during 2015, 2014 and 2013, the company repurchased 1.2 million, 8.5 million and 2.3 million shares, respectively, at an average price of $68.01, $54.26 and $45.17. at december 27, 2015, $479.3 million remained under outstanding board authorizations. dividends paid were $225.8 million in 2015 compared to $216.9 million in 2014 and $156.1 million in 2013. dividends paid in 2013 includes only three quarterly payments resulting from a decision by the companys board to accelerate the payment of the dividend declared in december 2012, which historically would have been paid in february 2013, to december 2012. this acceleration resulted in one less quarterly dividend paid in 2013. further, the company has increased its quarterly dividend rate from $0.40 in 2013 to $0.43 in 2014 and $0.46 in 2015. proceeds from short-term borrowings of $246.1 million in 2014 compared to repayments of short-term borrowings of $87.3 million in 2015 and $215.3 million in 2013. the company generated cash from employee stock option transactions of $57.6 million, $71.4 million and $140.4 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
for the $350.0 million in notes due in 2017 which bear interest at 6.30%, interest rates may be adjusted upward in the event that the companys credit rating from moodys investor services, inc., standard & poors ratings services or fitch ratings is reduced to ba1, bb+, or bb+, respectively, or below. at december 27, 2015, the companys ratings from moodys investor services, inc., standard & poors ratings services and fitch ratings were baa2, bbb and bbb+, respectively. the interest rate adjustment is dependent on the degree of decrease of the companys ratings and could range from 0.25% to a maximum of 2.00%. the company may redeem the notes at its option at the greater of the principal amount of the notes or the present value of the remaining scheduled payments discounted using the effective interest rate on applicable u.s. treasury bills at the time of repurchase.
including the notes described above, the company has principal amounts of long-term debt at december 27, 2015 of approximately $1,559.9 million due at varying times from 2017 through 2044. the company also had letters of credit and other similar instruments of $27.9 million and 2016 purchase commitments of $518.5 million outstanding at december 27, 2015. in addition, the company expects to be committed to guaranteed royalty payments of approximately $83.6 million in 2016, including $40.0 million contingent on theatrical movie releases.
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. as such, management is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
47
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the companys reported financial results include sales allowances, program production costs, recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, recoverability of royalty advances and commitments, pension costs and obligations and income taxes.
sales allowances sales allowances for customer promotions, discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized. revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer, generally at the time of shipment. revenue from product sales, less related sales allowances along with license fees and royalty revenue comprise net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. the company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers. these allowances primarily relate to fixed programs, which the customer earns based on purchases of company products during the year. discounts and allowances are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale. while many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts, certain of the allowances, such as the returns allowance, are based on market data, historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation.
for its allowance programs that are not fixed, such as returns, the company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions. these estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues. during 2015, there were no material adjustments to the companys estimates made in prior years.
program production costs the company incurs certain costs in connection with the production of television programs and films based primarily on the companys toy and game brands. these costs are capitalized as they are incurred and amortized using the individual-film-forecast method, whereby these costs are amortized in the proportion that the current years revenues bear to managements estimate of total ultimate revenues as of the beginning of each fiscal year related to the program. these capitalized costs are reported at the lower of cost, less accumulated amortization, or fair value, and reviewed for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates that impairment may exist. the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily based on managements future revenue and cost estimates.
the most significant estimates are those used in the determination of ultimate revenue in the individual-film-forecast method. ultimate revenue estimates impact the timing of program production cost amortization in the consolidated statements of operations. ultimate revenue includes revenue from all sources that are estimated to be earned related to the film or television program and include toy, game and other consumer product licensing fees; first run program distribution fees; and other revenue sources, such as dvd and digital distribution. our ultimate revenue estimates for each film or television program are developed based on our estimates of expected future results. we review and revise these estimates at each reporting date to reflect the most current available information. when estimates for a film or television program are revised, the difference between the program production cost amortization determined using the revised estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year, are included as an adjustment to program production cost amortization in the consolidated statements of operations in the quarter in which the estimates are revised. prior period amounts are not adjusted for subsequent changes in estimates. factors that can impact our revenue estimates include the success and popularity of our films and television programs in the u.s. which are primarily distributed on discovery family channel, globally to other broadcasters and available on netflix and itunes, and success of our program-related toy, game and other merchandise.
for the year ended december 27, 2015 we have $75.5 million of program production and film costs included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. we currently expect that a significant portion of capitalized program production costs will be amortized over the 3-year period 2016 through 2018. future program production cost amortization is subject to change based on actual costs incurred and managements then
48
current estimates of ultimate revenues. during 2014 and 2013 the company recorded accelerated amortization on certain television programming based on revised ultimate expected revenues.
recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually. if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, the company will perform an interim test at that time. the company may perform a qualitative assessment and bypass the quantitative two-step impairment process if it is not more likely than not that impairment exists.
performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill requires a high degree of judgment regarding assumptions underlying the valuation. qualitative factors and their impact on critical inputs are assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. if it is more likely than not that impairment exists, the quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test is performed. when performing the quantitative two-step impairment test, goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is calculated using an income approach. during the fourth quarter of 2015, the company performed a qualitative assessment with respect to certain of its reporting units with goodwill totaling $473.6 million. the company utilized this approach for all reporting units with the exception of backflip based on the amount by which historical estimated reporting unit fair values exceeded carrying values. based on its qualitative assessment, the company concluded that there was no impairment of this goodwill during 2015. the company has $119.1 million of goodwill related to its 2013 acquisition of backflip, which represents a separate reporting unit. the companys strategy when it purchased its interest in backflip was to produce game titles based on backflips dragonvale brand and to develop and market games based on hasbro brands. because backflip was a recent acquisition and to date has been investment spending in anticipation of 2016 game releases, the company performed the quantitative two-step impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2015 for this reporting unit. the impairment test utilized cash flows expected to be generated from mobile gaming offerings, including 2016 releases based on backflips dragonvale brand, as well as several hasbro branded-game titles. the underlying cash flows are based on long-term financial plans for backflip, which include projections for growth in revenues and profitability. the company used a discount rate commensurate with the digital gaming industry. based on the results of the impairment test, the company concluded that there was no impairment as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. the fair value would have to decline by 20% in order for this asset to be impaired. should backflip not achieve its profitability and growth targets, including the anticipated game releases in 2016, or if industry discount rates significantly increase, the carrying value of this reporting unit may become impaired.
the company also performed quantitative annual impairment tests related to intangible assets totaling $75.7 million with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of 2015 and no impairments were indicated as the estimated fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values of the related assets.
the estimation of future cash flows utilized in the evaluation of the companys goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge.
intangible assets, other than those with indefinite lives, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. if such assets were considered to be impaired, the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows. the

estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective assets and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. intangible assets covered under this policy were $205.1 million at december 27, 2015. during 2015, there were no impairment charges related to these intangible assets.
recoverability of royalty advances and commitments the companys ability to earn-out royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product. if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or, if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments, a charge to royalty expense to write-off the non-recoverable minimum guaranty is required. the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates. actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties. at december 27, 2015, the company had $124.3 million of prepaid royalties, $47.5 million of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $76.8 million of which are included in other assets. during 2015 there were no significant charges related to this policy.
pension costs and obligations pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets and applicable discount rates. at the end of 2007 the company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in the u.s., with no future benefits accruing to employees. during 2015 the company froze benefits under its other funded u.s. pension plan. the company will continue to pay benefits under the plans consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze. the company uses its fiscal year-end date as its measurement date to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the expense for the upcoming year.
the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan, the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes, and the current economic environment. based on this information, the companys estimate of expected return on plan assets used in the calculation of 2015 pension expense for the u.s. plans was 7.00%. a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense, while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense. a decrease of 0.25% in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2015 pension expense for u.s. plans by approximately $0.7 million.
discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. the companys weighted average discount rate for its u.s. plans used for the calculation of 2015 pension expense was 4.19%. a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense. a decrease of 0.25% in the companys discount rate would have increased 2015 pension expense by approximately $0.5 million.
actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and, if outside a certain corridor, amortized over future periods and, therefore affect recognized expense in future periods. at december 27, 2015, the companys u.s. plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of $120.5 million included in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to its defined benefit pension plans compared to $124.0 million at december 28, 2014. the discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation at december 27, 2015 increased to
50
4.58% from 4.19% used at december 28, 2014. a decrease of 0.25% in the companys discount rate would have increased the 2015 projected benefit obligation by approximately $10.9 million. pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date. these changes in the fair market value of plan assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses or gains.
income taxes the companys annual income tax rate is based on its income, statutory tax rates, changes in prior tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the companys annual tax rate and evaluates its tax positions. despite the companys belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable, these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities are established in the event that these positions are challenged and the company is not successful in defending these challenges. these estimated liabilities, as well as the related interest, are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit.
an estimated effective income tax rate is applied to the companys interim results. in the event there is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the companys interim results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time. in addition, changes in judgment regarding likely outcomes related to tax positions taken in a prior fiscal year, or tax costs or benefits from a resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely in the interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs. during 2014, the company recorded a net benefit of approximately $20.0 million associated with discrete tax events, primarily related to the completion of u.s. and mexico tax examinations as well as certain other u.s. and foreign prior period tax adjustments. during 2014 the company paid approximately $65.0 million to settle tax assessments and years subject to audit from 2000 through 2013 in mexico. the company incurred additional tax expense in 2014 of $6.9 million related to this settlement.
in certain cases, tax law requires items to be included in the companys income tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized on the consolidated financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized on the consolidated financial statements. some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the companys tax returns, while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. these differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. deferred tax assets represent deductions that have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the companys income tax returns. valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the company will have insufficient future taxable income, including capital gains, to fully realize the future deductions or capital losses. deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized on the companys income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the companys consolidated financial statements or income recognized in the consolidated financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the companys income tax return. deferred income taxes have not been provided on most of the undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as most of such earnings are indefinitely reinvested by the company. in the event the company determines that such earnings will not be indefinitely reinvested, it would be required to accrue for any additional income taxes representing the difference between the tax rates in the united states and the applicable tax rates of the international subsidiaries. at december 27, 2015, the difference between the tax in the united states and the applicable tax of the international subsidiaries on cumulative undistributed earnings was approximately $548.0 million.

a                                                    in connection with the companys agreement to form a joint venture with discovery, the company is obligated to make future payments to discovery under a tax sharing agreement. these payments are contingent upon the company having sufficient taxable income to realize the expected tax deductions of certain amounts related to the joint venture. accordingly, estimates of these amounts are included in the table above.

b                                               purchase commitments represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase inventory and tooling in the ordinary course of business as well as purchase commitments under a manufacturing agreement. the reported amounts exclude inventory and tooling purchase liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 27, 2015.

theatrical contingencies the table above excludes up to $70.0 million in guaranteed royalties related to the companys license agreement related to marvel as such amounts are contingent on the quantity and type of theatrical movie releases and may be payable during the next six years. the company expects to pay approximately $40.0 million of these additional royalties in 2016 based on expected qualifying theatrical releases.
the table above also excludes $100.0 million in guaranteed royalties related to the companys license agreement related to star wars as the amount and timing of such payments are due in accordance with the anticipated releases of new star wars theatrical releases in 2017 and beyond.
other expected future payments from time to time, the company may be party to arrangements, contractual or otherwise, whereby the company may not be able to estimate the ultimate timing or amount of the related payments. as such, these amounts have been excluded from the table above and described below.
                                                   the company holds a 70% stake in backflip and may be required to purchase the remaining 30% in the future contingent on the achievement by backflip of certain predetermined financial performance metrics. the company does not know the ultimate timing of when these predetermined financial performance metrics may be met and, therefore, cannot currently estimate the purchase price of the remaining
30%.

                  included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at december 27, 2015, the company has a liability of $68.3 million of potential tax, interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in various income tax returns. the company does not know the ultimate

52
resolution of these uncertain tax positions and as such, does not know the ultimate amount or timing of payments related to this liability.

   the company expects to make contributions totaling approximately $3.6 million related to its unfunded u.s. and other international pension plans in
2016.

   at december 27, 2015, the company had letters of credit and related instruments of approximately $24.5 million.

the company believes that cash from operations and funds available through its commercial paper program or lines of credit will allow the company to meet these and other obligations described above.
financial risk management the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in u.s. dollars and hong kong dollars while marketing and selling those products in more than twenty currencies. results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the u.s. dollar, hong kong dollar, euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, brazilian real, russian ruble and mexican peso and, to a lesser extent, other currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries.
to manage this exposure, the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts. the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10% depreciation of the u.s. dollar against all foreign currencies included in these foreign exchange forward contracts could result in an approximate $124.6 million decrease in the fair value of these instruments. a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the value of the forecasted foreign currency transactions.
the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short-term borrowing positions in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. the company believes, however, that the on-going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition. in addition, the companys revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. a significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the companys revenues and earnings due to translation of foreign-denominated revenues and expenses. the company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange. from time to time, affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency. the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts.
the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets. the company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts. at december 27, 2015, these contracts had net unrealized gains of $106.4 million, of which $73.0 million are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets, $34.7 million are recorded in other assets, ($1.1) million are recorded in accrued liabilities and ($0.2) million are recorded to other liabilities. included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at december 27, 2015 are deferred gains of $98.7 million, net of tax, related to these derivatives.
at december 27, 2015, the company had fixed rate long-term debt of $1,559.9 million. of this long-term debt, $600.0 million represents the aggregate issuance of long-term debt in may 2014 which consists of $300.0 million of 3.15% notes due 2021 and $300.0 million of 5.10% notes due 2044. prior to the may 2014 debt issuance, the company entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of $500.0 million to hedge the anticipated underlying u.s. treasury interest rate. these interest rate swaps were matched with this debt issuance and were designated and effective as hedges of the change in future interest payments. at the date of issuance, the company terminated these swap agreements and their fair value at the date of issuance was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being amortized through the consolidated statements of operations using an effective interest rate method over the life of the related debt. included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december 27, 2015 are deferred losses, net of tax, of $19.4 million related to these derivatives.
53
the economy and inflation the principal market for the companys products is the retail sector. revenues from the companys top five customers, all retailers, accounted for approximately 39% of its consolidated net revenues in 2015 and 38% and 39% of its consolidated net revenues in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate.
the companys revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year. in 2015, approximately 66% of the companys full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year. the company expects that this concentration will continue. the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of (a) underproduction of popular items, (b) overproduction of less popular items, and (c) failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules. the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line, product availability, marketing strategies, inventory levels, policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions. larger retailers generally maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season, which includes christmas.
quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in orders increasingly placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders placed well in advance of shipment. retailers are timing their orders so that they are filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers. to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their year-end inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated, their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed, thus negatively impacting the companys future revenues. in addition, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the companys significant retailers could negatively impact the companys future revenues.
the effect of inflation on the companys operations during 2015 was not significant and the company will continue its practice of monitoring costs and adjusting prices, accordingly.
other information the company is not aware of any material amounts of potential exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material to its operating results or financial position.

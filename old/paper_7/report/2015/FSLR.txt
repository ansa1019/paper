executive overview we are a leading global provider of comprehensive pv solar energy solutions. we design, manufacture, and sell pv solar modules with an advanced thin-film semiconductor technology and also develop, design, construct, and sell pv solar power systems that primarily use the modules we manufacture. additionally, we provide o&m services to system owners that use solar modules manufactured by us or by other third-party manufacturers. we have substantial, ongoing research and development efforts focused on module and system level innovations. we are the world's largest thin-film pv solar module manufacturer and one of the world's largest pv solar module manufacturers. our mission is to create enduring value by enabling a world powered by clean, affordable solar energy.
certain highlights of our financial results and other key developments include the following:
•   net sales for 2015 increased by 6% to $3.6 billion compared to $3.4 billion in 2014. the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to higher revenue from module plus transactions. our net sales for 2015 also included the sale of majority interests in the partially constructed desert stateline project and north star project and higher revenue from our silver state south, mccoy, and imperial solar energy center west projects, which commenced construction in late 2014. these 2015 net sales were offset by lower revenue from the completion, or substantial completion, of our desert sunlight, solar gen 2, topaz, and campo verde projects in 2014.
•   gross profit increased 1.4 percentage points to 25.7% during 2015 from 24.3% during 2014, primarily due to a reduction in our module collection and recycling obligation and improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities.
•   as of december 31, 2015, we had 30 installed production lines with an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately 2.8 gw at our manufacturing facilities in perrysburg, ohio and kulim, malaysia. we produced 2.5 gw of solar modules during 2015, which represented a 39% increase from 2014. the increase in production was primarily driven by the restart of various production lines at our manufacturing facility in malaysia, increased throughput, and higher module conversion efficiencies. we expect to produce approximately 3.0 gw of solar modules during 2016.
•   during 2015, we ran our manufacturing facilities at approximately 92% capacity utilization, which represented an 11.0 percentage point increase from 2014.
•   the average conversion efficiency of our modules produced in 2015 was 15.6%, which represented an improvement of 1.6 percentage points from our average conversion efficiency of 14.0% in 2014.

market overview the solar industry continues to be characterized by intense pricing competition, both at the module and system levels. in the aggregate, we believe manufacturers of solar modules and cells have, relative to global demand, significant installed production capacity and the ability for additional capacity expansion. we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand (i.e., where production capacity exceeds global demand), and that such periods will put pressure on pricing. additionally, intense competition at the system level can result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly, thereby further increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers, epc companies, and vertically-integrated solar companies such as first solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability. in light of such market realities, we are executing our long term strategic plan, vision 2020 described below, under which we are focusing on our competitive strengths. such strengths include our advanced module and system technologies as well as our differentiated, vertically-integrated business model that enables us to provide utility-scale pv solar energy solutions to key geographic markets with immediate electricity needs.
worldwide solar markets continue to develop, in part aided by demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices, both at the module and system level, which make solar power more affordable to new markets, and we have continued to develop our localized presence and expertise in such markets. we are developing, constructing, or operating multiple solar projects around the world, many of which are the largest or among the largest in their regions. in north america, we continue to execute on our advanced-stage utility-scale project pipeline, which includes the construction of some of the world's largest pv solar power systems. we expect a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales, operating income, and cash flows through the end of 2016 to be derived from these projects. we continue to advance the development and selling efforts for the other projects included in our advanced-stage utility-scale project pipeline and also continue to develop our early-to-mid stage project pipeline and evaluate acquisitions of projects to continue to add to our advanced-stage utility-scale project pipeline.
lower industry module and system pricing, while currently challenging for certain solar manufacturers (particularly manufacturers with high cost structures), is expected to continue to contribute to global market diversification and volume elasticity. over time, declining average selling prices are consistent with the erosion of one of the primary historical constraints to widespread solar market penetration, its affordability. in the near term, however, declining average selling prices could adversely affect our results of operations. if competitors reduce pricing to levels below their costs, bid aggressively low prices for ppas and epc agreements, or are able to operate at negative or minimal operating margins for sustained periods of time, our results of operations could be further adversely affected. we continue to mitigate this uncertainty in part by executing on and building our advanced-stage utility-scale systems pipeline, executing on our module efficiency improvement and bos cost reduction roadmaps, and continuing the development of key geographic markets.
we continue to face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and other types of solar modules and pv solar power systems. solar module manufacturers compete with one another in several product performance attributes, including conversion efficiency, energy density, reliability, and selling price per watt, and, with respect to pv solar power systems, net present value, return on equity, and lcoe, meaning the net present value of total life cycle costs of the pv solar power system divided by the quantity of energy which is expected to be produced over the system's life.
we believe we are among the lowest cost pv module manufacturers in the solar industry on a module cost per watt basis, based on publicly available information. this cost competitiveness is reflected in the price at which we sell our modules and fully integrated pv solar power systems and enables our systems to compete favorably. our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our module conversion efficiency, proprietary manufacturing technology (which enables us to produce a cdte module in less than 2.5 hours using a continuous and highly automated industrial manufacturing process, as opposed to a batch process), our scale, and our operational excellence. in addition, our cdte modules use approximately 1-2% of the amount of the semiconductor material that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules. the cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules, and the timing and rate of change in the cost of silicon feedstock and polysilicon could lead to changes in solar module pricing levels. polysilicon costs have had periods of decline over the past several years, contributing to a decline in our relative manufacturing cost competitiveness over traditional crystalline silicon module manufacturers. given the smaller size (sometimes referred to as form factor) of our cdte modules compared to certain types of crystalline silicon modules, we may incur higher labor and bos costs associated with systems using our modules. thus, to compete effectively on an lcoe basis, our modules may need to maintain a certain cost advantage per watt compared to crystalline silicon-based modules with larger form factors. bos costs represent a significant portion of the costs associated with the construction of a typical utility-scale pv solar power system.
47
in terms of energy density, in many climates, our cdte modules provide a significant energy yield advantage over conventional crystalline silicon solar modules of equivalent efficiency rating. for example, in humid climates, our cdte modules provide a superior spectral response, and in hot climates, our cdte modules provide a superior temperature coefficient. as a result, at temperatures above 25°c (standard test conditions), our cdte modules produce more energy than competing conventional crystalline silicon solar modules with an equivalent efficiency rating. this advantage provides stronger system performance in high temperature climates, which is particularly advantageous as the vast majority of a system's generation, on average (in typical high insolation climates), occurs when module temperatures are above 25°c. as a result, our pv solar power systems can produce more annual energy at a lower lcoe than competing systems with the same nameplate capacity.
while our modules and pv solar power systems are generally competitive in cost, reliability, and performance attributes, there can be no guarantee such competitiveness will continue to exist in the future to the same extent or at all. any declines in the competitiveness of our products could result in additional margin compression, further declines in the average selling prices of our modules and systems, erosion in our market share for modules and systems, decreases in the rate of net sales growth, and/or declines in overall net sales. we continue to focus on enhancing the competitiveness of our solar modules and pv solar power systems by accelerating progress along our module efficiency improvement and bos cost reduction roadmaps, continuing to make technological advances at the system level, leveraging volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms, using innovative installation techniques and know-how, and accelerating installation times to reduce labor costs.
as we continue to expand our systems business into key geographic markets, we can offer value beyond solar modules, reduce our exposure to module-only competition, provide differentiated product offerings to minimize the impact of solar module commoditization, and provide comprehensive utility-scale pv solar power system solutions that reduce solar electricity costs. thus, our systems business allows us to play a more active role than many of our competitors in managing the demand for our solar modules. finally, we continue to form and develop strong relationships with our customers and strategic partners around the world and continue to refine our product offerings, including epc capabilities and o&m services, in order to enhance the competitiveness of systems using our modules. for example, we have formed, and expect in the future to form, joint ventures or other business arrangements with project developers in certain strategic markets in order to provide our modules and utility-scale pv solar energy solutions to the projects developed by such ventures.
certain trends and uncertainties we believe that our operations may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by the following trends and uncertainties that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. see item 1a: "risk factors" and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of other risks that may affect our financial condition and results of operations.
long term strategic plan, vision 2020
our long term strategic plan, vision 2020 is a long-term roadmap to achieve our growth objectives and our technology and cost leadership goals. in executing our long term strategic plan, we are focusing on providing utility-scale pv solar energy solutions using our modules to key geographic markets that we believe have a compelling need for mass-scale pv electricity, including markets throughout the americas, asia, the middle east, and africa. as part of our long term strategic plan, we are focusing on opportunities in which our pv solar energy solutions can compete directly with fossil fuel offerings on an lcoe or similar basis, or complement such fossil fuel electricity offerings. execution of the long term strategic plan entails a prioritization of market opportunities worldwide relative to our core strengths and a corresponding allocation of resources around the globe. this prioritization involves a focus on our core utility-scale offerings and exists within a current market environment that includes rooftop and distributed generation solar, particularly in the u.s. while it is unclear how rooftop and distributed generation solar might impact our core utility-scale offerings in the next several years, we believe that utility-scale solar will continue to be a compelling solar offering for companies with technology and cost leadership and will continue to represent an increasing portion of the overall electricity generation mix.
we are closely evaluating and managing the appropriate level of resources required as we pursue the most advantageous and cost effective projects and partnerships in our target markets. we have dedicated, and intend to continue to dedicate, significant capital and human resources to reduce the total installed cost of pv solar energy, to optimize the design and logistics around our pv solar energy solutions, and to ensure that our solutions integrate well into the overall electricity ecosystem of each specific market. we expect that, over time, an increasing portion of our consolidated net sales, operating income, and cash flows may come from solar offerings in the key geographic markets described above as we execute on our long term strategic plan. the timing, execution, and financial impacts of our long term strategic plan are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described in item 1a: "risk factors," and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. we are focusing our resources in those markets and energy applications in which solar power can be a least-cost, best-fit energy solution, particularly in regions with high solar resources, significant current or projected electricity demand, and/or relatively high existing electricity prices. as part of these efforts, we
48
continue to expand or reallocate resources globally, including business development, sales personnel, and other supporting professional staff in target markets. accordingly, we may shift current costs or incur additional costs over time as we establish a localized business presence in these target markets.
joint ventures or other strategic arrangements with partners are a key part of our long term strategic plan, and we generally use such arrangements to expedite our penetration of various key markets and establish relationships with potential customers. we also enter into joint ventures or strategic arrangements with customers or other entities to maximize the value of particular projects. some of these arrangements involve and are expected in the future to involve significant investments or other allocations of capital. we continue to develop relationships with policymakers, regulators, and end customers in these strategic markets with a view to creating opportunities for utility-scale pv solar power systems. we sell such systems directly to end customers, including utilities, independent power producers, commercial and industrial companies, and other system owners. depending on the market opportunity, our sales offerings may range from module-only sales, to module sales with a range of development, epc services, and other solutions, to full turn-key pv solar power system sales. we expect these offerings to continue to evolve over time as we work with our customers to optimize how our pv solar energy solutions can best meet our customers' energy and economic needs.
in order to create or maintain a market position in certain strategically targeted markets, our offerings from time to time may need to be competitively priced at levels associated with minimal gross profit margins, which may adversely affect our results of operations. we expect the profitability associated with our various sales offerings to vary from one another over time, and possibly vary from our internal long-range profitability expectations and targets, depending on the market opportunity and the relative competitiveness of our offerings compared with other energy solutions, fossil fuel-based or otherwise, that are available to potential customers. in addition, as we execute on our long term strategic plan, we will continue to monitor and adapt to any changing dynamics in the market set of potential buyers of solar project assets. market environments with few potential project buyers and a higher cost of capital would generally exert downward pressure on the potential revenue from the uncontracted solar project assets we are developing, whereas, conversely, market environments with many potential project buyers and a lower cost of capital would likely have a favorable impact on the potential revenue from such uncontracted solar project assets.
we expect to use our working capital, the availability under our revolving credit facility, or project financing to finance the construction of certain pv solar power systems for strategic purposes or to maximize the value of such systems at the time of sale. from time to time, we may temporarily own and operate certain pv solar power systems, often with the intention to sell at a later date. we may also elect to construct and temporarily retain ownership interests in systems for which there is no ppa with an off-taker, such as a utility, but rather an intent to sell the electricity produced by the system on an open contract basis until the system is sold. we also continue to assess and pursue business arrangements that provide access to a lower cost of capital and optimize the value of our projects. business arrangements that provide a competitive cost of capital and other benefits relating to the project sales process, such as our recently formed yieldco (as described below and under the heading "8point3 energy partners lp"), have been used increasingly by renewable energy companies. additionally, our joint ventures and other business arrangements with strategic partners have and may in the future result in us temporarily retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest in the underlying systems projects we develop, supply modules to, or construct potentially for a period of up to several years. such business arrangements could become increasingly important to our competitive profile in markets globally, including north america. in each of the above mentioned examples, we may retain such ownership interests in a consolidated or unconsolidated separate entity.
8point3 energy partners lp as previously disclosed in a current report on form 8-k filed with the sec on june 30, 2015, 8point3 energy partners lp (the "partnership"), a limited partnership formed by first solar and sunpower (the "sponsors"), completed its initial public offering (the "ipo") in june 2015. as part of the ipo, we contributed various projects to a subsidiary of the partnership in exchange for a 31% interest in the entity. we also received a distribution of $283.7 million following the ipo. the partnership owns, operates, and is expected to acquire additional solar energy generation projects from the sponsors and is expected to provide a competitive cost of capital and greater optionality in the project sales process. the partnership's initial project portfolio includes interests in more than 0.4 gw of various solar energy generation projects, and the partnership also has rights of first offer on interests in over 1.1 gw of additional solar energy generation projects that are currently contracted or are expected to be contracted prior to being sold by the sponsors. given the broader economic factors currently impacting the yieldco sector in general, including yieldco equity valuations generally, the timing and execution of asset drop downs to the partnership are subject to market conditions. for additional information, see item 1a: "risk factors - we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the formation of 8point3 energy partners lp, on a timely basis or at all" and "note 12. investments in unconsolidated affiliates and joint ventures - 8point3 energy partners lp" of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
49
construction of some of the world's largest pv solar power systems we continue to execute on our advanced-stage utility-scale project pipeline and expect a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales, operating income, and cash flows through 2016 to be derived from several large projects in this pipeline, including the following contracted projects which will be among the world's largest pv solar power systems: the 300 mw desert stateline project, located in san bernardino county, california; the 250 mw mccoy solar energy project, located in riverside county, california; the 250 mw silver state south project, located in clark county, nevada; the 175 mw astoria project, located in kern county, california; and the 150 mw imperial solar energy center west project, located in imperial county, california. our advanced stage utility-scale project pipeline also includes the following projects which are not yet sold or contracted: the 280 mw california flats project, located in monterey county, california; the 250 mw moapa project, located in clark county, nevada; the 150 mw rosamond project located in kern county, california; the 150 mw sun streams project, located in maricopa county, arizona; and the 141 mw luz del norte project located near copiapó, chile. please see the tables under "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - systems project pipeline" for additional information about these and other projects within our systems business advanced-stage project pipeline. the construction progress of these projects is subject to risks and delays as described in item 1a: "risk factors," and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. revenue recognition for these and other system projects is in many cases not linear in nature due to the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria are met, and consequently, period-over-period comparisons of results of operations may not be meaningful. expected revenue from projects without a ppa, for which electricity will be sold on an open contract basis, may be subject to greater variability and uncertainty based on market factors compared to projects with a ppa.
systems project pipeline the following tables summarize, as of february 23, 2016, our approximately 3.8 gw systems business advanced-stage project pipeline. as of december 31, 2015, for the projects sold/under contract in our advanced-stage project pipeline of approximately 1.6 gw, we have recognized revenue with respect to the equivalent of approximately 0.9 gw. such mw equivalent amount refers to the ratio of revenue recognized for the projects sold/under contract compared to the total contracted revenue for such projects, multiplied by the total mw for such projects. the remaining revenue to be recognized subsequent to december 31, 2015 for the projects sold/under contract is expected to be approximately $1.7 billion. the majority of such amount is expected to be recognized as revenue through the later of the substantial completion or closing dates of the projects. the remaining revenue to be recognized does not have a direct correlation to expected remaining module shipments for such projects sold/under contract as expected module shipments do not represent total systems revenues and do not consider the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria are met, including the timing of module installation. the actual volume of modules installed in our projects sold/under contract will be greater than the project size in mw ac as module volumes required for a project are based upon mw dc, which will be greater than the mw ac size pursuant to a dc-ac ratio typically ranging from 1.2 to 1.3. such ratio varies across different projects due to various system design factors. projects are removed from our advanced-stage project pipeline tables below once we have substantially completed construction and after substantially all revenue has been recognized. projects or portions of projects may also be removed from the tables below in the event an epc-contracted or partner-developed project does not get permitting or financing or an unsold or uncontracted project does not get sold or contracted due to the changing economics of the project or other factors.
we continually seek to make additions to our advanced-stage project pipeline. we are actively developing our early to mid-stage project pipeline in order to secure ppas and are also pursuing opportunities to acquire advanced-stage projects, which already have ppas in place. new additions to our project pipeline during the period from february 25, 2015 to february 23, 2016 included 250 mw ac of solar power projects in california, 279 mw ac of solar power projects in nevada, a 150 mw ac solar power project in arizona, a 119 mw ac solar power project in texas, a 103 mw ac solar power project in georgia, 99 mw ac of solar power projects in japan, 55 mw ac of solar power projects in india, a 26 mw ac solar power project in honduras, and an 18 mw ac solar power project in turkey.

segment overview we operate our business in two segments. our components segment involves the design, manufacture, and sale of solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity, and our systems segment includes the development, construction, operation, and maintenance of pv solar power systems, which primarily use our solar modules.
see note 23 "segment and geographical information" to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2015 included in this annual report on form 10-k. see also item 7: "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - systems project pipeline" for a description of the system projects in our advanced-stage project pipeline.
product revenue the following table sets forth the total amounts of solar module and solar power system net sales for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. for the purpose of the following table, (i) solar module revenue is composed of total net sales from the sale of solar modules to third parties, and (ii) solar power system revenue is composed of total net sales from the sale of pv solar power systems and related services and solutions including the solar modules installed in the systems we develop and construct along with revenue generated from such systems (in thousands):
2015                    2014                    2013
solar module revenue                  $227,461                $228,319                $380,869
solar power system revenue           3,351,534               3,162,868               2,928,747

solar module revenue to third parties decreased by $0.9 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a 10% decrease in the average selling price per watt, partially offset by an 11% increase in the volume of watts sold.
solar power system revenue increased by $188.7 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher revenue from module plus transactions. our net sales for 2015 also included the sale of majority interests in the partially constructed desert stateline project and north star project and higher revenue from our silver state south, mccoy, and imperial energy center west projects, which commenced construction in late 2014. these 2015 net sales were offset by lower revenue from the completion, or substantial completion, of our desert sunlight, solar gen 2, topaz, and campo verde projects in 2014.
solar module revenue to third parties decreased by $152.6 million during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of a 26% decrease in the volume of watts sold and a 19% decrease in the average selling price per watt.
solar power system revenue increased by $234.1 million during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the number and size of projects under construction between these periods as well as the timing of when all the revenue recognition criteria was met. specifically, the increase was attributable to higher revenue from the partial sale of our solar gen 2 project, the sale of our campo verde and macho springs projects, and the commencement of construction and related revenue recognition on multiple projects in california and our agl nyngan project in australia. these increases were partially offset by decreases in systems business project revenue from our desert sunlight project as it neared substantial completion, our completed first phase of the imperial solar energy center south project and our completed amherstburg, belmont, walpole, and agua caliente projects.
net sales components business we generally price and sell our solar modules per watt of nameplate power. during 2015, a significant portion of net sales for the components business related to modules included in our pv solar power systems described below under "net sales - systems business." other than the modules included in our systems, we sold the majority of our solar modules to integrators and operators of systems in india and great britain.
from time to time we enter into module sales agreements with customers worldwide for specific projects or volumes of modules. such agreements are generally short-term in nature. during 2015, 11% and 8% of our components business net sales, excluding modules installed in our pv solar power systems, were denominated in british pounds and euros, respectively, and were subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate between such currencies and the u.s. dollar.
under our standard sales contracts for solar modules, we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment. pricing is typically fixed or determinable at the time of shipment, and our customers generally do not have extended payment terms or rights of return under these contracts. our revenue recognition policies for the components business are described further in note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2015 included in this annual report on form 10-k.
during 2015, southern power company; strata solar, llc; and nextera energy, inc. each accounted for more than 10% of our components business' net sales, which includes the solar modules used in our systems projects.
systems business through our fully integrated systems business, we provide complete turn-key pv solar power systems, or solar solutions, which may include project development, epc services, and/or o&m services. additionally, we may temporarily own and operate certain of our pv solar power systems, which are also included within our systems business. we typically use the percentage-of-completion method using actual costs incurred over total estimated costs to construct a project (including module costs) as our standard accounting policy and apply this method after all revenue recognition criteria have been met. there are also instances in which we recognize revenue after a project has been completed, primarily due to a project not being sold prior to completion or because all revenue recognition criteria are not met until the project is completed. our revenue recognition policies for the systems business are described in further detail in note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2015 included in this annual report on form 10-k.
during 2015, the majority of our systems business net sales were generated in north america, and the principal customers of our systems business were nextera energy, inc. and southern power company, each of which accounted for more than 10% of the segment's net sales.

net sales from our components segment, which includes solar modules used in our systems projects, increased by $286.9 million in 2015 primarily due to a 33% increase in the volume of watts sold, partially offset by a 5% decrease in the average selling price per watt. net sales from our systems segment, which excludes solar modules used in our systems projects, decreased by $99.1 million in 2015 primarily as a result of lower revenue from the completion, or substantial completion, of our desert sunlight, solar gen 2, topaz, and campo verde projects in 2014. these decreases were partially offset by the sale of majority interests in the partially constructed desert stateline project and north star project, and higher revenue from our silver state south, mccoy, and imperial solar energy center west projects, which commenced construction in late 2014.
net sales from our components segment, which includes solar modules used in our systems projects, decreased by $71.3 million in 2014 primarily due to a 12% decrease in the average selling price per watt, partially offset by a 7% increase in the volume of watts sold. net sales from our systems segment, which excludes solar modules used in our systems projects, increased by $152.8 million in 2014 primarily as a result of the number and size of projects under construction between these periods as well as the timing of when all the revenue recognition criteria have been met. specifically, the increase was attributable to higher revenue from the partial sale of our solar gen 2 project, the sale of our campo verde and macho springs projects, and the commencement of construction and related revenue recognition on multiple projects in california and our agl nyngan project in australia. these increases were partially offset by decreases in systems business project revenue from our desert sunlight project as it neared substantial completion, our completed first phase of the imperial solar energy center south project and our completed amherstburg, belmont, walpole, and agua caliente projects.
cost of sales components business our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components for manufacturing solar modules, such as glass, transparent conductive coatings, cadmium telluride and other thin-film semiconductors, laminate materials, connector assemblies, edge seal materials, and other materials and components. in addition, our cost of sales includes direct labor for the manufacturing of solar modules and manufacturing overhead such as engineering, equipment maintenance, environmental health and safety, quality and production control, information technology, and procurement costs. our cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment, facility-related expenses, and costs associated with shipping, warranties, and our solar module collection and recycling obligation (excluding accretion).
as further described in note 23 "segment and geographical information" to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2015 included within this annual report on form 10-k, we include the sale of our solar modules manufactured by our components business and used by our systems business within net sales of our components business. therefore, the related cost of sales is also included within our components business.
systems business for our systems business, project-related costs include standard epc costs (consisting primarily of bos costs for inverters, electrical and mounting hardware, project management and engineering costs, and construction labor costs), site specific costs, and development costs (including nonrefundable transmission upgrade costs, interconnection fees, and permitting costs).

our cost of sales increased $93.5 million, or 4%, and decreased 1.4 percentage points as a percentage of net sales when comparing 2015 with 2014. the increase in cost of sales was driven by a $60.9 million increase in our systems segment cost of sales primarily due to a mix of lower gross profit system projects sold or under construction during the period. our components segment cost of sales increased by a $32.6 million primarily as a result of the following:
•   higher costs of $309.4 million associated with the increased volume of modules sold as part of our systems business projects; partially offset by
•   continued manufacturing cost reductions of $135.1 million;
•   a reduction in our module collection and recycling obligation of $69.6 million resulting from the implementation of advanced recycling technologies, which significantly increased the throughput of modules able to be recycled at a point in time, along with other material and labor cost reductions; and
•   lower underutilization penalties of $55.0 million due to the improved capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities. during 2015, we ran our factories at approximately 92% capacity utilization, which represented an 11.0 percentage point increase from 2014.
our costs of sales increased $121.3 million, or 5%, and increased 1.8 percentage points as a percentage of net sales when comparing 2014 with 2013. the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to a $197.5 million increase in our systems segment cost of sales primarily for bos components and other construction and development costs related to the number of projects and the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria were met along with a mix of higher cost projects. these increases were partially offset by a $76.3 million reduction in cost of sales for our components segment primarily due to the following:
•   continued manufacturing cost reductions of $164.9 million and
•lower inventory write-off and asset impairment charges of $16.8 million; partially offset by
•higher costs of $67.9 million associated with increased solar module sales volumes and
•a reduction in our module collection and recycling obligation of $43.3 million recorded during 2013.
gross profit gross profit is affected by numerous factors, including the selling prices of our modules and systems, our manufacturing costs, bos costs, project development costs, the capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities, and foreign exchange rates. gross profit is also affected by the mix of net sales generated by our components and systems businesses. gross profit for our systems business excludes the net sales and cost of sales for solar modules used in our systems projects as these amounts are included in the gross profit of our components business.

components segment income before taxes increased by $277.3 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the increase in net sales resulting from higher volumes of module sold as part of systems projects, the reduction in our module collection and recycling obligation, improved utilization of our manufacturing assets, and lower selling, general and administrative expense. systems segment income before income taxes decreased by $189.6 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of the decrease in net sales, a mix of lower gross profit systems projects sold or under construction during the period, and higher selling, general and administrative expense.
components segment loss before income taxes decreased by $115.7 million during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower restructuring and asset impairment charges related to the sale of our facility in mesa, arizona and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expense mainly driven by less depreciation and amortization expense for certain leasehold improvements and our mesa facility. these reductions were partially offset by a reduction in our module collection and recycling obligation recorded during 2013. systems segment income before income taxes decreased $64.6 million during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of a mix of lower gross profit systems projects sold and under construction in 2014 and higher selling, general and administrative expense. these items were partially offset by favorable changes in estimated costs on systems projects accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method.
income tax benefit (expense)
income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate; principally australia, germany, and malaysia. significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our consolidated income tax expense. in malaysia, we have been granted a long-term tax holiday, scheduled to expire in 2027, pursuant to which substantially all of our income earned in malaysia is exempt from income tax.
the following table shows income tax benefit (expense) for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013:

income tax expense decreased by $37.3 million during 2015 compared to 2014. the decrease in income tax expense was primarily the result of a $41.7 million discrete tax benefit associated with the receipt of a private letter ruling during the period. see note 20 "income taxes" to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2015 included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
income tax expense increased by $1.1 million during 2014 compared with 2013. the increase in income tax expense was primarily attributable to an increase in pretax book income earned in higher tax jurisdictions in 2014, partially offset by a discrete tax benefit due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for various uncertain tax positions. see note 20 "income taxes" to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2015 included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, net of tax increased during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of our investment in 8point3 operating company, llc, a subsidiary of 8point3 energy partners lp, along with the impairments of certain investments during 2014. losses from unconsolidated affiliates increased during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the impairments of certain investments.
liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2015, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash flows from operating activities including the contracted portion of our advanced-stage project pipeline, availability under our revolving credit facility considering minimum liquidity covenant requirements, and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our working capital, systems project investment, and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. we monitor our working capital to ensure we have adequate liquidity, both domestically and internationally. additionally, we have an active shelf registration statement filed with the sec for the issuance of debt or equity securities if needed.
we intend to maintain appropriate debt levels based upon cash flow expectations, our overall cost of capital, and expected cash requirements for operations, capital expenditures, and discretionary strategic spending. in the future, we may also engage in additional debt or equity financings, including project specific debt financings. we believe that when necessary, we will have adequate access to the capital markets, although our ability to raise capital on terms commercially acceptable to us could be constrained if there is insufficient lender or investor interest due to industry-wide or company-specific concerns. such financings could result in increased debt service expenses or dilution to our existing stockholders.
as of december 31, 2015, we had $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities compared with $2.0 billion as of december 31, 2014. cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of december 31, 2015 decreased primarily as the result of financing the construction of certain solar power projects. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and were generally based in u.s. dollar and euro denominated holdings. we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.
our expanding systems business requires liquidity and is expected to continue to have significant liquidity requirements in the future. the net amount of our project assets, deferred project costs, billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings, and payments and billings for deferred project costs, which approximates our net capital investment in the development and construction of systems projects as of december 31, 2015 was $1.2 billion. solar power project development and construction cycles, which span the time between the identification of a site location and the commercial operation of a system, vary substantially and can take many years to mature. as a result of these long project cycles and strategic decisions to finance the construction of certain projects, we may need to make significant up-front investments of resources in advance of the receipt of any cash from the sale
61
of such projects. these up-front investments may include using our working capital, the availability under our revolving credit facility, or entering into project financing arrangements to finance the construction of our systems projects. for example, we may have to complete, or substantially complete, the construction of a systems project before such project is sold. delays in construction progress or in completing the sale of our systems projects that we are self-financing may also impact our liquidity. we have historically financed these up-front systems project investments primarily using working capital. in certain circumstances, we may need to finance construction costs exclusively using working capital, if project financing becomes unavailable due to market-wide, regional, or other concerns.
we are partnering with local developers on project development in markets around the world where we may take an equity stake in a project for a number of years. we are also self-developing projects in such markets where we may hold all or a significant portion of the equity in the projects for several years. given the duration of these investments and the currency risk relative to the u.s. dollar in some of these new markets, we continue to explore local financing alternatives. should these financing alternatives be unavailable or too cost prohibitive, we could be exposed to significant currency risk and our liquidity could be adversely impacted.
additionally, we may elect to retain an ownership interest in certain systems projects after they become operational if we determine it would be of economic and strategic benefit to do so. if, for example, we cannot sell a systems project at economics that are attractive to us or potential customers are unwilling to assume the risks and rewards typical of pv solar power system ownership, we may instead elect to temporarily own and operate such systems until we can sell the systems on economically attractive terms. as with traditional electricity generating assets, the selling price of a pv solar power system could be higher at or post-completion to reflect the elimination of construction and performance risks and other uncertainties. the decision to retain ownership of a system impacts liquidity depending upon the size and cost of the project. as of december 31, 2015, we had $93.7 million of pv solar power systems that have been placed in service. we may elect to enter into temporary or long-term project financing to reduce the impact on our liquidity and working capital. we also formed a limited partnership yieldco vehicle described under "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - certain trends and uncertainties - 8point3 energy partners lp" and may consider entering into tax equity or other arrangements with respect to ownership interests in certain of our projects, which could cause a portion of the economics of such projects to be recognized over time.
the following additional considerations have impacted or may impact our liquidity in 2016 and beyond:
•   the amount of accounts receivable, unbilled and retainage as of december 31, 2015 was $59.2 million, which included $40.2 million of unbilled amounts. these unbilled accounts receivable represent revenue that has been recognized in advance of billing the customer under the terms of the underlying construction contracts. such construction costs have been funded with working capital, and the unbilled amounts are expected to be billed and collected from customers during the next 12 months. once we meet the billing criteria under a construction contract, we bill our customers accordingly and reclassify the accounts receivable, unbilled and retainage to accounts receivable trade, net. the amount of accounts receivable, unbilled and retainage as of december 31, 2015 also included $19.0 million of retainage, which represents the portion of a systems project contract price earned by us for work performed, but held for payment by our customer as a form of security until we reach certain construction milestones. such retainage amounts relate to construction costs incurred and construction work already performed.
•   the amount of solar module inventory and bos parts as of december 31, 2015 was $446.3 million. as we continue with the construction of our advanced-stage project pipeline, we must produce solar modules and procure bos parts in the required volumes to support our planned construction schedules. as part of this construction cycle, we typically must manufacture modules or acquire the necessary bos parts for construction activities in advance of receiving payment for such materials, which may temporarily reduce our liquidity. once solar modules and bos parts are installed in a project, such installed amounts are classified as either project assets, deferred project costs, pv solar power systems, or cost of sales depending upon whether the project is subject to a definitive sales contract and whether all revenue recognition criteria have been met. as of december 31, 2015, $237.5 million, or 77%, of our solar module inventory was either on-site or in-transit to our systems projects. all bos parts are for our systems business projects.
•   we may commit working capital during 2016 and beyond to acquire solar power projects in various stages of development, including advanced-stage projects with ppas, and to continue developing those projects as necessary. depending upon the size and stage of development, costs to acquire such solar power projects could be significant. when evaluating project acquisition opportunities, we consider both the strategic and financial benefits of any such acquisitions.
•   joint ventures or other strategic arrangements with partners are a key part of our strategy. we have initiatives in several markets to expedite our penetration of those markets and establish relationships with potential customers. some of these arrangements involve and are expected to involve significant investments or other allocations of capital that could reduce
62
our liquidity or require us to pursue additional sources of financing, assuming such sources are available to us. additionally, we have elected and may in the future elect or be required to temporarily retain a noncontrolling ownership interest in certain underlying systems projects we develop, supply modules to, or construct. any such retained ownership interest is expected to impact our liquidity to the extent we do not obtain new sources of capital to fund such investments.
•   during 2016, we expect to spend $300 million to $400 million for capital expenditures, including expenditures for upgrades to our existing machinery and equipment, which we believe will further increase our solar module conversion efficiencies.
•   under sales agreements for certain of our solar power projects, we may be required to repurchase such projects if certain events occur, such as not achieving commercial operation of the project within a certain time frame. although we consider the possibility that we would be required to repurchase any of our solar power projects to be remote, our current working capital and other available sources of liquidity may not be sufficient to make any required repurchase. if we are required to repurchase a solar power project, we would have the ability to market and sell such project at then current market pricing, which could be at a lower than expected price to the extent the event requiring the repurchase impacts the project's marketability. our liquidity may also be impacted as the time between the repurchase of a project and the potential sale of such repurchased project could take several months.
global sovereign debt problems and their impact on the balance sheets and lending practices of global banks, such as the disruption in the credit markets during and after the 2008 financial crisis, could negatively impact our access to and cost of capital and therefore could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and competitive position. such problems could also similarly affect our customers and therefore limit the demand for our systems projects or solar modules. as of december 31, 2015, our liquidity, marketable securities, and restricted investments have not been materially adversely impacted by the current credit environment, and we believe that they will not be materially adversely impacted in the near future. we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets. however, we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the current credit environment.

operating activities the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during 2015 was primarily driven by the increase in project assets and deferred project costs resulting from our financing the construction of certain projects with our working capital and increases in our trade accounts receivable. the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during 2014 was primarily attributable to the timing of cash received from customers for the sale of certain systems projects.
investing activities the decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2015 was driven by the receipt of $239.0 million from the initial public offering of 8point3 energy partners lp, changes in our restricted cash balance, and lower purchases of property, plant and equipment. the effects of these items were partially offset by net purchases of marketable securities of $203.1 million during 2015 compared to $77.5 million during 2014. the decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2014 was primarily due to changes in our restricted cash balance, lower proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment, and certain investments in affiliate notes receivable. the effects of these items were partially offset by net purchases of marketable securities of $77.5 million during 2014 compared to $341.0 million during 2013.
63
financing activities cash provided by financing activities during 2015 resulted primarily from $146.0 million of proceeds from borrowings under our project construction credit facilities in chile, japan, and india and $44.7 million of proceeds from the leaseback financing associated with the maryland solar project, partially offset by $47.1 million of payments on long-term debt. cash provided by financing activities during 2014 resulted primarily from $65.6 million of proceeds from borrowings under our project construction credit facilities in chile, partially offset by $60.1 million of payments on long-term debt. cash provided by financing activities during 2013 was primarily driven by proceeds from our june 2013 equity offering of $428.2 million, partially offset by net payments on our revolving credit facility of $270.0 million and $65.0 million of payments on long-term debt.
contractual obligations the following table presents our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2015 (in thousands), which consists of legal commitments requiring us to make fixed or determinable cash payments. we purchase raw materials for inventory, construction materials, various services, and manufacturing equipment from a variety of vendors. during the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing and construction lead times and help assure an adequate supply of certain items, we enter into agreements with suppliers that either allow us to procure goods and services when we choose or that establish purchase requirements over the term of the agreement.

(1)   includes estimated cash interest to be paid over the remaining terms of the underlying debt. interest payments are based on fixed and floating rates in effect at december 31, 2015 and include the effect of interest rate and cross currency swap agreements.
(2)   sale-leaseback payments represent the fixed rent payments associated with our leaseback of the maryland solar project from a subsidiary of 8point3 energy partners lp. see note 12 "investments in unconsolidated affiliates and joint ventures" to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
(3)   purchase obligations are agreements to purchase goods or services that are noncancelable, enforceable, and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions.
(4)   in connection with project acquisitions, we may agree to pay additional amounts to project sellers upon achievement of project-related milestones such as obtaining a ppa, obtaining financing, and selling to a new owner. we recognize a contingent liability when we determine that such liability is both probable and reasonably estimable. see note 16 "commitments and contingencies" to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2015 included in this annual report on form 10-k for further information about our contingent consideration.
(5)   includes expected letter of credit fees and unused revolver fees.
in addition to the amounts shown in the table above, we have recorded $141.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with accounting standards codification ("asc") 740, income taxes, and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled.
64
off-balance sheet arrangements we have no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations, other than financial assurance related instruments and operating leases, that are not classified as debt. we do not guarantee any third-party debt. see note 15 "commitments and contingencies," to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2015 included in this annual report on form 10-k for further information about our financial assurance related instruments.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 3 "recent accounting pronouncements" to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2015 included in this annual report on form 10-k for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements.
critical accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of reported assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto. some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the selection of the appropriate assumptions for making these estimates. by their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience, our forecasts, and other available information, as appropriate. our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2015 included in this annual report on form 10-k. our critical accounting estimates, which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k, are as follows:
revenue recognition - systems business. we recognize revenue for arrangements entered into by our systems business generally using two revenue recognition models, following the guidance in either asc 605-35, construction-type and production-type contracts, or asc 360-20, real estate sales, for arrangements which include land or land rights.
systems business sales arrangements in which we construct a pv solar power system for a specific customer on land that is controlled by the customer, and has not been previously controlled by first solar, are accounted for under asc 605-35. for such sales arrangements, we use the percentage-of-completion method, as described further below, using actual costs incurred over total estimated costs to develop and construct the system (including module costs) as our standard accounting policy.
systems business sales arrangements in which we convey control of land or land rights as part of the transaction are accounted for under asc 360-20. accordingly, we use one of the following revenue recognition methods, based upon an evaluation of the substance and form of the terms and conditions of such real estate sales:
(i)   we apply the percentage-of-completion method, as further described below, to certain real estate sales arrangements in which we convey control of land or land rights, when a sale has been consummated, we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer, the initial and continuing investment criteria have been met, we have the ability to estimate our costs and progress toward completion, and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. when evaluating whether the usual risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer, we consider whether we have or may be contingently required to have any prohibited forms of continuing involvement with the project pursuant to asc 360-20. the initial and continuing investment requirements, which demonstrate a buyer's commitment to honor its obligations for the sales arrangement, can typically be met through the receipt of cash or an irrevocable letter of credit from a highly creditworthy lending institution.
(ii)   depending on whether the initial and continuing investment requirements have been met and whether collectability from the buyer is reasonably assured, we may align our revenue recognition and release of project assets or deferred project costs to cost of sales with the receipt of payment from the buyer if the sale has been consummated and we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer.
for any systems business sales arrangements containing multiple deliverables (including our solar modules) not required to be accounted for under asc 605-35 (long-term construction contracts) or asc 360-20 (real estate), we analyze each activity within the sales arrangement to adhere to the separation guidelines of asc 605-25 for multiple-element arrangements. we allocate revenue for any transactions involving multiple elements to each unit of accounting based on its relative selling price and recognize revenue for each unit of accounting when all revenue recognition criteria for a unit of accounting have been met.
65
our system business sales arrangements within the scope of asc 360-20 involve a range of standard product warranties, which include limited solar module warranties, limited bos warranties, and system energy performance testing. each standard product warranty program represents a risk of the module manufacturer or system epc contractor, and is not an obligation or risk of a system owner. these programs do not represent any guarantee of energy output and relate to the underlying performance of the system assets. consequently, our product warranty programs do not represent any guarantees of cash flows related to the systems, and we have not assumed any of the risks and rewards of ownership with respect to such programs. separately, our systems customers may also engage us to provide o&m services, which would typically include an effective availability guarantee. our availability guarantees are an incremental offering within separate arrangements for o&m services. availability guarantees are guarantees of our own service performance and do not represent guarantees of a system's output or cash flows. accordingly, our product warranties and market based service contracts are not forms of continuing involvement that would indicate that substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have not been transferred to the system owner.
revenue recognition - percentage-of-completion. in applying the percentage-of-completion method, we use the actual costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs (including module costs) in order to determine the progress towards completion and calculate the corresponding amount of revenue and profit to recognize. costs incurred include direct materials, solar modules, labor, subcontractor costs, and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor and supplies. we recognize direct material and solar module costs as incurred when the direct materials and solar modules have been installed in the project. when contracts specify that title to direct materials and solar modules transfers to the customer before installation has been performed, we will not recognize revenue or the associated costs until those materials are installed and have met all other revenue recognition requirements. we consider direct materials and solar modules to be installed when they are permanently placed or affixed to a pv solar power system as required by engineering designs. solar modules manufactured and owned by us that will be used in our systems remain within inventory until such modules are installed in a system.
the percentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition requires us to make estimates of net contract revenues and costs to complete our projects. in making such estimates, management judgments are required to evaluate significant assumptions including the amount of net contract revenues, the cost of materials and labor, expected labor productivity, the impact of potential variances in schedule completion, and the impact of any penalties, claims, change orders, or performance incentives.
if estimated total costs on any contract are greater than the net contract revenues, we recognize the entire estimated loss in the period the loss becomes known. the cumulative effect of the revisions to estimates related to net contract revenues and costs to complete contracts, including penalties, claims, change orders, performance incentives, anticipated losses, and others are recorded in the period in which the revisions to estimates are identified and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. the effect of the changes on future periods are recognized as if the revised estimates had been used since revenue was initially recognized under the contract. such revisions could occur in any reporting period, and the effects may be material depending on the size of the contracts or the changes in estimates.
accrued solar module collection and recycling liability. at the time of sale, we record our collection and recycling obligation based on the estimated cost to collect and recycle the covered solar modules. we estimate the cost of our collection and recycling obligations based on the present value of the expected probability weighted future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules, which includes estimates for the cost of packaging materials, the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center, the material, labor, capital costs, and scale of recycling centers, and an estimated third-party profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services. we base these estimates on (i) our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules, (ii) the expected timing of when our solar modules will be returned for recycling, and (iii) expected economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled. in the periods between the time of sale and the related settlement of the collection and recycling obligation, we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used for its initial measurement. we periodically review our estimates of expected future recycling costs and may adjust our liability accordingly.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we completed our annual cost study of obligations under our module collection and recycling program based on newly implemented recycling technologies at our manufacturing facility in perrysburg, ohio and reduced our associated liability by $80.0 million. the new recycling technology represents a significant improvement over previous technologies and contains a continuous flow recycling process, which increases the throughput of modules able to be recycled at a point in time. such process improvements also result in corresponding reductions in capital, chemical, labor, maintenance, and other general recycling costs, which further contribute to the reduction in the recycling rate per module and corresponding change in the liability. at december 31, 2015, our estimated liability for collecting and recycling solar modules covered by our collection and recycling program was $163.4 million. a 1% increase in the annualized inflation rate used in our estimated future collection and recycling cost per module would increase our liability by $36.7 million, and a 1% decrease in that rate would decrease our liability by $30.7 million.
66
product warranties and accrued expense in excess of product warranties. we provide a limited pv solar module warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for 10 years following the transfer of title to our modules. we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreed-upon specifications will produce at least 97% of their labeled power output rating during the first year, with the warranty coverage reducing by 0.7% every year thereafter throughout the 25-year performance warranty period. prior to 2014, we warranted that modules installed in accordance with agreed-upon specifications would produce at least 90% of their labeled power output rating during the first 10 years following installation and at least 80% of their labeled power output rating during the following 15 years. in resolving claims under both the defect and power output warranties, we have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered modules or, under the power output warranty, providing additional modules to remedy the power shortfall. we also have the option to make a payment for the then current market price of modules to resolve the claims. such limited module warranties are standard for module sales and are automatically transferred from the original purchasers of the solar modules to subsequent purchasers upon resale.
as an alternative form of our standard limited module power output warranty, we also offer an aggregated or system level limited module performance warranty. this system level limited module performance warranty is designed for utility-scale systems and provides 25-year system level energy degradation protection. in addition, this warranty represents a practical expedient to address the challenge of identifying, from the potential millions of modules installed in a utility-scale system, individual modules that may be performing below warranty thresholds by focusing on the aggregate energy generated by the system rather than the power output of individual modules. the system level module performance warranty typically is calculated as a percentage of a system's expected energy production, adjusted for certain actual site conditions, with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion, but never falling below 80% during the term of the warranty. in resolving claims under the system level limited module performance warranty to restore the system to warranted performance levels, we first must validate that the root cause of the issue is due to module performance; we then have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered modules, providing supplemental modules, or making a cash payment. consistent with our limited module power output warranty, when we elect to satisfy a warranty claim by providing replacement or supplemental modules under the system level module performance warranty, we do not have any obligation to pay for the labor to remove or install modules.
in addition to our limited solar module warranty described above, for pv solar power systems built by us, we typically provide a limited product warranty on bos parts for defects in engineering design, installation, and workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system. in resolving claims under such bos warranties, we have the option of remedying the defect through repair or replacement.
when we recognize revenue for module or systems sales, we accrue liabilities for the estimated future costs of meeting our limited warranty obligations. we make and revise these estimates based primarily on the number of our solar modules under warranty installed at customer locations, our historical experience with warranty claims, our monitoring of field installation sites, our internal testing of and the expected future performance of our solar modules and bos components, and our estimated per-module replacement costs.
we may also accrue expenses for the cost of any voluntary remediation programs beyond our normal product warranty. our estimates for such remediation programs are based on an evaluation of available information including the estimated number of potentially affected solar modules, historical experience related to our remediation efforts, customer-provided data related to potentially affected systems, estimated costs for performing removal, replacement, and logistical services, and any post-sale expenses covered under our voluntary remediation program. if any of our estimates prove incorrect, we could be required to accrue additional expenses.
at december 31, 2015, our accrued liabilities for product warranties and accrued expense in excess of product warranties were $231.8 million and $24.6 million, respectively. we have historically estimated our product warranty liability for power output and defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions to have an estimated warranty return rate of approximately 3% of modules covered under warranty. a 1% change in the estimated warranty return rate would change our estimated product warranty liability by $71.5 million, and a 1% change in the estimated warranty return rate for bos components would not have a material impact on the associated warranty liability.
67
performance guarantees. for systems sales arrangements, we also conduct performance testing of a system prior to substantial completion to confirm the system meets its operational and capacity expectations noted in the epc agreement. in addition, we may provide an energy performance test during the first year of a system's operation to demonstrate that the actual energy generation for the first year meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation, after certain adjustments. these tests are based on meteorological, energy, and equipment performance data measured at the system's location as well as certain projections of such data over the remaining measurement period. if there is an underperformance event with regards to these tests, we may incur liquidated damages as a percentage of the epc contract price. if necessary, we accrue estimates for liquidated damages at the end of each reporting period based on our performance testing. in certain instances, a bonus payment may be received at the end of the first year if the system performs above a specified level.
as part of our o&m service offerings, we typically offer an effective availability guarantee, which stipulates that a system will be available to generate a certain percentage of total possible energy during a specific period after adjusting for factors outside of our control as the service provider, such as weather, curtailment, outages, force majeure, and other conditions that may affect system availability. effective availability guarantees are only offered as part of our o&m services and terminate at the end of an o&m arrangement. these guarantees are based on meteorological, energy, and equipment performance data measured at the system's location as well as certain projections of such data over the remaining measurement period. if we fail to meet the contractual threshold for these guarantees, we may incur liquidated damages for certain lost energy under the ppa. if necessary, we accrue estimates for liquidated damages at the end of each reporting period based on our effective availability calculations. conversely, many of our o&m agreements contain provisions whereby we may receive a bonus payment if system availability exceeds a separate threshold.
accounting for income taxes. we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states, and its states and municipalities, and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. we regularly evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and future examinations, and we record tax liabilities as appropriate.
we establish liabilities for potential additional taxes based on our assessment of the outcome of our tax positions. once established, we adjust the liabilities when additional information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment. significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of a tax assessment, fine, or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities, if any.
in preparing our consolidated financial statements, we calculate our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the tax laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. this requires us to estimate our current tax obligations, assess uncertain tax positions, and assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
we must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized. to the extent we believe that realization of any of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance. when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period, we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations. conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, which generally reduces our overall income tax expense.
we also consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and determine whether such amounts are indefinitely reinvested. accordingly, no additional u.s. or non-u.s. taxes have been accrued that may be incurred if such amounts were repatriated to the united states. we have concluded that, except for the earnings of our canadian subsidiary and with respect to previously taxed income, all such accumulated earnings are currently indefinitely reinvested or that if upon repatriation no additional u.s. or non-u.s. tax would be due. if our intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries changes, additional u.s. and non-u.s. taxes may be required to be accrued. see note 20 "income taxes" to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2015 included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
68
we continually explore initiatives to better align our tax and legal entity structure with the footprint of our non-u.s. operations and recognize the tax impact of these initiatives, including changes in the assessment of uncertain tax positions, indefinite reinvestment exception assertions, and the realizability of deferred tax assets, in the period when we believe all necessary internal and external approvals associated with such initiatives have been obtained, or when the initiatives are materially complete. it is possible that the completion of one or more of these initiatives may occur within the next 12 months.
long-lived asset impairment. we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets including property, plant and equipment, pv solar power systems, and project assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified. we review our long-lived assets each reporting period to assess whether impairment indicators are present, and we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event indicating potential impairment has occurred. for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, a long-lived asset is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities, and we must exercise judgment in assessing such groupings and levels.
for long-lived assets, when impairment indicators are present, we compare undiscounted future cash flows, including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value, to the asset group's carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable. this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used. assessments also consider changes in asset group utilization, including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing of placing the capacity back into production.
for an asset group that fails the test of recoverability described above, the estimated fair value of long-lived assets may be determined using an income approach, market approach, cost approach, or a combination of one or more of these approaches as appropriate for the particular asset group being reviewed. all of these approaches start with the forecast of expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of the long-lived assets. we also utilize third-party valuations and information available regarding the current market for similar assets. if there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the asset group's fair value and carrying value prior to impairment. this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows, relevant discount rates, and residual values applied in the income approach used in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used.
goodwill. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value assigned to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. we do not amortize goodwill, but instead are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually. we perform impairment tests between scheduled annual tests in the fourth quarter if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value.
we may first make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. the qualitative impairment test considers various factors including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, the overall financial performance of a reporting unit, and any other relevant events affecting the entity or its reporting units. if we determine through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit's fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value, the two-step impairment test is not required. if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, we must perform the two-step impairment test. we may also elect to proceed directly to the two-step impairment test without considering such qualitative factors.
the first step in a two-step impairment test is the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. our reporting units consist of our fully integrated systems business, cdte module manufacturing business, and our crystalline silicon module manufacturing business from our tetrasun acquisition in 2013. in accordance with the authoritative guidance over fair value measurements, we define the fair value of a reporting unit as the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation, which includes the discounted cash flow method, to estimate the fair values of our reporting units.
significant management judgment is required when estimating the fair value of our reporting units including the forecasting of future operating results and the selection of discount and expected future growth rates that we use in determining the projected cash flows. if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and no further analysis is required.
69
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value in the first step, then we are required to perform the second step of the impairment test. in this step, we assign the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, as if a market participant just acquired the reporting unit in a business combination. the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in the first step of the impairment test over the total amount assigned to the assets and liabilities in the second step of the impairment test represents the implied fair value of goodwill. if the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. if there is no such excess, then all goodwill for a reporting unit is considered impaired.

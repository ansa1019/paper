item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. the following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in item 1a. risk factors. our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. see "special note regarding forward-looking statements" and item 1a. risk factors.
we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications tower structures, rooftops and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications, which we collectively refer to as "towers" or "sites." our principal operations are in the united states and its territories. in addition, we own and operate towers in south america, central america, and canada. our primary business line is our site leasing business, which contributed 96.8% of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31, 2015. in our site leasing business, we (1) lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers that we own or operate and (2) manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. as of december 31, 2015, we owned 25,465 towers, a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who, like us, have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers. we also managed or leased approximately 5,500 actual or potential towers, approximately 500 of which were revenue producing as of december 31, 2015. our other business line is our site development business, through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks.
site leasing services our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multi-tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under long-term lease contracts in the united states, canada, central america, and south america. site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants, including at&t, sprint, t-mobile, verizon wireless, oi s.a., telefonica, claro, and digicel. wireless service providers enter into tenant leases with us, each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual site. in the united states and canada, our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five to ten years with five 5-year renewal periods at the option of the tenant. these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators, which average 3-4% per year, including the renewal option periods. tenant leases in our central american and south american markets typically have an initial term of ten years with multiple five year renewal periods. in central america, we have similar rent escalators to that of leases in the united states and canada while our leases in south america escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index.
22
in our central american markets and ecuador, significantly all of our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures arising from our new build activities are denominated in u.s. dollars. specifically, most of our ground leases, tenant leases, and tower-related expenses are due and paid in u.s. dollars. in our central american markets, our local currency obligations are principally limited to (1) permitting and other local fees, (2) utilities, and (3) taxes. in our canadian and brazilian operations, significantly all of our revenue, expenses and capital expenditures, including tenant leases, ground leases and other tower-related expenses, are denominated in local currency.
cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of:
•rental payments on ground leases and other underlying property interests;
•straight-line rent adjustment for the difference between rental payments made and the expense recorded as if the payments had been made evenly throughout the lease term (which may include renewal terms) of the underlying property interests;
•property taxes;
•site maintenance and monitoring costs (exclusive of employee related costs);
•utilities;
•property insurance; and
•deferred lease origination cost amortization.
ground leases are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal terms of five year periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 2-3% annually, or in our south american markets, adjust in accordance with a standard cost of living index. as of december 31, 2015, approximately 73% of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own, land subject to perpetual easements, or parcels of land in which we have a leasehold interest that extends beyond 20 years. for any given tower, costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period. as such, operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase as a result of adding additional customers to the tower. the amount of direct costs associated with operating a tower varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower. the ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems, painting a tower, or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing.
as indicated in the table below, our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit. for information regarding our operating segments, see note 18 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.

we believe that over the long-term, site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use and data transfer, network expansion and network coverage requirements. during 2016, we expect organic site leasing revenue in both our domestic and international segments to be consistent with our growth in 2015. we believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and long-term recurring revenues, predictable operating costs and minimal non-discretionary capital expenditures. due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio, we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal. consequently, we expect to grow our cash flows by (1) adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications and (2) executing monetary amendments as wireless service providers add or upgrade their equipment. furthermore, because our towers are strategically positioned and our customers typically do not relocate, we have historically experienced low tenant lease terminations as a percentage of revenue other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessations of service (e.g. iden).

site development services our site development business, which is conducted in the united states only, is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities, such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations. site development services revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers. our services include: (1) network pre-design; (2) site audits; (3) identification of potential locations for towers and antennas; (4) support in buying or leasing of the location; (5) assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits; (6) tower and related site construction; (7) antenna installation; and (8) radio equipment installation, commissioning, and maintenance. we provide site development services on a local basis, through regional, territory, and project offices. the regional offices are responsible for all site development operations, including hiring employees and opening or closing project offices, and a substantial portion of the sales in such area.
for information regarding our operating segments, see note 18 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list. in many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, with no need for management's judgment in their application. in other cases, management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions. the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2015, included herein. our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant.  revenue recognition and accounts receivable revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly and recognized on a straight-line basis over the current term of the related lease agreements, which are generally five to ten years. receivables recorded related to the straight-lining of site leases are reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. rental amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets.
site development projects in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis. time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates and revenue is recognized as the services are rendered. for those site development contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis, site development billing (and revenue recognition) is based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis. upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis, we recognize the revenue related to that phase. site development projects generally take from 3 to 12 months to complete. amounts billed in advance (collected or uncollected) are recorded as deferred revenue on the company's consolidated balance sheets.
revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management's estimated total cost for each contract. this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts. these amounts are based on estimates, and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion. the asset "costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts" represents costs incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. the liability "billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts," included within other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, represents billings in excess of costs incurred and revenues recognized. provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable.
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers. we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience, specific customer collection issues identified, and
24
past due balances as determined based on contractual terms. interest is charged on outstanding receivables from customers on a case by case basis in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts or agreements with those customers. amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which uncollectibility is determined to be probable.
asset impairment we evaluate individual long-lived and related assets with finite lives for indicators of impairment to determine when an impairment analysis should be performed. we evaluate our tower assets and current contract intangibles at the tower level, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exists. we evaluate our network location intangibles for impairment at the tower leasing business level whenever indicators of impairment are present. we have established a policy to at least annually evaluate our tower assets and current contract intangibles for impairment.
we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers or related assets has been impaired, such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower and related intangible. if the future undiscounted cash flows are lower than the carrying value of the investment in the tower and related intangible, we calculate future discounted cash flows and compare those amounts to the carrying value. we record an impairment charge for any amounts lower than the carrying value. estimates and assumptions inherent in the impairment evaluation include, but are not limited to, general market and economic conditions, historical operating results, geographic location, lease-up potential, and expected timing of lease-up. in addition, we make certain assumptions in determining an asset's fair value for the purpose of calculating the amount of an impairment charge.
business combinations we account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. the assets and liabilities we acquire are recorded at fair market value at the date of each acquisition and the results of operations of the acquired assets are included with our results of operations from the dates of the respective acquisitions. we continue to evaluate all acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable closing date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of information available at the acquisition date. the intangible assets represent the value associated with the current leases at the acquisition date ("current contract intangibles") and future tenant leases anticipated to be added to the communication sites ("network location intangibles") and were calculated using the discounted values of the current or future expected cash flows. the intangible assets are estimated to have a useful life consistent with the useful life of the related communication site assets, which is typically 15 years.
in connection with certain acquisitions, we may agree to pay contingent consideration (or earnouts) in cash or stock if the communication sites or businesses that are acquired meet or exceed certain performance targets over a period of one to three years after they have been acquired. we accrue for contingent consideration in connection with acquisitions at fair value as of the date of the acquisition. all subsequent changes in fair value of contingent consideration are recorded through consolidated statements of operations.

interest expense increased $43.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the higher average principal amount of cash-interest bearing debt outstanding for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year, primarily resulting from the issuance of the 2013 and 2014 tower securities, 2014 term loan, and 4.875% notes, partially offset by the maturity of the 1.875% notes and 4.0% notes and full repayment of the 2011 term loan, 2012-2 term loan, 2010-1 tower securities, and 8.25% notes.
non-cash interest expense decreased $22.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the prior year. this decrease primarily reflects the full repayment of the 1.875% notes in may of 2013 and 4.0% notes in october of 2014.
amortization of deferred financing fees increased $2.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared to the prior year, primarily resulting from the issuance of the 2013 and 2014 tower securities, 2014 term loan, and 4.875% notes, partially offset by the full repayment of the 2011 term loan, 2012-2 term loan, 8.25% notes, and 2010-1 tower securities, and the maturity of the 1.875% and 4.0% notes.
loss from extinguishment of debt increased $20.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the premium paid and write-off of the debt discount and deferred financing fees associated with the full redemption of the 8.25% notes, the write-off of a portion of the related debt discount and deferred financing fees associated with the repayment of the 2011 term loan, 2012-2 term loan, and 2010-1 tower securities, and the early settlement of a portion of the 4.0% notes.    other income decreased $20.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a gain of $27.3 million recognized in the prior year related to the sale of a bankruptcy claim. the current year reflects a $17.9 million gain realized on the settlement of two foreign currency contracts which were entered into and settled during the first quarter of 2014 in order to hedge the purchase price of the oi s.a. acquisition in brazil which closed march 31, 2014 and a $12.5 million gain on the sale of a cost-method investment during the fourth quarter of 2014. these gains were partially offset by a $23.0 million loss related to the remeasurement of a foreign denominated intercompany loan.

net loss was $24.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, a decrease of $31.6 million compared to a loss of $55.9 million in the prior year. the decrease in net loss is primarily due to an increase in our total segment operating profit and a decrease in non-cash interest expense as compared to the prior year, offset by increases in selling, general, and administrative expenses, loss from extinguishment of debt, depreciation, amortization, and accretion, and interest expense, as well as, a decrease in other income as compared to the prior year.

non-gaap financial measures this report contains information regarding a non-gaap measure, adjusted ebitda. we have provided below a description of adjusted ebitda, a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to its most directly comparable gaap measure and an explanation as to why management utilizes this measure.
adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as net loss excluding the impact of non-cash straight-line leasing revenue, non-cash straight-line ground lease expense, non-cash compensation, net loss from extinguishment of debt, other income and expenses, acquisition related adjustments and expenses, asset impairment and decommission costs, interest income, interest expenses, depreciation, accretion, and amortization, and provision for or benefit from taxes.
we believe that adjusted ebitda is an indicator of the financial performance of our core businesses. adjusted ebitda is a component of the calculation that has been used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our senior credit agreement and the indentures relating to our 5.625% notes, 5.75% notes, and 4.875% notes. adjusted ebitda is not intended to be an alternative measure of operating income or gross profit margin as determined in accordance with gaap.

financing activities on february 5, 2015, we entered into an amendment to our revolving credit facility to (1) increase the size of the facility by $230.0 million to $1.0 billion, (2) extend the maturity date to february 5, 2020, and (3) lower the applicable interest rate margins and commitment fees depending on borrower leverage (as defined in the senior credit agreement).
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we borrowed $770.0 million and repaid $895.0 million under the revolving credit facility, resulting in no outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility at year-end. as of december 31, 2015, the remaining borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility was $1.0 billion, subject to compliance with specified financial ratios and satisfaction of other customary conditions to borrowing.    on june 10, 2015, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, sba senior finance ii llc, obtained a new senior secured term loan with an aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million that was issued at 99.0% of par value and matures on june 10, 2022 (the "2015 term loan"). net proceeds from the 2015 term loan were used to repay $490.0 million of the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility.
on october 14, 2015, we, through our existing sba tower trust, issued $500.0 million of 3.156% secured tower revenue securities series 2015-1c which have an anticipated repayment date of october 8, 2020 and a final maturity date of october 10, 2045 (the "2015 tower securities"). net proceeds from this offering were used to make a cash distribution to sba guarantor llc which was further distributed (1) to repay outstanding amounts on the revolving credit facility and (2) for general corporate purposes.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we repaid the entire $172.5 million outstanding principal balance on the 2012-1 term loan. in connection with the prepayment, we expensed $0.8 million of net deferred financing fees.
during the year ended december, 31 2015, we settled the remaining outstanding warrants originally sold in connection with the 4.0% notes. the warrants represented approximately 2.1 million underlying shares of class a common stock, and we satisfied our obligations by paying $150.9 million in cash.    during the second quarter of 2015, we repurchased the remaining $150.0 million of our class a common stock authorized under our $300.0 million stock repurchase plan, completing this plan.
on june 4, 2015, we announced the authorization of a new $1.0 billion stock repurchase plan. this new plan authorizes us to purchase from time to time our outstanding common stock through open market repurchases in compliance with rule 10b-18 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, and/or in privately negotiated transactions at management's discretion. shares purchased will be retired. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of our class a common stock under our stock repurchase program for $300.1 million at a weighted average price per share of $112.04. as of december 31, 2015, we had a remaining authorization to repurchase $700.0 million of class a common stock under our current $1.0 billion stock repurchase program.
subsequent to december 31, 2015, we repurchased 0.5 million shares of our class a common stock under our stock repurchase program for $50.0 million at a weighted average price per share of $98.65. as of the date of this filing, we had a remaining authorization to repurchase $650.0 million of class a common stock under our current $1.0 billion stock repurchase program.
registration statements we have on file with the commission a shelf registration statement on form s-4 registering shares of class a common stock that we may issue in connection with the acquisition of wireless communication towers or antenna sites and related assets or companies who own wireless communication towers, antenna sites, or related assets. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we did not issue any shares of class a common stock under this registration statement. as of december 31, 2015, we had approximately 1.7 million shares of class a common stock remaining under this shelf registration statement.
36
on march 3, 2015, we filed with the commission an automatic shelf registration statement for well-known seasoned issuers on form s-3asr. this registration statement enables us to issue shares of our class a common stock, preferred stock or debt securities either separately or represented by warrants, or depositary shares as well as units that include any of these securities. under the rules governing automatic shelf registration statements, we will file a prospectus supplement and advise the commission of the amount and type of securities each time we issue securities under this registration statement. no shares were issued under this registration statement through the date of this filing.
debt instruments and debt service requirements senior credit agreement on february 7, 2014, sba senior finance ii entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement with several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties to the second amended and restated credit agreement to, among other things, incur the 2014 term loan and amend certain terms of the existing senior credit agreement (as amended, the "senior credit agreement").   terms of the senior credit agreement the senior credit agreement, as amended, requires sba senior finance ii to maintain specific financial ratios, including (1) a ratio of consolidated total debt to annualized borrower ebitda not to exceed 6.5 times for any fiscal quarter, (2) a ratio of consolidated total debt and net hedge exposure (calculated in accordance with the senior credit agreement) to annualized borrower ebitda for the most recently ended fiscal quarter not to exceed 6.5 times for 30 consecutive days and (3) a ratio of annualized borrower ebitda to annualized cash interest expense (calculated in accordance with the senior credit agreement) of not less than 2.0 times for any fiscal quarter. the senior credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of sba senior finance ii and its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, grant certain liens, make certain investments, enter into sale leaseback transactions, merge or consolidate, make certain restricted payments, enter into transactions with affiliates, and engage in certain asset dispositions, including a sale of all or substantially all of their property. as of december 31, 2015, sba senior finance ii was in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the senior credit agreement. the senior credit agreement is also subject to customary events of default. pursuant to the second amended and restated guarantee and collateral agreement, amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility, the term loans and certain hedging transactions that may be entered into by sba senior finance ii or the subsidiary guarantors (as defined in the senior credit agreement) with lenders or their affiliates are secured by a first lien on the membership interests of sba telecommunications, llc, sba senior finance, llc and sba senior finance ii and on substantially all of the assets (other than leasehold, easement and fee interests in real property) of sba senior finance ii and the subsidiary guarantors.
the senior credit agreement, as amended, permits sba senior finance ii, without the consent of the other lenders, to request that one or more lenders provide sba senior finance ii with increases in the revolving credit facility or additional term loans provided that after giving effect to the proposed increase in revolving credit facility commitments or incremental term loans the ratio of consolidated total debt to annualized borrower ebitda would not exceed 6.5 times. sba senior finance ii's ability to request such increases in the revolving credit facility or additional term loans is subject to its compliance with customary conditions set forth in the senior credit agreement including compliance, on a pro forma basis, with the financial covenants and ratios set forth therein and, with respect to any additional term loan, an increase in the margin on existing term loans to the extent required by the terms of the senior credit agreement. upon sba senior finance ii's request, each lender may decide, in its sole discretion, whether to increase all or a portion of its revolving credit facility commitment or whether to provide sba senior finance ii with additional term loans and, if so, upon what terms.
revolving credit facility under the senior credit agreement on february 5, 2015, sba senior finance ii entered into the 2015 revolving refinancing amendment with several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties to the senior credit agreement to, among other things, (i) increase the borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility from $770.0 million to $1.0 billion, (ii) extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to february 5, 2020, (iii) provide for the ability to borrow in u.s. dollars and certain designated foreign currencies, and (iv) lower the applicable interest rate margins and commitment fees under the revolving credit facility.
as amended february 2015, the revolving credit facility consists of a revolving loan under which up to $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount may be borrowed, repaid and redrawn, subject to compliance with specific financial ratios and the satisfaction of other customary conditions to borrowing. amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility accrue interest, at sba senior finance ii's election, at either (i) the eurodollar rate plus a margin that ranges from 137.5 basis points to 200.0 basis points or (ii) the
37

secured tower revenue securities tower revenue securities terms the mortgage loan underlying the 2010 tower securities, 2012 tower securities, 2013 tower securities, 2014 tower securities, and 2015 tower securities (together the "tower securities") will be paid from the operating cash flows from the aggregate 10,585 tower sites owned by the borrowers. the mortgage loan is secured by (i) mortgages, deeds of trust, and deeds to secure debt on a substantial portion of the tower sites, (ii) a security interest in the tower sites and substantially all of the borrowers' personal property and fixtures, (iii) the borrowers' rights under certain tenant leases, and (iv) all of the proceeds of the foregoing. for each calendar month, sba network management, inc., an indirect subsidiary ("network management"), is entitled to receive a management fee equal to 4.5% of the borrowers' operating revenues for the immediately preceding calendar month.
the borrowers may prepay any of the mortgage loan components, in whole or in part, with no prepayment consideration, (i) within nine months (in the case of the components corresponding to the 2010 tower securities), twelve months (in the case of the component corresponding to the 2012 tower securities, secured tower revenue securities series 2013-1c, secured tower revenue securities series 2013-1d, secured tower revenue securities series 2014-1c, and secured tower revenue securities series 2015-1c), or eighteen months (in the case of the components corresponding to the secured tower revenue securities series 2013-2c and secured tower revenue securities series 2014-2c) of the anticipated repayment date of such mortgage loan component, (ii) with proceeds received as a result of any condemnation or casualty of any tower owned by the borrowers or (iii) during an amortization period. in all other circumstances, the borrowers may prepay the mortgage loan, in whole or in part, upon payment of the applicable prepayment consideration. the prepayment consideration is determined based on the class of the tower securities to which the prepaid mortgage loan component corresponds and consists of an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1) the present value associated with the portion of the principal balance being prepaid, calculated in accordance with the formula set forth in the mortgage loan agreement, on the date of prepayment of all future installments of principal and interest required to be paid from the date of prepayment to and including the first due date within nine months (in the case of the components corresponding to the 2010 tower securities), twelve months (in the case of the component corresponding to the 2012 tower securities, secured tower revenue securities series 2013-1c, secured tower revenue securities series 2013-1d, secured tower revenue securities series 2014-1c, and secured tower revenue securities series 2015-1c), or eighteen months (in the case of the components corresponding to the secured tower revenue securities series 2013-2c and secured tower revenue securities series 2014-2c) of the anticipated repayment date of such mortgage loan component over (2) that portion of the principal balance of such class prepaid on the date of such prepayment.
to the extent that the mortgage loan components corresponding to the tower securities are not fully repaid by their respective anticipated repayment dates, the interest rate of each such component will increase by the greater of (i) 5% and (ii) the amount, if any, by which the sum of (x) the ten-year u.s. treasury rate plus (y) the credit-based spread for such component (as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement) plus (z) 5%, exceeds the original interest rate for such component.
pursuant to the terms of the tower securities, all rents and other sums due on any of the towers owned by the borrowers are directly deposited by the lessees into a controlled deposit account and are held by the indenture trustee. the monies held by the indenture trustee after the release date are classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets (see note 4). however, if the debt service coverage ratio, defined as the net cash flow (as defined in the mortgage loan agreement) divided by the amount of interest on the mortgage loan, servicing fees and trustee fees that the borrowers are required to pay over the succeeding twelve months, as of the end of any calendar quarter, falls to 1.30x or lower, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents, referred to as "excess cash flow," will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the borrowers. the funds in the reserve account will not be released to the borrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.30x for two consecutive calendar quarters. if the debt service coverage ratio falls below 1.15x as of the end of any calendar quarter, then an "amortization period" will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.15x for a calendar quarter. in addition, if any of the tower securities are not fully repaid by their respective anticipated repayment dates, the cash flow from the towers owned by the borrowers will be trapped by the trustee for the tower securities and applied first to repay the interest, at the original interest rates, on the mortgage loan components underlying the tower securities, second to fund all reserve accounts and operating expenses associated with those towers, third to pay the management fees due to network management, fourth to repay principal of the tower securities and fifth to repay the additional interest discussed above. the mortgage loan agreement, as amended, also includes covenants customary for mortgage loans subject to rated securitizations. among other things, the borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. as of december 31, 2015, the borrowers met the required debt service coverage ratio as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement and were in compliance with all other covenants.

inflation the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date. however, we cannot assure you that a high rate of inflation in the future will not adversely affect our operating results particularly in light of the fact that our site leasing revenues are governed by long-term contracts with pre-determined pricing that we will not be able to increase in response to increases in inflation other than our contracts in brazil which have inflationary index based rental escalators.

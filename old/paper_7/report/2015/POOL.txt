item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of our base business calculations, see the results of operations section below.
2015 financial overview financial results we had a record-setting year in 2015 topped off with favorable warmer weather in the fourth quarter, which contributed to record fourth quarter sales and our first profitable fourth quarter ever. we grew annual sales by 5% over 2014, despite an almost 2% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. strict margin discipline and expense management enabled us to expand our operating margin by more than 70 basis points.
net sales for the year ended december 31, 2015 increased 5% compared to 2014. base business sales also increased 5%. annual sales benefited from increased consumer spending on discretionary products, particularly related to replacement and remodel activity. pool owners are investing to upgrade existing pools and outdoor systems to increase energy efficiency and incorporate more technologically advanced products. record warm temperatures through much of the fourth quarter extended the pool season well into november and december in many markets, which spurred greater sales in both our building materials and equipment product categories.
gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2015 increased 5% over 2014. gross profit as a percentage of net sales (gross margin) remained constant at 28.6% for both 2015 and 2014.
selling and administrative expenses (operating expenses) for 2015 increased just 1% from 2014. increases in performance-based incentive compensation and technology related expenses were offset by tight expense controls and an approximate 2% favorable impact on operating expenses from the stronger u.s. dollar relative to foreign currencies.
operating income for the year improved 14% over 2014. operating income as a percentage of net sales (operating margin) increased to 9.1% in 2015 compared to 8.4% in 2014.
net income attributable to pool corporation increased 16% compared to 2014, while earnings per share was up 19% to a record $2.90 per diluted share.
financial position and liquidity cash provided by operations was $146.1 million in 2015 and exceeded total net income by $17.8 million. combined with $8.9 million in net proceeds from borrowings, cash from operating activities helped fund the following initiatives:
•   share repurchases in the open market of $92.4 million;
•   quarterly cash dividend payments to shareholders, totaling $43.1 million for the year;
•   net capital expenditures of $29.1 million; and
•   payments of $4.5 million for acquisitions.
total net receivables, including pledged receivables, increased 11% compared to december 31, 2014, indicating our december 2015 sales growth. our allowance for doubtful accounts increased 5% compared to december 31, 2014. overall we noted lower write-offs as a percentage of net sales throughout 2015 and a smaller percentage of total receivables being greater than 60 days past due.
inventory levels grew 2% to $474.3 million at december 31, 2015 compared to $467.0 million at december 31, 2014. our reserve for inventory obsolescence was $7.0 million at december 31, 2015 compared to $6.4 million at december 31, 2014. our inventory turns, as calculated on a trailing twelve month basis, were 3.5 times at december 31, 2015 and 3.4 times at december 31, 2014.
total debt outstanding of $329.7 million at december 31, 2015 increased $8.9 million or 3% compared to december 31, 2014.

current trends and outlook over the past five years, the pool industry has continued to show signs of recovery, mostly due to the gradual improvement in remodeling and replacement activity. the rebound in our base business sales growth since 2010 reflects increased consumer discretionary spending and higher replacement activities. improvements in general external market factors in the united states including consumer confidence, employment, housing, consumer financing and economic expansion, largely supports our base business growth. we feel these positive external trends have promoted increased consumer spending on products that enhance swimming pools and outdoor living spaces, such as building materials and energy-efficient equipment.
the economic downturn between 2007 and 2009 had a significant impact on our industry, driving an approximate 80% reduction in new pool construction in the united states compared to peak levels in 2005 and also contributing to more than a 30% decline in replacement and refurbishment activities. while we estimate that new pool construction has increased from a low of roughly 45,000 new units in 2009 to approximately 65,000 new units in 2015, construction levels are still down approximately 70% compared to peak levels in 2005 and down approximately 60% from what we consider normal levels. for each year from 2010 to 2015, we estimate the industry grew from 3% to 4%, with the exception of 2013, when we believe industry growth dipped temporarily to approximately 1% to 2% due to the impact of adverse weather on seasonal markets. while unseasonably cool temperatures impacted the industry in 2014, the impact was not quite as widespread, nor as severe. in 2015 excessive precipitation impacted our industry in the second quarter; however a mild fall and delayed winter alleviated any contraction in industry growth rates. the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against most major currencies also impacted reported results of our industry's international locations over the past 18 months.
going forward, we believe there is potential for a significant sales recovery due to the build-up of deferred replacement and remodeling activity and our expectation for new pool and irrigation construction levels to gradually normalize. additionally, we believe favorable demographics from an aging population and southern migration are ideal for increased residential investment, especially in outdoor lifestyle products. we expect that market conditions in the united states will continue to improve, enabling further recovery of replacement, remodeling and new construction activity to normalized levels over the next 4 to 7 years. we expect that the industry will realize an annual growth rate of approximately 3% to 6% over this time period. as economic trends indicate that consumer spending has been slowly recovering and that residential construction activities will likely continue to gradually improve, we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of both the eventual market recovery and the inherent long-term growth opportunities in our industry.
for 2016, we expect the macroeconomic environment in the united states and the opportunities available to us to grow market share will be quite similar to 2015. we plan to gain market share through our comprehensive product offerings, which we continually diversify through both internal sourcing initiatives and by transferring experience for other markets served. we also plan to modestly expand our geographic presence by opening 5 to 7 new sales centers in 2016 and by making selective acquisitions when appropriate opportunities arise. declining crude oil prices may impact discretionary spending in texas and certain other markets given the importance of the oil and gas industry on employment in these markets. however gains from economic stability in our other year-round markets and in our seasonal markets should mitigate the risk of these possible declines, assuming normal weather patterns. translation of our foreign earnings may also adversely impact our 2016 results, but we expect the foreign currency rate declines to be less significant than what occurred in 2015.
the following section summarizes our outlook for 2016:
•   we expect base business sales growth of 5% to 7%, consisting of the following:
◦   an increase in customer early buy shipments, mostly benefiting the first quarter of 2016 (close to 4% impact on base business sales growth) and effectively shifting some sales that would normally occur in the second quarter into the first quarter;
◦   neutral selling days for the full year for 2016 compared to 2015; however a shift in certain quarters, with one less selling day in the first quarter of 2016 and one additional selling day in the fourth quarter of 2016;
◦   inflationary product cost increases of approximately 1%; and
◦   should the u.s. dollar continue to strengthen against most major currencies, an adverse foreign currency translation impact on our sales, particularly in the second and third quarters based on our seasonal fluctuations.
•   we expect relatively neutral gross margin trends for the full year, as we believe our sales growth will continue to be weighted toward sales of lower margin discretionary products. adverse margin impacts should be offset by benefits from our efforts in various pricing, sourcing, and private-label initiatives. we expect lower margins in the first quarter and higher margins in the second quarter due to the impact of increased customer early buy shipments.
20
•   we project operating expenses will grow at approximately half the rate of our gross profit growth, reflecting inflationary increases and incremental costs to support our sales growth expectations. should the u.s. dollar continue to strengthen against most major currencies, currency translation would positively impact our operating expenses. we expect base business results will generate operating profit growth in the low- to mid-teens.
•   we expect our effective tax rate will be consistent with 2015. our effective tax rate is dependent upon our results of operations and may change if actual results are different from our current expectations, particularly any significant changes in our geographic mix.
based on the factors described above, we project that 2016 earnings will range from $3.20 to $3.35 per diluted share. we expect cash provided by operations will approximate net income for fiscal 2016 and anticipate that we will use $100.0 million to $150.0 million in cash for share repurchases.
the forward-looking statements in this current trends and outlook section are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including changes in the economy and the housing market, the sensitivity of our business to weather conditions, our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers and manufacturers, competition from other leisure product alternatives and mass merchants, and other risks detailed in item 1a of this form 10-k.
21
critical accounting estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. management identifies critical accounting estimates as:
•   those that require the use of assumptions about matters that are inherently and highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made; and
•   those for which changes in the estimate or assumptions, or the use of different estimates and assumptions, could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board. we believe the following critical accounting estimates require us to make the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments.
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on an estimate of the losses we will incur if our customers do not make required payments. we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral. consistent with industry practices, we generally require payment from our north american customers within 30 days, except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers. the extended terms usually require payments in equal installments in april, may and june or may and june, depending on geographic location. credit losses have generally been within or better than our expectations.
similar to our business, our customers' businesses are seasonal. sales are lowest in the winter months and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time. we provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on our accounts receivable aging. these reserves range from 0.05% for amounts currently due to up to 100% for specific accounts more than 60 days past due.
at the end of each quarter, we perform a reserve analysis of all accounts with balances greater than $20,000 and more than 60 days past due. additionally, we perform a separate reserve analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on past due accounts. as we review these past due accounts, we evaluate collectibility based on a combination of factors including:
•   aging statistics and trends;
•   customer payment history;
•   independent credit reports; and
•   discussions with customers.
during the year, we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote. these write-offs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts. in the past five years, write-offs have averaged approximately 0.10% of net sales annually.  write-offs as a percentage of net sales approximated 0.05% in 2015, 0.10% in 2014 and 0.10% in 2013. we expect that write-offs will approximate 0.10% of net sales in 2016.
at the end of each fiscal year, we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing the prior year-end allowance for doubtful accounts balance to (i) current year write-offs and (ii) any significantly aged outstanding receivable balances. we concluded that the prior year allowance was within a range of acceptable estimates, but conservative overall based on lower write-offs in 2015 and improvements in our accounts receivable aging. while we slightly lowered our general reserve percentage in 2015 to account for these trends, our overall reserve methodology and process for estimating specific reserves remains unchanged.
if the balance of the accounts receivable reserve increased or decreased by 20% at december 31, 2015, pretax income would change by approximately $0.8 million and earnings per share would change by approximately $0.01 per diluted share (based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31, 2015).
22
inventory obsolescence product inventories represent the largest asset on our balance sheet. our goal is to manage our inventory such that we minimize stock-outs to provide the highest level of service to our customers. to do this, we maintain at each sales center an adequate inventory of stock keeping units (skus) with the highest sales volumes. at the same time, we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory, which are not as critical to our customers and thus, inherently have lower velocity. we classify products into 13 classes at the sales center level based on sales at each location over the past 12 months (or 36 months for tile and parts products). all inventory is included in these classes, except for special order non-stock items that lack a sku in our system and products with less than 12 months of usage. the table below presents a description of these inventory classes:
class 0        new products with less than 12 months usage (or 36 months for tile and parts products)
classes 1-4    highest sales value items, which represent approximately 80% of net sales at the sales center classes 5-12   lower sales value items, which we keep in stock to provide a high level of customer service class 13       products with no sales for the past 12 months at the local sales center level, excluding special order products not yet delivered to the customer null class     non-stock special order items there is little risk of obsolescence for products in classes 1-4 because products in these classes generally turn quickly. we establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence based on inventory classes 5-13, which we believe represent some exposure to inventory obsolescence, with particular emphasis on skus with the least sales over the previous 12 months. the reserve is intended to reflect the value of inventory that we may not be able to sell at a profit. we provide a reserve of 5% for inventory in classes 5-13 and non-stock inventory as determined at the sales center level. we also provide an additional 5% reserve for excess inventory in classes 5-12 and an additional 45% reserve for excess inventory in class 13. we determine excess inventory, which is defined as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the previous 12 months' usage, on a company-wide basis.  we also evaluate whether the calculated reserve provides sufficient coverage of the total class 13 inventory.
in evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence, we consider a combination of factors including:
•   the level of inventory in relation to historical sales by product, including inventory usage by class based on product sales at both the sales center and on a company-wide basis;
•   changes in customer preferences or regulatory requirements;
•   seasonal fluctuations in inventory levels;
•   geographic location; and
•   superseded products and new product offerings.
we periodically adjust our reserve for inventory obsolescence as changes occur in the above-identified factors. at the end of each fiscal year, we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing the prior year-end obsolescence reserve balance to (i) current year inventory write-offs and (ii) the value of products with no sales for the past 12 months that remain in inventory. based on our hindsight analysis, we concluded that our prior year reserve was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our reserve methodology is appropriate.
if the balance of our inventory reserve increased or decreased by 20% at december 31, 2015, pretax income would change by approximately $1.4 million and earnings per share would change by approximately $0.02 per diluted share (based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31, 2015).
vendor incentives many of our vendor arrangements provide for us to receive incentives of specified amounts of consideration when we achieve any of a number of measures.  these measures are generally related to the volume level of purchases from our vendors and may include negotiated pricing arrangements.  we account for vendor incentives as a reduction of the prices of the vendor's products and therefore a reduction of inventory until we sell the product, at which time such incentives are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales in our income statement.
23
throughout the year, we estimate the amount of the incentive earned based on our estimate of total purchases for the fiscal year relative to the purchase levels that mark our progress toward earning the incentives. we accrue vendor incentives on a monthly basis using these estimates provided that we determine they are probable and reasonably estimable. our estimates for annual purchases, future inventory levels and sales of qualifying products are driven by our sales projections, which can be significantly impacted by a number of external factors including weather and changes in economic conditions.  changes in our purchasing mix also impact our incentive estimates, as incentive rates can vary depending on our volume of purchases from specific vendors.
we continually revise these estimates throughout the year to reflect actual purchase levels and identifiable trends. as a result, our estimated quarterly vendor incentive accruals may include cumulative catch-up adjustments to reflect any changes in our estimates between reporting periods. these adjustments tend to have a greater impact on gross margin in the fourth quarter since it is our seasonally slowest quarter and because the majority of our vendor incentive arrangements are based on calendar year periods. we update our estimates for these arrangements at year end to reflect actual annual purchase levels. in the first quarter of the subsequent year, we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing actual vendor incentives received to the prior year vendor incentive balances. based on our hindsight analysis, we concluded that our vendor incentive estimates were within a range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodology is appropriate.
if market conditions were to change, vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs. although such changes would not affect the amounts we have recorded related to products already purchased, they may lower or raise our cost for products purchased and sold in future periods.
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse.  due to changing tax laws and state income tax rates, significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future.
as of december 31, 2015, we have not provided for united states income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, as we have invested or expect to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely.  if these earnings are repatriated to the united states in the future, or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future, additional tax provisions may be required. determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable due to the complexity of tax laws and regulations and the varying circumstances, tax treatments and timing of any future repatriation.
we hold, through our wholly owned affiliates, cash balances in the countries in which we operate, including amounts held outside the united states.  most of the amounts held outside the united states could be repatriated to the united states, but under current law, may be subject to united states federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws including the imposition of withholding taxes in some jurisdictions. historically our foreign locations have not generated adequate earnings to both repatriate to the united states and fund foreign operations. those historical and future foreign earnings will remain permanently reinvested and be used to support our foreign operations and pay non-u.s. obligations.
we have operations in 39 states, 1 united states territory and 11 foreign countries. the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to adjustment by the applicable tax authorities.  we are subject to regular audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.   we recognize a benefit from an uncertain tax position only after determining it is more likely than not that the tax position will withstand examination by the applicable taxing authority. our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. we regularly evaluate our tax positions and incorporate these expectations into our reserve estimates. we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters.  however, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire.  these adjustments may include changes in valuation allowances that we have established.  as a result of these uncertainties, our total income tax provision may fluctuate on a quarterly basis.
each year, we prepare a return to provision analysis upon filing our income tax returns. based on this hindsight analysis, we concluded that our prior year income tax provision was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our provision calculation methodology is appropriate.
24
incentive compensation accrual our incentive compensation structure is designed to attract, motivate and retain employees. our incentive compensation packages include bonus plans that are specific to each group of eligible participants and their levels and areas of responsibility. the majority of our bonus plans have annual cash payments that are based primarily on objective performance criteria, with a component based on management's discretion. we calculate bonuses based on the achievement of certain key measurable financial and operational results, including budgeted operating income and diluted earnings per share.
management sets the objectives for our bonus plans at the beginning of the bonus plan year using both historical information and forecasted results of operations for the current plan year. the compensation committee of our board approves these objectives for certain bonus plans. we record incentive compensation accruals based on positive operating income achieved in a quarter as a percentage of total expected operating income for the year. we estimate total expected operating income for the current plan year using management's estimate of the total overall incentives earned per the stated bonus plan objectives. starting in june, and continuing each quarter through our fiscal year end, we adjust our estimated incentive compensation accrual based on our detailed analysis of each bonus plan, the participants' progress toward achievement of their specific objectives and management's estimates related to the discretionary components of the bonus plans.
our quarterly incentive compensation expense and accrual balances may vary relative to actual annual bonus expense and payouts due to the following:
•   the discretionary components of the bonus plans;
•   differences between estimated and actual performance; and
•   our projections related to achievement of multiple-year performance objectives for our strategic plan incentive program.
we generally make bonus payments at the end of february following the most recently completed fiscal year. each year, we compare the actual bonus payouts to amounts accrued at the previous year end to determine the accuracy of our incentive compensation estimates. based on our hindsight analysis, we concluded that our incentive compensation accrual balances were within a reasonable range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodologies are appropriate.
impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill is our largest intangible asset. at december 31, 2015, our goodwill balance was $172.8 million, representing approximately 18% of total assets. goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed.
we perform our goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year or on a more frequent basis if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate potential impairment.  if the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units falls below its carrying value, we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying value. if the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value, we recognize the difference as an impairment loss in operating income.
since we define an operating segment as an individual sales center and we do not have operations below the sales center level, our reporting unit is an individual sales center.  as of october 1, 2015, we had 216 reporting units with allocated goodwill balances. the highest goodwill balance was $5.7 million and the average goodwill balance was $0.8 million. in october 2015, 2014 and 2013, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and did not identify any goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level.
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach that incorporates our assumptions for determining the present value of future cash flows.  we project future cash flows using management's assumptions for sales growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and multiples. these estimates can significantly affect the outcome of our impairment test. to determine the reasonableness of the assumptions included in our fair value estimates, we compare the total estimated fair value for all aggregated reporting units to our market capitalization on the date of our impairment test.  we also review for potential impairment indicators at the reporting unit level based on an evaluation of recent historical operating trends, current and projected local market conditions and other relevant factors as appropriate.
25
to test the reasonableness of our fair value estimates, we compared our aggregate estimated fair values to our market capitalization as of the date of our annual impairment test. we expect that a reasonable fair value estimate would reflect a moderate acquisition premium. our aggregate estimated fair values fell below our market capitalization, which we consider to be conservative, but reasonable for the purpose of our goodwill impairment test. to facilitate a sensitivity analysis, we reduced our consolidated fair value estimate by 5% to reflect more conservative projected cash flow assumptions, a 50 basis point increase in our estimated weighted average cost of capital or a 50 basis point decrease in the estimated perpetuity growth rate. our sensitivity analysis generated a fair value estimate significantly below our market capitalization and resulted in the identification of no goodwill impairments and no additional at-risk locations.
based on the magnitude of its goodwill balance and the continued economic challenges in italy, we currently consider our italy reporting unit as at risk for goodwill impairment. our most sensitive estimates pertain to this reporting unit's product mix and the related impact on our gross margin projections, which are incorporated into our discounted cash flow assumptions. as of december 31, 2015, our at-risk reporting unit in italy had a goodwill balance of $3.4 million. we also consider one reporting unit in quebec, canada, as at risk for goodwill impairment. results for this location began to fall below expectations in 2013, largely due to its heightened sensitivity to weather and certain execution challenges. we cannot be assured of favorable weather conditions in any given year, which strongly impact this reporting unit's results. as of december 31, 2015, our at-risk reporting unit in quebec had a goodwill balance of $2.2 million.
if our assumptions or estimates in our fair value calculations change or if operating results are less than forecasted, we could incur additional impairment charges in future periods, especially related to the reporting units discussed above.  impairment charges would decrease operating income, negatively impact diluted eps and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet.
recent accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update (asu) no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (asu 2014-09), which requires entities to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. the new standard also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity's contracts with customers. asu 2014-09 will be effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2017 and will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in u.s. gaap. the guidance may be applied using either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. we are currently evaluating the effect that asu 2014-09 will have on our financial position, results of operations and related disclosures.
in april 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-03, simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs, which requires entities to present debt issuance costs as a direct reduction of the carrying amount of the related debt liability rather than as an asset. amortization of the costs will continue to be recorded as interest expense. asu 2015-03 will be effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2015, and early adoption is permitted. we have not elected to early adopt this guidance and we do not expect the adoption of asu 2015-03 will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and related disclosures.
in july 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-11, inventory (topic 330): simplifying the measurement of inventory, which requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value rather than at the lower of cost or market. net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. asu 2015-11 will be effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. we have not elected to early adopt this guidance. we do not expect the adoption of asu 2015-11 will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and related disclosures.
in september 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-16, simplifying the accounting for measurement-period adjustments, which eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. instead, an acquirer will recognize a measurement-period adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment. asu 2015-16 will be effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. we have not elected to early adopt this guidance. we do not expect the adoption of asu 2015-16 will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and related disclosures.
26
in november 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-17, balance sheet classification of deferred taxes, which requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet rather than separately presenting net deferred tax assets or liabilities as current or noncurrent. also, companies will no longer allocate valuation allowances between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets because those allowances also will be classified as noncurrent. asu 2015-17 will be effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. we have not elected to early adopt this guidance. we do not expect the adoption of asu 2015-17 will have an impact on our results of operations, but it will change the presentation of our financial position and disclosures related to deferred tax assets and liabilities.
in february 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-02, leases, which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses in a manner similar to current guidance. asu 2016-02 will be effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2018. the guidance is required to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. we are currently evaluating the effect that asu 2016-02 will have on our financial position, results of operations and related disclosures.

(1)   we acquired certain distribution assets of each of these companies.
(2)   we completed this acquisition on december 31, 2014. we excluded this sales center from base business for the periods identified as per our definition of base business, but also because no results of operations are included in fiscal 2014 due to the acquisition date. this sales center is not in our sales center count as of december 31, 2014, but is included in the table below as an acquired location during fiscal 2015.
when calculating our base business results, we exclude sales centers that are acquired, closed or opened in new markets for a period of 15 months. we also exclude consolidated sales centers when we do not expect to maintain the majority of the existing business and existing sales centers that are consolidated with acquired sales centers.
we generally allocate corporate overhead expenses to excluded sales centers on the basis of their net sales as a percentage of total net sales.  after 15 months of operations, we include acquired, consolidated and new market sales centers in the base business calculation including the comparative prior year period.

net sales
(in millions)                           year ended december 31,
2015                    2014                      change net sales              $2,363.1                  $2,246.6         $116.5              5%
net sales increased 5% compared to 2014, including a 5% increase in base business sales. the sustained strength of the u.s. dollar relative to foreign currencies adversely impacted our consolidated sales growth rate by close to 2% during 2015. after sales exhibited a strong start in the first quarter, adverse weather conditions in the second quarter negatively impacted sales in several important markets. weather conditions normalized in the back half of the year, extending the season in certain markets and leading to year over year sales growth. a continued gradual recovery of demand for discretionary replacement and remodel products and increased market share were the primary contributors to our sales growth in 2015.
the following factors benefited our sales growth (listed in order of estimated magnitude):
•   continued improvement in consumer discretionary expenditures, including some market recovery in remodeling and replacement activity, as evidenced by sales growth rates for product offerings such as building materials and equipment (see discussion below);
•   market share growth, primarily in building materials and complementary product categories;
•   an extended pool season in certain markets, with above average temperatures through much of the fourth quarter; and
•   inflationary (estimated at less than 1%) product cost increases.
the following factors adversely impacted our sales growth (listed in order of estimated magnitude):
•   the strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to most foreign currencies (estimated 2% impact); and
•   record rainfall in texas and adjacent states in the second quarter, which delayed construction projects and reduced spending on related discretionary products.
sales of building materials grew by 13% compared to 2014. our continued strong growth in building materials primarily reflects market share growth with our expansion of stocking locations and broader product offerings as well as the partial recovery in pool remodeling. sales of equipment, which includes heaters, pumps and filters, increased by 9% compared to 2014. chemical sales increased by approximately 5%.
in terms of quarterly performance, base business sales increased 10% in the first quarter of 2015. similar to 2014, our 2015 customer early buy shipments caused some second quarter sales to shift into the first quarter and accounted for approximately 3% of our first quarter 2015 sales growth. as discussed above, adverse weather conditions in the second quarter led to flat base business sales growth trends in the second quarter of 2015 compared to 2014. normalized weather trends allowed us to generate 5% base business sales growth in the third quarter of 2015. for our seasonally slow fourth quarter, base business sales increased 10% in 2015, as our sales benefited from record warm temperatures during this time period. see discussion of significant weather impacts under the subheading seasonality and quarterly fluctuations beginning on page 35.

gross margin             28.6     %              28.6     %
gross margin for 2015 remained consistent with 2014. throughout the year, gross margin comparisons varied, with a decline of 40 basis points in the first quarter, due to the impact of customer early buy shipments. gross margin remained flat in the second quarter, declined 10 basis points in the third quarter and increased 30 basis points in the fourth quarter.

2015                    2014   change operating expenses                                       $459.4                  $454.5         $4.9              1%
operating expenses as a percentage of net sales            19.4     %              20.2     %
operating expenses increased 1% compared to 2014. increases in performance-based incentive compensation and technology related expenses were offset by tight expense controls, lower freight costs and an approximate 2% favorable impact on operating expenses from the stronger u.s. dollar relative to foreign currencies.
interest and other non-operating expenses, net interest and other non-operating expenses, net increased 8% compared to 2014. the primary component is interest expense on debt, which increased 6% over last year. average outstanding debt was $379.2 million for 2015 versus $342.9 million for 2014. our weighted average effective interest rate was 1.9% for both 2015 and 2014.
income taxes our effective income tax rate was 38.5% at december 31, 2015 compared to 38.9% at december 31, 2014. the decline in our effective income tax rate is primarily a result of improved performance by our international entities in 2015.
net income and earnings per share net income attributable to pool corporation increased 16% to $128.3 million in 2015 compared to $110.7 million in 2014, while earnings per share increased 19% to $2.90 per diluted share compared to $2.44 per diluted share in 2014.

net sales
(in millions)                           year ended december 31,
2014                    2013                      change net sales              $2,246.6                  $2,079.7         $166.9              8%
net sales increased 8% in 2014 compared to 2013, including a 7% increase in base business sales. after the late start to the 2013 pool season, we anticipated a comparative benefit from more favorable weather conditions in 2014, but this expectation did not materialize due to prolonged cold and wet weather in many of our seasonal markets, particularly canada and the northern united states. as a result, the timing of 2014 pool openings in many of those areas was similar to 2013. in 2014, base business sales increased by 5% in our seasonal markets versus 8% in our largest, year-round markets compared to 2013.
the overall base business sales increase also reflected the impact of the following (listed in order of estimated magnitude):
•   continued improvement in consumer discretionary expenditures, including gradual recovery in remodeling and replacement activity, as evidenced by sales growth rates for product offerings such as building materials and equipment (see discussion below);
•   market share gains attributed to continued improvements in customer service levels and expansion of product offerings;
•   an increase in customer early buy purchases; and
•   inflationary (estimated at approximately 1%) product cost increases.
sales of building materials and tile grew by 20% compared to 2013. our continued strong growth in building materials reflected market share growth resulting from our expansion of stocking locations and broader product offerings as well as the partial recovery in pool remodeling. sales of equipment, which includes heaters, pumps, lighting and filters, increased by approximately 11% compared to 2013. chemical sales increased by 3% while chemical pricing remained relatively flat.
base business sales increased 9% in the first quarter of 2014. approximately 2% of our first quarter sales growth reflected a change in the timing of customer early buy purchases, which effectively shifted sales into the first quarter of 2014 that historically have occurred in the second quarter. despite not having the expected benefit of a return to normal seasonal weather patterns, we realized base business sales growth of 7% and 5% in the second and third quarters of 2014. for our seasonally slow fourth quarter, base business sales increased 8% in 2014, as we capitalized on favorable weather conditions during this time period. see discussion of significant weather impacts under the subheading seasonality and quarterly fluctuations beginning on page 35.

gross margin             28.6     %              28.4     %
in 2014 gross margin increased 20 basis points compared to the previous year. we believe our efforts in various pricing and sourcing initiatives in 2014, as well as higher volume incentives from certain of our vendors contributed to this improvement. favorable product mix due to higher building materials sales growth rates and a reduction in equipment sales growth rates compared to 2013 also added some benefit given comparatively lower margins on heaters, pumps, lighting and filters. the unfavorable gross margin impact of first quarter 2014 customer early buy purchases somewhat offset these benefits. purchases included in customer early buys are primarily comprised of lower margin discretionary products and include applicable discounts.
year over year, gross margin comparisons ranged from mostly flat to slightly improved each quarter during 2014, with a decline of 20 basis points in the first quarter, due to the impact of customer early buy purchases described above, then improvements of 25 basis points in the second quarter, 50 basis points in the third quarter and 10 basis points in the fourth quarter, which also reflected some benefit from acquisitions.

operating expenses increased 7% in 2014 compared to 2013, with base business operating expenses up 5%. the increase in base business operating expenses is primarily attributed to the following (listed in order of magnitude with approximate impact):
•   greater personnel costs ($12.4 million, including a $2.7 million increase related to performance-based incentive compensation expense);
•   higher freight costs ($2.9 million);
•   increased facility-related expenses, including building rent, utilities and maintenance ($2.3 million); and
•   higher outside professional fees ($2.3 million).
interest and other non-operating expenses, net interest and other non-operating expenses, net increased 11% in 2014 compared to 2013. average outstanding debt was $342.9 million for 2014 versus $256.1 million for 2013. the weighted average effective interest rate declined to 1.9% in 2014 compared to 2.4% in 2013. the decrease in our effective interest rate reflected the utilization of available borrowing capacity on our receivables facility at lower interest rates than under our credit facility.
income taxes our effective income tax rate was 38.9% at december 31, 2014, consistent with our rate of 38.8% at december 31, 2013.
net income and earnings per share net income attributable to pool corporation increased 14% to $110.7 million in 2014 compared to $97.3 million in 2013, while earnings per share increased 19% to $2.44 per diluted share compared to $2.05 per diluted share in 2013.

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations our business is highly seasonal. in general, sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters, which represent the peak months of both swimming pool use and installation and landscape installations and maintenance. sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters, when we may incur net losses. in 2015, we generated approximately 63% of our net sales and 90% of our operating income in the second and third quarters of the year.
we typically experience a build-up of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season.  excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases, our peak borrowing usually occurs during the second quarter, primarily because extended payment terms offered by our suppliers typically are payable in april, may and june, while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in june, july and august.
the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly data for 2015 and 2014. we have included income statement and balance sheet data for the most recent eight quarters to allow for a meaningful comparison of the seasonal fluctuations in these amounts. in our opinion, this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data. due to the seasonal nature of our industry, the results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends.

note: due to rounding, the sum of quarterly percentage amounts may not equal 100%.
we expect that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired sales centers.  based on our peak summer selling season, we generally open new sales centers and close or consolidate sales centers, when warranted, either in the first quarter before the peak selling season begins or in the fourth quarter after the peak selling season ends.

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business. the table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions.
weather                                                                       possible effects hot and dry                                                               •   increased purchases of chemicals and supplies for existing swimming pools
•   increased purchases of above-ground pools and irrigation products unseasonably cool weather or                                              •   fewer pool and landscape installations extraordinary amounts of rain                                             •   decreased purchases of chemicals and supplies
•   decreased purchases of impulse items such as above-ground pools and accessories unseasonably early warming trends in spring/late cooling trends in fall   •   a longer pool and landscape season, thus positively impacting our sales
(primarily in the northern half of the u.s. and canada)
unseasonably late warming trends in spring/early cooling trends in fall   •   a shorter pool and landscape season, thus negatively impacting our sales
(primarily in the northern half of the u.s. and canada)
weather impacts on fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2014 comparisons in the first quarter of 2015, we benefited from favorable weather in most of our year-round markets, which experienced warmer-than-normal temperatures for this time of year. these warmer temperatures contributed to sales growth in maintenance products, such as chemicals, in these markets. our seasonal markets experienced cooler than normal temperatures, particularly in the northeast united states and eastern canada, which experienced another year of near record cold temperatures and substantial snowfall, inhibiting sales growth in these areas. after our strong start, adverse weather conditions in the second quarter negatively impacted sales in several important markets. the second quarter of 2015 marked the wettest on record for much of texas and oklahoma and reflected significant precipitation for most states in the south and central united states. this excessive precipitation significantly impacted our second quarter sales, delaying construction projects and reducing spending on related discretionary products. cooler than normal temperatures in the midwest and the northeast in june, coupled with substantial rainfall, also delayed pool openings and hampered sales growth in these seasonal markets.
weather conditions improved in the back half of the year as our third quarter 2015 sales benefited from a return to more normalized weather. the warmer than average temperatures and drier than normal conditions experienced throughout much of the united states later in the third quarter contributed to our sales growth. a mild september in the northeast, which continued well into the fourth quarter, also extended the season in these markets. as reflected in our fourth quarter sales growth, most areas east of the mississippi river experienced the warmest temperatures on record through november and december.
weather impacts on fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2013 comparisons after the late start to the 2013 pool season, we anticipated a comparative benefit from more favorable weather conditions in 2014. however, our seasonal markets experienced cooler than normal temperatures yet another year. the northeast, parts of the midwest and eastern canada experienced near record cold temperatures and substantial snowfall during the first quarter of 2014. cold and wet weather persisted through april and may of 2014, particularly in canada and the northern united states, limiting second quarter sales growth in many of our seasonal markets. through may, late season snow impacted the rocky mountain region, while parts of the midwest felt the impact of much-delayed thawing from snowfall in the winter and early spring. similar conditions continued through the third quarter as parts of the northeast and substantially all of the southeast and central portions of the united states experienced cooler than normal temperatures.
36
our largest, year-round markets experienced quite different weather conditions in 2014 as temperatures in florida were normal to above average, and the west experienced warmer than average to record high temperatures almost all year, especially california and arizona. however, severe drought conditions persisted in parts of california and arizona through the second quarter, which limited second quarter sales growth in these markets. temperatures and rainfall were closer to normal in texas and the southeast united states during the second quarter, which provided some relief from the difficult conditions we faced in other areas. despite rainfall during the third and fourth quarters, severe drought conditions continued to afflict california. drought conditions also developed in texas, while the southwest accumulated significant rainfall during the third quarter. in our seasonally slow fourth quarter, temperatures and precipitation levels ranged from normal to above average for most of the united states.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet short-term and long-term cash needs. we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities, taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business. significant factors which could affect our liquidity include the following:
•   cash flows generated from operating activities;
•   the adequacy of available bank lines of credit;
•   acquisitions;
•   scheduled debt repayments;
•   dividend payments;
•   capital expenditures;
•   the timing and extent of share repurchases; and
•   the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms.
our primary capital needs are seasonal working capital obligations and other general corporate initiatives, including acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings, which have historically been sufficient to support our growth and finance acquisitions. the same principle applies to funds used for capital expenditures and share repurchases.
we prioritize our use of cash based on investing in our business, maintaining a prudent debt structure and returning money to our shareholders. our specific priorities for the use of cash are as follows:
•   maintenance and new sales center capital expenditures;
•   strategic acquisitions executed opportunistically; and
•   payment of cash dividends as and when declared by the board.
as discussed further under the subheading future sources and uses of cash on page 38, we are required to comply with certain financial covenants under our debt agreements, including the maintenance of a maximum average total leverage ratio. although more conservative than the maximum, we strive to maintain an average total leverage ratio of 1.50 to 2.00. within the constraints of these metrics, we determine the timing and extent to which we will repurchase our common stock under board authorized repurchase programs and/or repay our debt.
over the last five years, capital expenditures have averaged roughly 1.0% of net sales. capital expenditures were 1.0% of net sales in 2015, 0.8% of net sales in 2014 and 0.9% of net sales in 2013. going forward, we project capital expenditures will be 1.0% to 1.5% of net sales as we expand facilities and purchase delivery vehicles to address growth opportunities.
sources and uses of cash the following table summarizes our cash flows (in thousands):
year ended december 31,
2015                   2014                    2013

cash provided by operations of $146.1 million in 2015 exceeded net income by $17.8 million.  compared to 2014, cash provided by operations increased primarily due to higher net income and improvements in the seasonal purchasing and payment cycle. in 2014, cash provided by operations exceeded net income by $10.8 million and improved compared to 2013 due to our net income growth and working capital management.
cash used in investing activities for 2015 includes $4.3 million in net payments to fund a revolving note under a credit agreement, which we entered into as a lender in 2015. for additional information regarding the revolving note, see note 1 of our "notes to consolidated financial statements" included in item 8 of this form 10-k. an additional $11.8 million of net capital expenditures in 2015 compared to 2014 funded our continued investment in new vehicles, equipment and technology and was offset by a $6.2 million decline in payments for acquisitions. our 2014 cash used in investing activities reflects $10.6 million in net payments to fund four acquisitions, including our acquisition of pool systems pty. ltd. our 2013 cash used in investing activities mainly reflects ongoing capital expenditures as we acted on limited acquisition opportunities that year.
cash used in financing activities increased in 2015, reflecting lower net borrowings on our debt arrangements due to the increase in cash provided by operating activities and the decrease in share repurchases. we had $8.9 million of net proceeds from our debt arrangements in 2015 compared to $73.4 million in 2014, while we repurchased $92.4 million of shares in the open market in 2015, down $40.0 million compared to 2014. cash used in financing activities declined in 2014 mostly due to increases in our net borrowings, partially offset by greater repurchases of our shares in the open market and lower proceeds from the issuance of common stock. we had $73.4 million of net proceeds from our debt arrangements in 2014 compared to $15.5 million in 2013. in 2014, we repurchased $132.3 million of shares in the open market, up $38.0 million compared to 2013.
future sources and uses of cash as amended on november 20, 2014, our credit facility provides for $465.0 million in borrowing capacity under a five-year revolving credit facility and includes sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans and standby letters of credit.  pursuant to an accordion feature, the aggregate maximum principal amount of the commitments under the credit facility may be increased at our request and with agreement by the lenders by up to $75.0 million, to a total of $540.0 million.  on november 20, 2015, we extended the maturity date of the agreement to november 20, 2020. we intend to use the credit facility for general corporate purposes and to fund future growth initiatives.
at december 31, 2015, there was $273.0 million outstanding and $188.0 million available for borrowing under the credit facility.  we currently have five interest rate swap contracts in place that reduce our exposure to fluctuations in variable interest rates for future interest payments on the credit facility.  these swap contracts convert the credit facility's variable interest rate to fixed rates of 1.185% on notional amounts totaling $50.0 million, 1.100% on a notional amount of $50.0 million, 1.050% on a notional amount of $25.0 million and 0.990% on a notional amount of $25.0 million.  interest expense related to the notional amounts under these swaps is based on the fixed rates plus the applicable margin on the credit facility.  all five swap contracts will terminate on october 19, 2016.
in may 2014, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swap contracts to reduce our exposure to future fluctuations in interest rates on our credit facility. in an effort to bring the fixed rates per our forward-starting contracts in line with current market rates and extend the hedged period for future interest payments on our credit facility, we amended the terms of the swaps in the fourth quarter of 2015. as amended, these new swap contracts will convert the credit facility's variable interest rate to fixed rates of 2.273% on a notional amount of $75.0 million and 2.111% on notional amounts totaling $75.0 million. each of these forward-starting interest rate swap contracts becomes effective on october 19, 2016 and terminates on november 20, 2019.
the weighted average effective interest rate for the credit facility as of december 31, 2015 was approximately 2.0%, excluding commitment fees.
38
financial covenants on the credit facility include maintenance of a maximum average total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which are our most restrictive financial covenants.  as of december 31, 2015, the calculations of these two covenants are detailed below:
•   maximum average total leverage ratio. on the last day of each fiscal quarter, our average total leverage ratio must be less than 3.25 to 1.00. average total leverage ratio is the ratio of the trailing twelve months (ttm) average total funded indebtedness plus the ttm average accounts securitization proceeds divided by the ttm ebitda (as those terms are defined in the credit facility). as of december 31, 2015, our average total leverage ratio equaled 1.61 (compared to 1.66 as of december 31, 2014) and the ttm average total debt amount used in this calculation was $390.1 million.
•   minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. on the last day of each fiscal quarter, our fixed charge ratio must be greater than or equal to 2.25 to 1.00. fixed charge ratio is the ratio of the ttm ebitdar divided by ttm interest expense paid or payable in cash plus ttm rental expense (as those terms are defined in the credit facility). as of december 31, 2015, our fixed charge ratio equaled 5.18 (compared to 4.63 as of december 31, 2014) and ttm rental expense was $49.5 million.
the credit facility also limits the declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock to no more than 50% of the preceding year's net income (as defined in the credit facility), provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, or would result from the payment of dividends.  additionally, we may declare and pay quarterly dividends notwithstanding that the aggregate amount of dividends paid would be in excess of the 50% limit described above so long as (i) the amount per share of such dividends does not exceed the amount per share paid during the most recent fiscal year in which we were in compliance with the 50% limit and (ii) our average total leverage ratio is less than 3.00 to 1.00 both immediately before and after giving pro forma effect to such dividends. further, dividends must be declared and paid in a manner consistent with our past practice.
under the credit facility, we may repurchase shares of our common stock provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, or would result from the repurchase of shares, and our maximum average total leverage ratio (determined on a pro forma basis) is less than 2.50 to 1.00.  other covenants include restrictions on our ability to grant liens, incur indebtedness, make investments, merge or consolidate, and sell or transfer assets.  failure to comply with any of our financial covenants or any other terms of the credit facility could result in penalty payments, higher interest rates on our borrowings or the acceleration of the maturities of our outstanding debt.
as amended on october 15, 2015, our two-year receivables facility offers us a lower cost form of financing, with a peak funding capacity of up to $200.0 million between may 1 and june 30, which includes an additional seasonal funding capacity that is available between march 1 and july 31. other funding capacities range from $55.0 million to $135.0 million throughout the remaining months of the year.
the receivables facility provides for the sale of certain of our receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary (the securitization subsidiary). the securitization subsidiary transfers variable undivided percentage interests in the receivables and related rights to certain third party financial institutions in exchange for cash proceeds, limited to the applicable funding capacities. upon payment of the receivables by customers, rather than remitting to the financial institutions the amounts collected, we retain such collections as proceeds for the sale of new receivables until payments become due.
the receivables facility contains terms and conditions (including representations, covenants and conditions precedent) customary for transactions of this type. additionally, an amortization event will occur if we fail to maintain a maximum average total leverage ratio (average total funded debt/ebitda) of 3.25 to 1.00 and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (ebitdar/cash interest expense plus rental expense) of 2.25 to 1.00.
at december 31, 2015, there was $55.0 million outstanding under the receivables facility at a weighted average effective interest rate of 1.2%, excluding commitment fees.
as of december 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements.  we believe we will remain in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements throughout 2016.  for additional information regarding our debt arrangements, see note 5 of "notes to consolidated financial statements," included in item 8 of this form 10-k.

for additional discussion related to our debt, see note 5 of "notes to consolidated financial statements," included in item 8 of this form 10-k.  the table below contains estimated interest payments (in thousands) related to our long-term debt obligations listed in the table above.  our estimates of future interest payments are calculated based on the december 31, 2015 outstanding debt balances, using the fixed rates under our interest rate swap agreements for the applicable notional amounts and the weighted average effective interest rates as of december 31, 2015 for the remaining outstanding balances not covered by our swaps.  to project the estimated interest expense to coincide with the time periods used in the table above, we have projected the estimated debt balances for future years based on the scheduled maturity dates of the credit facility and the receivables facility. for certain of our contractual obligations, such as unrecognized tax benefits, uncertainties exist regarding the timing of future payments and the amount by which these potential obligations will increase or decrease over time. as such, we have excluded unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table. see note 7 of "notes to consolidated financial statements," included in item 8 of this form 10-k for more information related to our unrecognized tax benefits.

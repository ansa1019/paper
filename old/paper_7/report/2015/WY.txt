management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a)
what you will find in this md&amp;a our md&a includes the following major sections:
•   economic and market conditions affecting our operations;
•   financial performance summary;
•   results of our operations - consolidated and by segment;
•   liquidity and capital resources - where we discuss our cash flows;
•   off-balance sheet arrangements;
•   environmental matters, legal proceedings and other contingencies; and
•   accounting matters - where we discuss critical accounting policies and areas requiring judgments and estimates.
economic and market conditions affecting our operations the strength of the u.s. housing market strongly affects our wood products and timberlands segments. as published by the u.s. census bureau, total u.s. housing starts for 2015 were 1,111,000 units, with single-family units accounting for 715,000 of the total. this represents a 10 percent increase in single-family starts from 2014, which were 648,000 units. multi-family construction also increased in 2015 to 396,000 units compared with 358,000 in 2014. expectations are for a similar increase in 2016. consensus forecasts place expected total housing starts between 1.2 and 1.3 million units for 2016. sources include ihs global insight, john burns real estate and risi. while housing has improved significantly since the recession of 2009, current demand for new housing continues to run below historic pre bubble averages. the 25-year period of 1976-2000 averaged 1.5 million total starts and 1.1 million single family starts, levels which have not yet been achieved in the post recession period.
wood products primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets. demand for wood products continued to improve in 2015 following the growth in home construction, however, growth in production also expanded and prices were lower in 2015 than 2014. the random lengths framing lumber composite was 14 percent lower in 2015 versus 2014 while oriented strand board (osb) was 4 percent lower in 2015 as measured by random lengths north central price. expectations are for similar to slightly higher wood product prices in 2016 as demand continues to increase with growth in housing starts and remodeling.
demand for logs from our timberlands segment is affected by the production of wood-based building products as well as export demand in our western holdings. in the south, southern pine sawlog prices were flat to slightly higher in 2015 as available supplies continue to match or exceed growth in demand. western log prices were lower in 2015 due primarily to the pullback in demand from china which had been actively competing with domestic lumber producers for sawlogs. expectations are for slightly improved log prices as off-shore demand improves over 2015 and domestic wood products manufacturing output increases with rising housing starts creating increased log demand.
cellulose fibers is primarily affected by global supply and demand factors and the relative strength of the u.s. dollar. the slowdown in global growth and reduced expectations for emerging economies slowed demand growth for pulp in 2015. the u.s. dollar continued to strengthen versus the euro in 2015, rising 12 percent due to stronger us economic growth and increasingly accommodative monetary policies in eurozone economies. consequently prices for benchmark nbsk pulp were 8% lower in 2015 versus 2014. expectations are for similar to slightly lower prices in 2016 as global economic growth is expected to be weak, which will limit growth in demand for products made with cellulose fibers. furthermore, the us dollar is expected to remain strong relative to other currencies including the euro and a weak euro has historically been associated with lower us dollar prices for cellulose fibers.

comparing 2015 with 2014
net sales net sales decreased $321 million - 4 percent - primarily due to:
•   lower timberlands segment sales - $147 million - primarily due to lower average log sales realizations and export sales volumes in the west, and lower log sales volumes in the south;
•   lower wood products segment sales - $98 million - primarily due to decreased structural lumber and osb average realizations, partially offset by higher structural lumber, osb, and engineered solid section sales volumes and higher sales of complementary building products; and
•   lower cellulose fibers segment sales - $76 million - primarily due to lower pulp and liquid packaging board average sales realizations.
net earnings attributable to weyerhaeuser common shareholders our net earnings attributable to weyerhaeuser common shareholders decreased $1,320 million primarily due to:
•   earnings from discontinued operation recognized in 2014 - $998 million. there were no earnings from discontinued operations in 2015;
•   lower gross margin - $252 million - primarily due to lower average sales realizations in lumber and osb in our wood products segment, lower average log sales realizations and sales volumes in our timberlands segment, and lower average sales realizations for pulp and liquid packaging board, and higher operating costs due to scheduled maintenance outages and the west coast port slowdown in our cellulose fibers segment;
•   lower other operating income - $219 million - primarily due to a $151 million pretax gain recognized in 2014 related to a previously announced postretirement plan amendment, a $22 million pretax gain recognized in 2014 on the sale of a landfill in washington state, $14 million of plum creek merger-related costs in 2015, and a $13 million noncash impairment charge related to a nonstrategic asset sale in 2015; and
•   losses from an equity affiliate in 2015 - $105 million - primarily due to an $84 million noncash asset impairment recorded by an equity affiliate in the fourth quarter 2015.
these decreases were partially offset by:
•   lower income taxes - $188 million - primarily due to lower earnings in our taxable reit subsidiary (trs) in 2015, an income tax benefit recognized in the fourth quarter 2015 related to a noncash asset impairment recorded by an equity affiliate and the expiration of the company's built-in-gains tax period as a result of a change in u.s. tax legislation; and
•   lower general and administrative expenses - $49 million.
comparing 2014 with 2013
net sales net sales increased $149 million - 2 percent - primarily due to:
•   timberlands segment sales increased $154 million, primarily due to higher log prices and increased sales volumes in the west, including our acquired longview timber holdings.
•   cellulose fibers segment sales increased $34 million primarily due to higher sales realizations for pulp.
weyerhaeuser company > 2015 annual report and form 10-k 39
these increases were partially offset by a $39 million decrease in our wood products segment sales, primarily due to lower sales realizations for osb. this decrease in sales was partially offset by higher sales realizations and volumes for engineered wood products and lumber and increased sales from complementary building products.
net earnings attributable to weyerhaeuser common shareholders our net earnings attributable to weyerhaeuser common shareholders increased $1,242 million primarily due to:
•   a $926 million increase in earnings from discontinued operations, primarily due to a $972 million net gain on the real estate divestiture recognized in 2014;
•   a $333 million decrease in charges for restructuring, closure and asset impairments primarily related to a noncash impairment charge relating to a large master-planned community north of las vegas, nevada which was retained by weyerhaeuser in the divestiture of weyerhaeuser real estate company (wreco);
•   a $206 million increase in gross margin in our timberlands and cellulose fibers segments, primarily due to higher sales realizations and owning longview timber for a full year;
•   a $166 million increase in other operating income, primarily due to a $151 million pretax gain recognized in 2014 related to a previously announced postretirement plan amendment; and
•   a $79 million decrease in our selling, general and administrative expenses.
these increases were partially offset by:
•   a $356 million change in income taxes from a benefit in 2013 to an expense in 2014 primarily related to a previously unrecognized tax benefit recorded in 2013 and higher earnings in our taxable reit subsidiary (trs) in 2014; and
•   a $140 million decrease in gross margin in our wood products segment, primarily due to lower sales realizations in osb.

comparing 2015 with 2014
net sales - unaffiliated customers net sales to unaffiliated customers decreased $147 million - 10 percent - primarily due to a $142 million decrease in western log sales as a result of lower average sales realizations and export sales volumes, and a $16 million decrease in southern log sales due to lower sales volumes.
intersegment sales intersegment sales decreased $37 million - 4 percent - primarily due to a $20 million decrease in canada due to lower translated revenues as a result of the strengthening u.s. dollar, and a $17 million decrease in the united states due to lower southern log sales volumes and decreased western average realizations.
net contribution to earnings net contribution to earnings decreased $64 million - 10 percent - primarily due to:
•   lower average log sales realizations in the west - $106 million and
•   lower sales volumes in the west and south - $46 million.
these decreases were partially offset by:
•   lower operating costs, primarily due to lower logging and silviculture costs in the south and lower log purchases in the west - $68 million;
•   higher average sales realizations in the south - $13 million; and
•   lower selling, general and administrative expenses - $11 million.
comparing 2014 with 2013
net sales - unaffiliated customers net sales to unaffiliated customers increased $154 million - 11 percent - primarily due to a $144 million increase in western log sales due to higher log prices from our legacy western timberlands and a 17 percent increase in sales volumes including the increase related to the acquired longview timber holdings.
intersegment sales intersegment sales increased $68 million - 9 percent - primarily due to:
•   higher sales volume in the united states including the increase related to acquired longview timber holdings, and higher log prices in our legacy western and southern timberlands - $58 million; and
•   higher log and chip sales volumes in canada - $10 million.
net contribution to earnings net contribution to earnings increased $143 million - 30 percent - primarily due to:
•   an $87 million increase as a result of owning longview timber for a full year;
•   a $59 million increase due to higher log prices in our legacy western timberlands and southern timberlands;
•   a $20 million increase due to higher sales volumes in our legacy western timberlands; and
•   a $12 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding longview timber.
these increases were partially offset by a $40 million increase in operating costs in our legacy western timberlands due to increased log purchases.

•   $(171) million in 2013.
during 2015, our provision for income taxes decreased $188 million as compared with 2014, primarily due to lower earnings in our trs in 2015.  we also recorded a $13 million tax benefit for the expiration of the company's built-in-gains tax period due to a change in tax law in the fourth quarter 2015, and a $28 million tax benefit for the reduction in the deferred tax liability associated with an equity affiliate resulting from a non-cash impairment charge recorded by that entity.

as a reit, we generally are not subject to corporate level tax on income of the reit that is distributed to shareholders. we are no longer subject to corporate taxes on built-in-gains (the excess of fair market value over tax basis at january 1, 2010) due to a change in tax law in the fourth quarter 2015, which statutorily shortened the built-in-gains tax period from 10 years to 5 years following the reit conversion. we continue to be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our trs, which includes our manufacturing businesses and the portion of our timberlands segment income included in the trs.

liquidity and capital resources we are committed to maintaining a sound, conservative capital structure that enables us to:
•   protect the interests of our shareholders and lenders and
•   have access at all times to major financial markets.
cash from operations cash from operations includes:
•   cash received from customers;
•   cash paid to employees and suppliers;
•   cash paid for interest on our debt; and
•   cash paid or received for taxes.
consolidated net cash provided by our operations was:
•   $1,064 million in 2015,
•   $1,088 million in 2014 and
•   $1,004 million in 2013.
comparing 2015 with 2014
net cash provided by operations decreased $24 million in 2015 as compared with 2014, primarily due to:
•   cash received from customers decreased $296 million as sales decreased in our timberlands, wood products, and cellulose fibers segments.
•   net cash outflows related to income taxes decreased $66 million. we paid income taxes of $14 million in 2015 and received tax refunds of $52 million in 2014.
•   cash paid for interest increased $28 million, primarily due to interest received related to tax refunds in 2014.
these outflows were partially offset by a $393 million decrease in cash paid to employees and suppliers.
comparing 2014 with 2013
net cash provided by operations increased $84 million in 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily due to:
•   cash received from customers increased $180 million as sales increased in our timberlands and cellulose fibers segments.
•   net cash inflows related to income taxes increased $70 million. we received income tax refunds of $52 million in 2014 and paid $18 million in 2013.
•   cash paid for interest decreased $43 million, primarily due to interest received related to tax refunds in 2014 and refinancing of debt in 2013.
these inflows were partially offset by a $189 million increase in cash paid to employees and suppliers primarily due to increased production and the acquisition of longview timber.
pension contributions and benefit payments made and expected during 2015, we:
•   contributed $33 million for our canadian registered plan in accordance with minimum funding rules and respective provincial regulations;
•   contributed to or made benefit payments for our canadian nonregistered pension plans of $3 million;
•   made benefit payments of $24 million for our u.s. nonqualified pension plans; and
•   made benefit payments of $23 million for our u.s. and canadian other postretirement plans.
there was no minimum required contribution for our u.s. qualified plan for 2015, nor were any contributions made to this plan in 2015.
weyerhaeuser company > 2015 annual report and form 10-k 45
during 2016, based on estimated year-end assets and projections of plan liabilities, we expect to:
•   be required to contribute approximately $16 million for our canadian registered plan;
•   be required to contribute or make benefit payments for our canadian nonregistered plans of $3 million;
•   make benefit payments of $19 million for our u.s. nonqualified pension plans; and
•   make benefit payments of $22 million for our u.s. and canadian other postretirement plans.
we do not anticipate a contribution being required to our u.s. qualified pension plan for 2016.
investing in our business cash from investing activities includes:
•   acquisitions of property, equipment, timberlands and reforestation;
•   investments in or distribution from equity affiliates;
•   proceeds from sale of assets and operations; and
•   purchases and redemptions of short-term investments.
consolidated net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was:
•   $(487) million in 2015,
•   $361 million in 2014 and
•   $(1,829) million in 2013.
comparing 2015 with 2014
net cash from investing activities changed $848 million to an outflow in 2015 as compared with an inflow in 2014, primarily due to:
•   net proceeds from the real estate divestiture, net of cash divested in 2014; and
•   higher capital spending in 2015.
comparing 2014 with 2013
net cash from investing activities changed $2,190 million to an inflow in 2014 as compared with an outflow in 2013, primarily due to:
•   the acquisition of longview timber in 2013;
•   net proceeds from the real estate divestiture, net of cash divested in 2014; and
•   higher capital spending in 2014.
longview timber purchase on july 23, 2013, we purchased 100 percent of the equity interests in longview timber llc (longview timber) for $1.58 billion cash and assumed debt of $1.07 billion, for an aggregate purchase price of $2.65 billion. more information can be found in note 4: acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the "cash from financing activities" section below.
real estate divestiture at the close of the real estate divestiture in july 2014, wreco used $744 million of the debt proceeds to repay intercompany debt and interest to weyerhaeuser company. the newly issued debt, remaining proceeds and other wreco assets and liabilities, including $5 million cash on hand, were acquired by tri pointe homes, inc. (tri pointe) when wreco became a wholly-owned subsidiary of tri pointe at the closing of the transaction. additionally, $32 million related to the adjustment amount payable pursuant to the terms of the transaction agreement was paid to tri pointe. our net cash proceeds in connection with the real estate divestiture totaled $707 million. more information can be found in note 3: discontinued operations and the "cash from financing activities" section below.

we expect our net capital expenditures for 2016 to be down slightly compared to 2015, subject to the outcome of the strategic review of the cellulose fibers business and our transaction with plum creek. the amount we spend on capital expenditures could change due to:
•   future economic conditions,
•   environmental regulations,
•   changes in the composition of our business,
•   weather and
•   timing of equipment purchases.

(1) amounts presented for interest payments assume that all long-term debt obligations outstanding as of december 31, 2015 will remain outstanding until maturity, and interest rates on variable-rate debt in effect as of december 31, 2015 will remain in effect until maturity.(2) purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. purchase obligations exclude arrangements that the company can cancel without penalty.(3) harvest commitments are purchased at market value and can be resold at market value in the future.(4) the timing of certain of these payments will be triggered by retirements or other events. these payments can include workers' compensation, deferred compensation and banked vacation, among other obligations. when the timing of payment is uncertain, the amounts are included in the total column only. minimum pension funding is required by established funding standards and estimates are not made beyond 2016. estimated payments of contractually obligated postretirement benefits are not included due to the uncertainty of payment timing.(5) we have recognized total liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of $7 million as of december 31, 2015, including interest of $1 million. the timing of payments related to these obligations is uncertain; however, none of this amount is expected to be paid within the next year.
off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements have not had - and are not reasonably likely to have - a material effect on our current or future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. note 10: variable interest entities and note 12: lines of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements contain our disclosures of:
•   surety bonds,
•   letters of credit and guarantees and

environmental matters, legal proceedings and other contingencies see note 15: legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
accounting matters critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and estimates. they also have a high degree of complexity.
in accounting, we base our judgments and estimates on:
•   historical experience and
•   assumptions we believe are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances.
actual results, however, may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded.
our most critical accounting policies relate to our:
•   pension and postretirement benefit plans;
•   potential impairments of long-lived assets; and
•   legal, environmental and product liability reserves.
details about our other significant accounting policies - what we use and how we estimate - are in note 1: summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

pension and postretirement benefit plans we sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees. key assumptions we use in accounting for the plans include our:
•   expected long-term rate of return on plan assets,
•   discount rates,
•   anticipated trends in health care costs,
•   assumed increases in salaries and
•   mortality rates.
at the end of every year, we review our assumptions with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate. actual experience that differs from our assumptions or any changes in our assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
other factors that affect our accounting for the plans include:
•   actual pension fund performance,
•   level of lump sum distributions,
•   plan changes and amendments,
•   changes in plan participation or coverage and
•   portfolio changes and restructuring.
this section provides more information about our:
•   expected long-term rate of return and
•   discount rates.
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans. the expected long-term rate of return is our estimate of the long-term rate of return that our plan assets will earn. our expected long-term rate of return is important in determining the net periodic benefit or cost we recognize for our plans.
over the 30 years it has been in place, our u.s. pension trust investment strategy has achieved a 14.2 percent net compound annual return rate.
after considering available information at the end of 2015, we continue to assume an expected long-term rate of return of 9.0 percent. factors we considered include:
•   the net compounded annual return of 8.0 percent achieved by our u.s. pension trust investment strategy the past 5 years and
•   current and expected valuation levels in the global equity and credit markets.
our expected long-term rate of return is important in determining the net periodic benefit or cost we recognize for our plans. every 0.5 percent decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:
•   $24 million for our u.s. qualified pension plans and
•   $4 million for our canadian registered pension plans.
the actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected long-term rate of return. actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans. differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return are reflected as adjustments to cumulative other comprehensive income (loss), a component of total equity.
discount rates our discount rates as of december 31, 2015, are:
•   4.5 percent for our u.s. pension plans - compared with 4.1 percent at december 31, 2014;
•   4.0 percent for our u.s. postretirement plans - compared with 3.6 percent at december 31, 2014;
•   4.0 percent for our canadian pension plans - compared with 3.9 percent at december 31, 2014; and
•   3.9 percent for our canadian postretirement plans - compared with 3.8 percent at december 31, 2014.
we review our discount rates annually and revise them as needed. the discount rates are selected at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits.
pension and postretirement benefit expenses for 2016 will be based on the 4.5 percent and 4.0 percent assumed discount rates for u.s. plans and 4 percent and 3.9 percent assumed discount rates for the canadian plans.
our discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans. a 0.5 percent decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:
•   $35 million for our u.s. qualified pension plans and
•   $5 million for our canadian registered pension plans.

long-lived assets we review the carrying value of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations. the carrying value is the amount assigned to long-lived assets in our financial statements.
an impairment occurs when the carrying value of long-lived assets will not be recovered from future cash flows and is more than fair market value. fair market value is the estimated amount we would receive if we were to sell the assets.
in determining fair market value and whether impairment has occurred, we are required to estimate:
•   future cash flows,
•   residual values and
•   fair values of the assets.
key assumptions we use in developing the estimates include:
•   probability of alternative outcomes,
•   product pricing,
•   raw material costs,
•   product sales and
•   discount rate.
contingent liabilities we are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses.
we record contingent liabilities when:
•   it becomes probable that we will have to make payments and
•   the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including:
•   historical experience,
•   judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts and
•   recommendations of legal counsel.
in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that an ultimate loss may occur.
while we do our best in developing our projections, recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. if estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges in other (income) expense, net. these exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flow in any given quarter or year. see note 15: legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.

performance measures we use adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization (adjusted ebitda) as a key performance measure to evaluate the performance of the consolidated company and our business segments. this measure should not be considered in isolation from and is not intended to represent an alternative to our results reported in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap). however, we believe adjusted ebitda provides meaningful supplemental information about our operating performance, better facilitates period to period comparisons, and is widely used by analysts, lenders, rating agencies and other interested parties.our definition of adjusted ebitda may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies. adjusted ebitda, as we define it, is operating income from continuing operations adjusted for depreciation, depletion, amortization, pension and postretirement costs not allocated to business segments (primarily interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial loss and amortization of prior service cost/credit), special items and discontinued operations.

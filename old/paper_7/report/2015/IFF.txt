(unless indicated otherwise, dollars in millions except per share amounts)
overview company background we create, manufacture and supply flavors and fragrances (including cosmetic active ingredients) that are used in the food, beverage, personal care and household products industries either in the form of compounds or individual ingredients, including cosmetic active ingredients. our flavors and fragrance compounds combine a number of ingredients that are blended, mixed or reacted together to produce proprietary formulas created by our flavorists and perfumers.
flavors are the key building blocks that impart taste experiences in food and beverage products and, as such, play a significant role in determining consumer preference of the end products in which they are used. as a leading creator of flavors, we help our customers deliver on the promise of delicious and healthy foods and drinks that appeal to consumers. while we are a global leader, our flavors business is more regional in nature, with different formulas that reflect local taste preferences. our flavors compounds are ultimately used by our customers in four end-use categories: (1) savory, (2) beverages, (3) sweet and (4) dairy.
we are a global leader in the creation of fragrance compounds that are integral elements in the world's finest perfumes and best-known consumer products, within fabric care, home care, personal wash, hair care and toiletries products. our fragrances business consists of fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients. our fragrance compounds are defined into broad categories, (1) fine fragrances and (2) consumer fragrances. consumer fragrances consists of five end-use categories of products: (1) fabric care, (2) home care, (3) personal wash, (4) hair care and (5) toiletries. in addition, fragrance ingredients, that are used internally and sold to third parties, including customers and competitors, for use in preparation of compounds, and cosmetic active ingredients, which consist of active and functional ingredients, are included in the fragrances business unit.
the flavors and fragrances market is part of a larger market which supplies a wide variety of ingredients and compounds that are used in consumer products. the broader market includes large multinational companies or smaller regional and local participants which supply products such as seasonings, texturizers, spices, enzymes, certain food-related commodities, fortified products and cosmetic active ingredients. the global market for flavors and fragrances has expanded consistently, primarily as a result of an increase in demand for, as well as an increase in the variety of, consumer products containing flavors and fragrances. in 2014, the flavors and fragrances market, in which we compete, was estimated by management to be at least $18 billion and is forecasted to grow to approximately $21.6 billion by 2019, primarily driven by expected growth in emerging markets; however the exact size of the global market is not available due to fragmentation of data. we estimate the market size for cosmetic active ingredients to be approximately $1.5 billion as of 2015. we, together with the other top three companies, are estimated to represent approximately two-thirds of the total estimated sales in the global flavors and fragrances sub-segment of the broader market.
development of new flavors and fragrance compounds is driven by a variety of sources, including requests from our customers, who are in need of a specific flavor or fragrance for use in a new or modified consumer product, or as a result of
31
internal initiatives stemming from our consumer insights program. our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal of the flavor or fragrance. it then becomes a collaborative process between our researchers, our product development team and our customers to perfect the flavor or fragrance so that it is ready to be included in the final consumer product.
2015 overview during the third quarter of 2015, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of lucas meyer cosmetics, a business of unipex group, ("lucas meyer") for approximately euro 284.0 million ($312.0 million). (the total shares acquired include shares effectively acquired pursuant to put and call option agreements). this acquisition did not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of comprehensive income. the acquisition strengthened and expanded fragrance ingredients.
during the second quarter of 2015, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of henry h. ottens manufacturing co., inc. ("ottens flavors") for $198.9 million. the acquisition did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. the acquisition strengthened our flavors market position in the targeted north american market.
our 25 largest customers accounted for 52% of total sales in 2015; this percentage has remained fairly constant for several years. sales to our largest customer across all end-use categories accounted for 12% of our sales for each of the last three fiscal years. a key factor for commercial success is inclusion on our strategic customers' core supplier lists, which provides opportunities to win new business. we are on the core supplier lists of a large majority of our global and strategic customers within fragrances and flavors.
sales in 2015 declined 2% on a reported basis but increased 5% on a currency neutral basis (which excludes the effects of changes in currency), with the effects of acquisitions contributing approximately 2% to both reported and currency neutral basis growth rates. flavors achieved currency neutral growth of 6%, including approximately half of the growth coming from acquisitions. fragrances achieved currency neutral growth of 4% in 2015, including approximately a quarter of the growth coming from acquisitions. the currency neutral growth of 3%, excluding acquisitions, reflects new win performance (net of losses) in both flavors and fragrance compounds partially offset by volume erosion on existing business principally driven by our customers' product line rationalization and inventory management efforts. in addition, our flavors business was negatively impacted by volume erosion in north america (noam) as well as weak demand and lost business in china (principally associated with facility issues). additionally, fragrance ingredients sales were up 2%, which was driven entirely by the inclusion of acquisitions. overall, our 2015 results continued to be driven by our strong emerging market presence that represented 51% of total sales and experienced 5% currency neutral growth in 2015. from a geographic perspective, all regions delivered currency neutral growth on a consolidated basis in 2015; led by latin america (la) with 9% currency neutral sales growth.
the year 2014 included an extra week of activity, due to the timing of our fiscal year-end (as discussed in note 1 of the consolidated financial statements). the impact of this week was not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2014.

financial performance overview reported sales for 2015 decreased 2% year-over-year (including approximately 2% growth from acquisitions). we continue to benefit from our diverse portfolio of end-use product categories and geographies and had currency neutral sales growth in all four regions and in consumer fragrances and flavor compounds. both flavors and fragrances benefited from new win performance (net of losses) and the effect of acquisitions, that were partially offset by volume erosion on existing business principally driven by our customers' product line rationalization and inventory management efforts. in addition, our flavors business was negatively impacted by volume erosion in noam as well as weak demand and lost business in china (principally associated with facility issues). exchange rate variations represented a 7% decrease in year-over-year sales. the effect of exchange rates can vary by business and region depending upon the mix of sales by country as well as the relative percentage of local sales priced in u.s. dollars versus local currencies. currency neutral sales growth, including acquisitions, was 5% in 2015. we saw good currency neutral sales growth during each quarter of 2015, despite the impact of volume erosion on existing business. we believe that market conditions and the macro-economic environment will continue to be challenging in many markets in 2016. this lower growth environment combined with a stronger u.s. dollar and the reset of the incentive compensation program is expected to pressure our currency neutral operating profit growth and, consequently, we expect currency neutral operating profit growth in 2016 to be mid single-digits, including acquisitions.
33
on a long-term basis, we expect that sales growth for the industry will generally be in line with the underlying assumptions that support our long-term strategic goals, albeit with some risk in the near term given the continuing global economic uncertainty. we believe changing social habits resulting from increased disposable income, improved focus on personal health and wellness awareness should help drive growth of our consumer product customers' businesses.
gross margin increased 60 basis points (bps) year-over-year. included in 2015 was $7.9 million of acquisition-related inventory "step-up" costs and costs associated with operational improvement initiatives, compared to $7.6 million of costs related to accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold and operational improvement initiatives included in 2014. excluding these items, gross margin increased 60 bps compared to the prior year period. the increase was principally driven by productivity initiatives. we ended 2015 in a relatively benign raw material cost environment. we believe that we will continue to see higher prices on certain categories (such as naturals including citrus and vanilla) that will be offset by benefits associated with oil-based derivatives that are expected to continue in 2016. we continue to seek improvements in our margins through operational performance, cost reduction efforts and mix enhancement.
operating profit decreased $4.0 million to $588.3 million (19.5% of sales) in 2015 compared to $592.3 million (19.2% of sales) in 2014. included in 2015 were acquisition related costs of $18.3 million, the reversal of the previously recorded provision for the spanish capital tax case of $10.5 million, accelerated contingent consideration payments of $7.2 million, restructuring and other charges, net of $7.6 million and operational improvement initiative costs of $1.1 million, compared to operational improvement initiative costs of $2.5 million, restructuring and other charges, net of $1.3 million and $5.1 million of accelerated depreciation in 2014. excluding these charges, adjusted operating profit was $612.1 million (20.2% of sales) for 2015 versus $601.3 million (19.5% of sales) for 2014. foreign currency changes had an unfavorable impact on operating profit of approximately 6% in 2015.
cash flows from operations were $433.6 million or 14.3% of sales in 2015 as compared to cash flows from operations of $518.4 million, or 16.8% of sales, during 2014. the decrease in operating cash flows in 2015 as compared to 2014 is principally related to the impact of higher pension contributions, increased core working capital requirements (trade receivables, inventories and accounts payable), and increased requirements related to various operating items (including taxes, employee benefits and prepaids).
our capital spend was $101.0 million (3.3% of sales) during 2015. given our intent to construct a new flavors facility in china, the continuation of our indonesia project and carryover payments from 2015, we expect that capital spending in 2016 will be approximately 5% of sales (net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities).

cost of goods sold includes the cost of materials and manufacturing expenses; raw materials generally constitute 70% of the total. r&d expenses relate to the development of new and improved molecules and technologies, technical product support and compliance with governmental regulations. s&a expenses include expenses necessary to support our commercial activities and administrative expenses principally associated with staff groups that support our overall operating activities.
2015 in comparison to 2014
sales sales for 2015 totaled $3.0 billion, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. excluding currency impacts, sales increased 5%. the currency neutral growth reflects new win performance (net of losses) in both flavors and fragrance compounds partially offset by volume erosion on existing business principally driven by our customers' product line rationalization and inventory management efforts. in addition, our flavors business was negatively impacted by volume erosion in north america (noam) as well as weak demand and lost business in china (principally associated with facility issues). on both a reported and currency neutral basis, the effect of acquisitions was approximately 2% to net sales amounts. in addition, fragrance ingredients sales
35
were up 2% on a currency neutral basis. overall organic currency neutral growth includes 5% growth from emerging markets and 1% from developed markets.
flavors business unit flavors sales in 2015 decreased 1% on a reported basis but increased 6% on a currency neutral basis versus the prior year period. acquisitions accounted for approximately half of the net sales growth on a currency neutral basis. overall growth was primarily due to mid single-digit growth in beverage combined with high single-digit growth in dairy and low single-digit growth in savory. regionally, the flavors business delivered currency neutral growth across all regions, led by la at 16% driven by double-digit gains in beverage, savory and dairy. sales growth in ga of 2% was led by low single-digit gains in savory and dairy, which more than offset low single-digit declines in sweet. sales growth in eame of 4% was driven by mid single-digit gains in savory and beverage. noam sales growth of 11% was primarily driven by high double-digit growth in sweet and dairy and double-digit growth in beverage. eame performance continues to be led by our performance in the emerging market countries within the region. globally, flavors growth was led by mid single-digit growth in emerging markets. overall, emerging markets represented approximately 52% of total flavors sales.
fragrances business unit fragrances sales in 2015 declined 3% on a reported basis and increased 4% on a currency neutral basis. acquisitions accounted for approximately one quarter of the currency neutral sales growth. year-over-year, 2015 currency neutral sales performance was led by double-digit growth in fabric care, high single-digit growth in home care, mid single-digit growth in hair care and low single-digit growth in fragrance ingredients and fine fragrance. currency neutral growth within the regions was led by eame at 7% reflecting double-digit gains in the fabric care and mid single-digit growth in fine fragrance and fragrance ingredients. la experienced currency neutral sales growth of 6% reflecting double-digit gains in fabric care, home care and hair care categories as well as low single-digit gains in fragrance ingredients, which offset mid single-digit declines in fine fragrance. ga had currency neutral sales growth of 3% reflecting high single-digit gains in fragrance ingredients and mid single-digit gains in fabric care. noam currency neutral sales declined 2% reflecting double-digit declines in toiletries, high single-digit declines in fragrance ingredients and mid single-digit declines in fine fragrance which more than offset mid to high single-digit gains in home care and fabric care. overall, emerging markets represented 49% of total fragrances sales.

(1)   currency neutral sales growth is calculated by translating prior year sales at the exchange rates for the corresponding 2015 period.
•   noam flavors sales increased 11%, which included the impact of acquisitions, primarily reflects high double-digit growth in sweet and dairy and double-digit growth in beverage. total fragrances declined 2%, reflecting double-digit declines in toiletries, high single-digit declines in fragrance ingredients and mid single-digit declines in fine fragrance, which more than offset mid single-digit gains in home care and fabric care.
•   eame flavors currency neutral growth of 4% primarily reflects mid single-digit gains in savory and beverage. total fragrances currency neutral growth of 7% was driven by double-digit gains in the fabric care and mid single-digit growth in fine fragrance and fragrance ingredients, which included the impact of acquisitions.
•   la flavors currency neutral sales growth of 16% was driven by double-digit gains in beverage, savory and dairy. total fragrances currency neutral growth of 6% reflects double-digit gains in fabric care, home care and hair care categories as well as low single-digit gains in fragrance ingredients, which offset mid single-digit declines in fine fragrance.

•   ga flavors currency neutral sales growth of 2% was led by low single-digit gains in savory and dairy, which more than offset low single-digit declines in sweet. total fragrances currency neutral growth of 3% primarily reflects high single-digit gains in fragrance ingredients and mid single-digit gains in fabric care.
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold, as a percentage of sales, decreased 60 bps, on a reported and adjusted basis, to 55.3% in 2015 compared to 55.9% in 2014 (or 55.0% and 55.6% on an adjusted basis in 2015 and 2014, respectively). included in cost of goods sold was $7.9 million of acquisition related costs (including $6.8 million of inventory "step-up" costs) and operational improvement initiative costs in 2015 and $7.6 million of charges related to restructuring and operational improvement initiative costs in 2014.
research and development (r&d)
r&d expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased slightly from the prior year period at 8.1% in 2015 compared to 8.2% in 2014. the decrease was principally driven by lower incentive compensation expense in 2015.
selling and administrative (s&a)
s&a, as a percentage of sales, increased 20 bps to 16.9% versus 16.7%. the increase in s&a expenses was principally due to acquisition-related expenses which were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense and the reversal of the previously recorded provision related to the spanish capital tax case of $10.5 million.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges primarily consist of separation costs for employees, including severance, outplacement and other benefit costs.

2015 severance and contingent consideration charges during the fourth quarter of 2015, we established a series of initiatives that are expected to streamline our management structure, simplify decision-making and accountability, better leverage and align our capabilities across the organization and improve efficiency of our global manufacturing and operations network. as a result, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $7.6 million, included in restructuring and other charges, net, related to severance and related costs pertaining to approximately 150 positions that will be affected. the total cost of the plan is expected to be approximately $10 million with the remaining charges relating principally to accelerated depreciation. the company expects to realize pre-tax savings of approximately $7-$9 million once fully implemented in the second half of 2017, half of which is expected to be realized in 2016.
separately, we recorded a charge of $7.2 million, included in selling and administrative expenses, associated with the acceleration from 2016 to 2015 of contingent consideration payments from the aromor acquisition that were triggered by certain of the management structure changes noted above.
fragrance ingredients rationalization - 2014
in 2014, we closed our fragrance ingredients manufacturing facility in augusta, georgia and consolidated production into other company facilities. in connection with this closure, we incurred charges of $13.8 million, consisting primarily of $10.3 million in accelerated depreciation of fixed assets, $2.2 million in personnel-related costs and $1.3 million in plant shutdown and other related costs. we recorded total charges of $7.4 million during 2013, consisting of $2.2 million of pre-tax charges related to severance included in restructuring and other charges, net and $5.2 million of non-cash charges related to accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold. during 2014, we recorded $1.3 million of plant shutdown and other related costs included in restructuring and other charges, net as well as an additional $5.1 million of non-cash charges related to accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold. as a result of this closure, 43 positions have been eliminated. during 2015, we recorded a net credit of $0.5 million principally related to the reversal of severance accruals.

flavors business unit flavors segment profit decreased $12.8 million to $318.5 million in 2015 (22.1% of sales) from $331.3 million (22.7% of sales) in the comparable 2014 period. the decrease in segment profit and profit margin was driven by unfavorable foreign currency impacts, scale up costs of new sites in turkey and indonesia and other one-off costs, including incremental operating costs associated with the china flavors facility. these costs were only partially offset by favorable volume growth, productivity initiatives, sales mix and a slight impact from the addition of ottens flavors.
fragrances business unit fragrances segment profit decreased $13.7 million to $321.8 million in 2015 (20.4% of sales), compared to $335.4 million (20.6% of sales) reported in 2014. the decrease in segment profit and profit margin was principally driven by unfavorable foreign currency impacts, which were partially offset by favorable volume growth, sales mix and a slight impact from the addition of lucas meyer.
global expenses global expenses represent corporate and headquarter-related expenses which include legal, finance, human resources and r&d and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit. in 2015, global expenses were $28.2 million compared to $65.4 million during 2014. the decrease is principally driven by lower incentive compensation expense and the favorable impact of our cash flow hedging program.
interest expense in 2015, interest expense remained comparable with the prior year at $46.1 million. average cost of debt was 4.5% for the 2015 period compared to 4.9% in 2014.
other expense (income), net other expense (income), net decreased approximately $6.0 million to $3.2 million of expense in 2015 versus $2.8 million of income in 2014. this decrease is primarily driven by lower foreign exchange gains on working capital and lower mark-to-market adjustments on deferred compensation plan assets during 2015 compared to the 2014 period.
income taxes the effective tax rate was 22.2% in 2015 as compared to 24.5% in 2014. excluding the $2.6 million tax benefit associated with the pretax restructuring charges and operational improvement initiatives, the $6.2 million benefit associated with acquisition related costs, the $10.5 million tax settlement received in 2015 due to favorable tax rulings in spain and another jurisdiction as well as the $2.9 million charge related to the reversal of the previously recorded provision for the spanish capital tax case, the adjusted tax rate for 2015 was 24.2%. excluding the $2.6 million tax benefit associated with the
38
pretax restructuring charges and operational improvement initiative costs as well as the $3.8 million tax benefit related to the reserve reversal for the 2001 spanish dividend withholding tax case (as discussed in note 10 of the consolidated financial statements), the adjusted tax rate for 2014 was 25.3%. the year-over-year reduction reflects a benefit from lower cost of repatriation and loss provisions which were partially offset by mix of earnings.
2014 in comparison to 2013
sales sales for 2014 totaled $3.1 billion, an increase of 5% from the prior year on both a reported and currency neutral basis, with the acquisition of aromor adding approximately 1% to both reported and currency neutral basis amounts. the currency neutral growth reflected new win performance (net of losses) in both flavors and fragrance compounds partially offset by volume erosion on existing business. in addition, fragrance ingredients sales were up 18% (which includes the benefit of the aromor acquisition). overall currency neutral growth was driven by 6% growth in emerging markets.
flavors business unit in 2014, flavors sales increased 2% on a reported basis and 4% on a currency neutral basis versus 2013. the overall performance reflects new wins offset by volume erosion on existing business. overall high single-digit growth in beverage combined with low single-digit growth in savory and mid single-digit growth in dairy was partially offset by low single-digit declines in sweet. regionally, the flavors business delivered currency neutral growth in la, eame and ga, led by la, while sales declined in noam. sales in la were driven by high double-digit gains in beverage. sales in ga were led by mid single-digit gains in savory and sales in eame were driven by double-digit gains in beverage. the declines in noam were primarily driven by low single-digit declines in beverage and sweet, which were only partially offset by double-digit gains in dairy. eame performance continues to be led by our performance in the emerging market countries within the region. globally, flavors growth was led by high single-digit growth in emerging markets. overall, emerging markets represented approximately 52% of total flavors sales.
fragrances business unit in 2014, the fragrances business was up 7% in both reported and currency neutral terms versus 2013. year-over-year, 2014 currency neutral sales performance was led by double-digit growth in fragrance ingredients, high single-digit growth in fabric care and mid single-digit growth in hair care categories, as well as low single-digit growth in fine fragrances. currency neutral growth within the regions was led by ga at 11% reflecting double-digit gains in the fabric care and fragrance ingredients. eame experienced currency neutral sales growth of 8% reflecting double-digit gains in fragrance ingredients and high single-digit gains in fabric care. la had currency neutral sales growth of 3% reflecting double-digit gains in hair care and personal wash. noam currency neutral sales increased 4% reflecting double-digit gains in home care and mid to high single-digit gains in fabric care and hair care categories that more than offset low single-digit declines in fragrance ingredients. overall, emerging markets represented 47% of total fragrances sales.

_______________________
(1)   currency neutral sales growth is calculated by translating prior year sales at the exchange rates for the corresponding 2014 period.
•   noam reported sales growth of 1% reflecting a decline of 1% in flavors as double-digit growth in dairy was more than offset by volume declines in sweet and beverage, and 4% growth in fragrances. consumer fragrances sales
39
were up 8% versus last year as new wins and volume gains in home care and fabric care were only partially offset by lower volumes on existing business in fragrance ingredients.
•   eame currency neutral growth reflects 4% growth in flavors primarily resulting from double-digit gains in beverages. this growth was mainly due to new wins within our emerging markets in the region, as well as volume increases. total fragrances growth of 8% was driven by double-digit growth in fragrance ingredients as well as high single-digit growth in fabric care.
•   la currency neutral sales growth of 7% was driven by double-digit gains in flavors, driven by beverage. total fragrances growth reflects double-digit gains in hair care and mid single-digit gains in fabric care.
•   ga delivered currency neutral sales growth of 6%, led by mid single-digit gains in savory. both consumer fragrances and fine fragrances experienced high single-digit growth led by double-digit growth in fabric care and high single-digit growth in fine fragrances. in addition, ga experienced fragrance ingredients currency neutral sales growth of 33%.
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold, as a percentage of sales, decreased 60 bps, on both a reported and adjusted basis, to 55.9% in 2014 compared to 56.5% in 2013 (or 55.6% and 56.2% on an adjusted basis in 2014 and 2013, respectively). included in cost of goods sold was $7.6 million of charges related to restructuring and operational improvement initiative costs in 2014 and $8.8 million of restructuring and operational improvement initiative costs in 2013.
research and development (r&d)
r&d expenses decreased approximately $6.2 million versus the prior year. overall, r&d expenses decreased 60 bps as a percentage of sales from 8.8% in 2013 to 8.2% in 2014. this decrease is primarily driven by lower incentive compensation expense.
selling and administrative (s&a)
s&a, as a percentage of sales, decreased 40 bps to 16.7% versus 17.1%. excluding the $13.0 million spanish capital tax charge (as discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements) in 2013, adjusted s&a expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 16.7% in 2013, consistent with the current year.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges primarily consist of separation costs for employees, including severance, outplacement and other benefit costs.

fragrance ingredients rationalization in 2014, we closed our fragrance ingredients manufacturing facility in augusta, georgia and consolidated production into other company facilities. in connection with this closure in 2014, we incurred charges of $13.8 million, consisting primarily of $10.3 million in accelerated depreciation of fixed assets, $2.2 million in personnel-related costs and $1.3 million in plant shutdown and other related costs. we recorded total charges of $7.4 million during 2013, consisting of $2.2 million of pre-tax charges related to severance included in restructuring and other charges, net and $5.2 million of non-cash charges related to accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold. during 2014, we recorded $1.3 million of plant shutdown and other related costs included in restructuring and other charges, net as well as an additional $5.1 million of non-cash charges related to accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold. as a result of this closure, 43 positions were eliminated.
other during 2013, we reversed $1.2 million of employee-related liabilities, offset by $0.6 million of additional costs incurred related to the european rationalization plan announced in 2009. additionally, during 2013, we recorded a charge of $1.7 million related to the strategic initiative, which began in 2011.

flavors business unit flavors segment profit totaled $331.3 million in 2014 (22.7% of sales) consistent with $323.6 million (22.7% of sales) in the comparable 2013 period. the increase in segment profit was driven by lower incentive compensation expense.
fragrances business unit fragrances segment profit totaled $335.4 million in 2014 (20.6% of sales), compared to $283.7 million (18.5% of sales) reported in 2013. the improvement in segment profit and profit margin was primarily due to strong sales growth combined with gross margin expansion, ongoing cost discipline, and lower incentive compensation expense.
global expenses global expenses represent corporate and headquarter-related expenses which include legal, finance, human resources and r&d and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit. in 2014, global expenses were $65.4 million compared to $66.9 million during 2013. the decrease is principally driven by lower incentive compensation expense.
interest expense in 2014, interest expense decreased $0.7 million to $46.1 million, as a result of the refinancing of our debt in 2013. average cost of debt was 4.9% for the 2014 period compared to 4.7% in 2013.
other (income) expense, net other (income) expense, net decreased approximately $12.8 million to $2.8 million of income in 2014 versus $15.6 million of income in 2013. the decrease was largely driven by a $14.2 million gain related to the sale of non-operating assets that occurred during 2013.
income taxes the effective tax rate was 24.5% in 2014 as compared to 27.1% in 2013. excluding the $2.6 million tax benefit associated with the pretax restructuring charges and operational improvement initiative costs as well as the $3.8 million tax benefit related to the reserve reversal for the 2001 spanish dividend withholding tax case (as discussed in note 10 of the consolidated financial statements), the adjusted tax rate for 2014 was 25.3%. excluding the tax charge of $6.2 million related to the 2002-2003 income tax cases (as discussed in note 10 of the consolidated financial statements) and net of the $3.9 million tax benefit associated with the pretax spanish capital tax charge (as discussed in note 18 of the consolidated financial statements), the adjusted tax rate for 2013 was 25.7%. the year-over-year reduction reflects a benefit from mix of earnings and lower loss provisions partially offset by a higher cost of repatriation.

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents we had cash and cash equivalents of $182.0 million at december 31, 2015 compared to $478.6 million at december 31, 2014, of which $130.1 million of the balance at december 31, 2015 was held outside the united states. cash balances held in foreign jurisdictions are, in most circumstances, available to be repatriated to the united states; however, they would be subject to united states federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. we have not provided u.s. income tax expense on substantially all of the accumulated undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we have the ability and plan to reinvest these indefinitely.
effective utilization of the cash generated by our international operations is a critical component of our tax strategy. strategic dividend repatriation from foreign subsidiaries creates u.s. taxable income, which enables us to realize u.s. deferred tax assets. we regularly repatriate, in the form of dividends from our non-u.s. subsidiaries, a portion of our current year earnings to fund financial obligations in the u.s. these repatriations of current year earnings totaled $184.6 million, $248.0 million and $128.0 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
cash flows from operating activities operating cash flows in 2015 were $433.6 million compared to $518.4 million in 2014 and $407.6 million in 2013. the decrease in operating cash flows in 2015 as compared to 2014 is principally related to the impact of higher pension contributions, increased core working capital requirements and increased requirements related to various operating items (including taxes, employee benefits and prepaids). included in 2014 was payment of $11.2 million to the spanish government related to a capital tax case and included in 2013 was $48 million of cash payments related to the spanish tax cases.
working capital (current assets less current liabilities) totaled $713.8 million at year-end 2015 compared to $1,191.2 million at december 31, 2014. this decrease in working capital of $477.4 million primarily reflects a decrease in cash balances principally resulting from the acquisitions of ottens flavors and lucas meyer during 2015 as well as higher payable balances. we sold certain accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under "factoring" agreements that are sponsored, solely and individually, by certain customers. we believe that participating in the factoring programs strengthens our relationships with these customers and provides operational efficiencies. we estimate that, as a result of participating in the programs, there was a beneficial impact to cash inflows from operations of approximately $3.4 million, $33.1 million and $6.5 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods.
cash flows used in investing activities net investing activities in 2015 utilized $577.2 million compared to $221.3 million and $105.4 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increase in cash paid for investing activities is primarily driven by the acquisitions of ottens flavors and lucas meyer during 2015. we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of ottens flavors and lucas meyer for approximately $188.5 million (net of cash acquired) and $304.9 million (net of cash acquired), respectively.
additions to property, plant and equipment were $101.0 million, $143.2 million and $134.2 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively (net of grants and other reimbursements from government authorities). these investments largely arise from our ongoing focus to align our manufacturing facilities with our customer demand, primarily in emerging markets and new technology consistent with our strategy, but also reflect approximately $6.5 million in odor-abatement equipment which was invested to address environmental issues at one of our flavors facilities in china.
in light of our intent to construct a new flavors facility in china, our relocation of our ingredients facility in hangzhou, china and the continuation of our indonesia project we expect that capital spending in 2016 will be approximately 5% of sales (net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities).
cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities net financing activities in 2015 had an outflow of $131.3 million compared to an outflow of $202.3 million and an outflow of $217.0 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the decrease in outflow of cash used in financing activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 principally reflects higher incremental dividend payments and treasury share repurchases in 2015 which were more than offset by proceeds from the drawdown on the revolving credit facility during 2015. the decrease in outflow of cash used in financing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 principally reflects higher incremental dividend payments and treasury share repurchases in 2014 which were more than offset by the repayment of long-term debt of $100 million made in 2013.
42
at december 31, 2015, we had $1,070.2 million of debt outstanding compared to $942.3 million outstanding at december 31, 2014.
we paid dividends totaling $158.9 million, $133.2 million and $87.3 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the cash dividend declared per share in 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $2.06, $1.72 and $1.46, respectively.
in december 2012, the board of directors authorized a $250 million share repurchase program, which commenced in the first quarter of 2013. in august 2015, the board of directors approved an additional $250 million share repurchase authorization and extension through december 31, 2017. based on the total remaining amount of $237 million available under the repurchase program, approximately 2.0 million shares, or 2.5% of shares outstanding (based on the market price and shares outstanding as of december 31, 2015) could be repurchased under the program as of december 31, 2015. the purchases will be made from time to time on the open market or through private transactions as market and business conditions warrant. repurchased shares will be placed into treasury stock. the ultimate level of purchases will be a function of the daily purchase limits established in the pre-approved program according to the share price at that time.
capital resources operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for capital investment needs, dividends paid to shareholders and debt repayments. we anticipate that cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facilities are sufficient to meet our investing and financing needs for at least the next eighteen months. we regularly assess our capital structure, including both current and long-term debt instruments, as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility and to optimize our leverage ratios. based on our leverage ratios and general market interest rate expectations, we anticipate evaluating refinancing opportunities during 2016. we believe our existing cash balances are sufficient to meet our debt service requirements.
during the third quarter of 2015, we acquired lucas meyer for approximately $304.9 million (net of cash acquired), which was funded from existing resources.
during the second quarter of 2015, we acquired ottens flavors for approximately $188.5 million (net of cash acquired), which was funded from existing resources.
credit facility and senior notes we supplement short-term liquidity with access to capital markets, mainly through bank credit facilities and issuance of commercial paper. we did not issue commercial paper during 2015 and 2014.
credit facility there are two tranches under the credit facility. the tranche a facility is available in u.s. dollars, euros, swiss francs, japanese yen and british sterling in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of $456.0 million, with a sublimit of $25.0 million for swing line borrowings. the tranche b facility is available in euros, swiss francs, japanese yen and british sterling in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of $494.0 million. the credit facility is available for general corporate purposes. borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at an annual rate of libor plus a margin, currently 112.5 bps, linked to our credit rating. the interest rate under our credit facility at december 31, 2015 was 1.13%. the credit facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants, including the requirement for us to maintain, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted ebitda in respect of the previous 12-month period of not more than 3.25 to 1. based on this ratio, at december 31, 2015 our covenant compliance would provide overall borrowing capacity of $1,429.3 million.
as of december 31, 2015 we had $131.2 million borrowings under the credit facility. the amount which we are able to draw down on under the credit facility is limited by financial covenants as described in more detail below. our drawdown capacity on the credit facility was $790.7 million at december 31, 2015. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the credit facility.
at december 31, 2015 and 2014 we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants, including the net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio. at december 31, 2015 our net debt/adjusted ebitda(1) ratio was 1.24 to 1 as defined by the credit facility, well below the financial covenants of existing outstanding debt. failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements would constitute default and would allow the lenders to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreement. if such acceleration were to occur, we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness. we would likely have to seek amendments under the agreements for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity, and/or asset sales, if necessary. we may be unable to amend the agreements or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated.

senior notes senior notes - 2013. in april 2013, we issued $300.0 million face amount of 3.20% senior notes ("senior notes - 2013") due 2023 at a discount of $0.3 million, to take advantage of attractive borrowing rates and maintain efficiency and flexibility in our capital structure, and received proceeds of $297.8 million. the senior notes -2013 bear interest at a rate of 3.20% per year, with interest payable on may 1 and november 1 of each year, commencing on november 1, 2013. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the senior notes - 2013.
senior notes - 2007. in september 2007, we issued an aggregate of $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes in four series, with $250.0 million due in 2017, $100.0 million due in 2019, $50 million due in 2022 and $100.0 million due in 2027. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the senior notes - 2007.
senior notes - 2006. in 2006, we issued an aggregate of $375.0 million of senior unsecured notes in four series, of which $250.0 million has been repaid, and the remaining $125.0 million is due in 2016. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the senior notes - 2006.
other commitments compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our operations, earnings or competitive position. in 2015 and 2014, we spent $9.3 million and $4.3 million on capital projects and $19.0 million and $19.2 million, respectively, in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such regulations. expenditures for these purposes will continue for the foreseeable future. in addition, we are party to a number of proceedings brought under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act or similar state statutes. it is expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will not be material to our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

the table above does not include $24.2 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately $0.8 million of associated accrued interest. due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which the remaining liabilities might be paid.
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. as disclosed in note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures. these estimates are based on management's best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future. actual results may ultimately differ from estimates.
those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve:
the periodic assessment of potential impairment of goodwill. we currently have goodwill of $941.4 million. in assessing the potential for impairment of goodwill, management uses the most current actual and forecasted operating data available and current market based assumptions in accordance with the criteria in asc 350. the company has identified four reporting units: (1) flavors, (2) fragrance compounds (3) fragrance ingredients and (4) cosmetic active ingredients.
the company performed the annual goodwill impairment test, utilizing the two-step approach for the flavors, fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients reporting units, by assessing the fair value of our reporting units based on discounted cash flows. we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30, 2015, which indicated no impairment of goodwill, as the estimated fair values substantially exceeded the carrying values of each of these reporting units. given the recent date of the acquisition of lucas meyer, we utilized the qualitative approach for the cosmetic active ingredients reporting unit, which indicated no impairment of goodwill.
the analysis and evaluation of income taxes. we account for taxes under the asset and liability method. under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities. a valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than
45
not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future earnings, reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. if actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions, the recorded deferred tax asset may not be fully realized resulting in an increase to income tax expense in our results of operations.
the company has not established deferred tax liabilities for substantially all undistributed foreign earnings as it has plans to and intends to indefinitely reinvest those earnings to finance foreign activities. the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings approximates $233.6 million.
we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. we first determine whether it is "more likely than not" that we would sustain our tax position if the relevant tax authority were to audit the position with full knowledge of all the relevant facts and other information. for those tax positions that meet this threshold, we measure the amount of tax benefit based on the largest amount of tax benefit that we have a greater than 50% chance of realizing in a final settlement with the relevant authority. those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard. this evaluation is made at the time that we adopt a tax position and whenever there is new information and is based upon management's evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. we maintain a cumulative risk portfolio relating to all of our uncertainties in income taxes in order to perform this analysis, but the evaluation of our tax positions requires significant judgment and estimation in part because, in certain cases, tax law is subject to varied interpretation, and whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain. we do not currently believe that any of our pending tax assessments, even if ultimately resolved against us, would have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows.
the evaluation of potential litigation and environmental liabilities, where changing circumstances, rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs. we are subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters, as well as environmental-related matters. significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably estimated.
we regularly assess potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information, in consultation with outside counsel we have engaged on our behalf to handle the defense of such matters. to the extent a liability is considered to be probable and reasonably estimable, we recognize a corresponding liability; if the reasonably estimated liability is a range, we recognize that amount considered most likely, or in the absence of such a determination, the minimum reasonably estimated liability. to the extent such claims are covered by various insurance policies, we separately evaluate the right to recovery and estimate the related insurance claim receivable. management judgments involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred, the reasonably estimated amount of that liability, and any potential insurance recovery.
we regularly evaluate potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and the viability of other potentially responsible parties ("prp's") associated with our exposure. recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available. critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of prp's to share such costs.
determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations. amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations. inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets, discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled, rates of increase in future compensation levels, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates. these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. in accordance with gaap, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods.
we consider a number of factors in determining and selecting assumptions for the overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. we consider the historical long-term return experience of our assets, the current and expected allocation of our plan assets, and expected long-term rates of return. we derive these expected long-term rates of return with the assistance of our investment advisors. we base our expected allocation of plan assets on a diversified portfolio consisting of domestic and international equity securities, fixed income, real estate, and alternative asset classes.
we consider a variety of factors in determining and selecting our assumptions for the discount rate at december 31. for the u.s. plans, the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of moody's aaa, aa and merrill lynch aaa-aa high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan. the rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable u.s. plans are based on plan experience.
with respect to the u.s. plans, the expected rate of return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current target allocation, real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate. the target asset
46
allocation consists of approximately: 40% in equity securities and 60% in fixed income securities. the plan has achieved a compounded annual rate of return of 6.9% over the previous 20 years. at december 31, 2015, the actual asset allocation was: 41% in equity securities; 58% in fixed income securities; and 1% in cash equivalents.
the expected rate of return for the non-u.s. plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments, inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements. the target asset allocation, for the non-u.s. plans, consists of approximately: 40% - 70% in fixed income securities; 15% - 40% in equity securities; 5% - 20% in real estate; and 5% - 10% in alternative investments. at december 31, 2015, the actual asset allocation was: 55% in fixed income investments; 27% in equity investments; 7% in real estate investments; 9% in alternative investments and 2% in cash and cash equivalents.
changes in pension and other post-employment benefits, and associated expenses, may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. the impact that a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate or a 1% change in the medical cost trend rate would have on our pension and other post-employment benefit expense, as applicable, is as follows:

the ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory, given the large number of natural ingredients employed, the quality of which may be diminished over time. we hold a majority of our inventory as raw materials, providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use. as of december 31, 2015, we maintained 48% of our inventory as raw materials. materials are evaluated based on shelf life, known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in product/sales mix. management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete.
we believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to, and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the impact of these items in our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows for the years presented. we have discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors.
new accounting standards in february 2016, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued authoritative guidance which requires changes to the accounting for leases. the new guidance establishes a new lease accounting model, that, for many companies, eliminates the concept of operating leases and requires entities to record assets and liabilities related to leases on the balance sheet for certain types of leases. the guidance will be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 31, 2018. early adoption will be permitted for all entities. the company is currently evaluating the impact that this new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.
in november 2015, the fasb issued authoritative guidance which requires entities to present all deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. early adoption of this guidance is permitted. the company elected to adopt this guidance as of december 31, 2015 and accordingly has classified all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2015. this guidance has been applied prospectively and prior amounts have not been adjusted retrospectively.
in september 2015, the fasb issued authoritative guidance relating to the adjustments made during the measurement period for items in a business combination. specifically, the new guidance would require adjustments related to the finalization of estimates to be recorded in the period when they are determined and to provide certain additional disclosures. this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. the company has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

in july 2015, the fasb issued authoritative guidance relating to the measurement of inventory costs, which more closely aligns the measurement of inventory in generally accepted accounting principles with the measurement of inventory in international financial reporting standards. this guidance is effective for years beginning after december 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. the company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
in may 2014, the fasb issued authoritative guidance to clarify the principles to be used to recognize revenue and, in august 2015, issued authoritative guidance delaying the effective adoption date of that guidance by one year. the guidance is applicable to all entities and, based on the revised adoption date, is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2017. adoption as of the original effective date is permitted. the company is currently evaluating the impact that this new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.
in april 2015, the fasb issued authoritative guidance which provides a practical expedient related to the measurement date of defined benefit plan assets and obligations. this guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2015. the company adopted this guidance as of december 31, 2015 and it did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
in april 2015, the fasb issued authoritative guidance which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. this guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2015. the company has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
in february 2015, the fasb issued authoritative guidance related to accounting for the consolidation of certain legal entities. the guidance will change the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine the criteria for consolidating certain types of entities. this guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2015. the company has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
non-gaap financial measures the company uses non-gaap financial operating measures in this annual report, including: (i) currency neutral sales (which eliminates the effects that result from translating its international sales in u.s. dollars), (ii)  adjusted operating profit and operating profit margin (which excludes the acquisition related costs, reversal of the previously recorded provision for the spanish capital tax case, operational improvement initiative and restructuring charges) and (iii) adjusted effective tax rate (which excludes the sale of a non-operating assets, tax and litigation settlements, restructuring charges, acquisition related costs, reversal of the previously recorded provision for the spanish capital tax case and operational improvement initiative costs). the company also provides the non-gaap measures adjusted ebitda (which excludes certain specified items and non-cash items as set forth in the company's debt agreements) and net debt (which is adjusted for deferred gain on interest rate swaps and cash and cash equivalents) solely for the purpose of providing information regarding the company's compliance with debt covenants contained in its debt agreements.
we have included each of these non-gaap measures in order to provide additional information regarding our underlying operating results and comparable year-over-year performance. such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with gaap and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with gaap. in discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition, we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of, on a period-to-period comparable basis, financial amounts both including and excluding these identified items, as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, on operating results and financial condition. we believe such additional non-gaap information provides investors with an overall perspective of the period-to-period performance of our business. in addition, management internally reviews each of these non-gaap measures to evaluate performance on a comparative period-to-period basis in terms of absolute performance, trends and expected future performance with respect to our business. a material limitation of these non-gaap measures is that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts; for example, costs associated with operational improvements and restructuring activities involve actual cash outlays. we compensate for such limitations by using these measures as one of several metrics, including gaap measures. these non-gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations organization of information the following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our business through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to those financial statements. our md&a is presented in the following sections:
•   executive summary and financial highlights
•   2016 outlook
•   results of operations
•   comprehensive income
•   operating segment results
•   liquidity and capital resources
•   contractual obligations and other commercial commitments
•   application of critical accounting estimates
•   recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements executive summary and financial highlights we are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines and engine-related component products, including filtration, aftertreatment, turbochargers, fuel systems, controls systems, air handling systems and electric power generation systems. we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (oems), distributors and other customers worldwide. we have long-standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve, including paccar inc, daimler trucks north america, navistar international corporation, fiat chrysler automobiles (fiat chrysler), volvo ab, komatsu and man nutzfahrzeuge ag. we serve our customers through a network of approximately 600 company-owned and independent distributor locations and over 7,200 dealer locations in more than 190 countries and territories.
our reportable operating segments consist of the following: engine, distribution, components and power generation. this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves. the engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various industrial markets. our engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as in various industrial applications, including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military equipment. the distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various oems throughout the world. the components segment sells filtration products, aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. the power generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems, which sells engines, generator sets and alternators.
our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on-highway, construction and general industrial markets. demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions. our sales may also be impacted by oem inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages. economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reduced sales of our products and can result in price reductions in certain products and/or markets. as a worldwide business, our operations are also affected by currency, political, economic and regulatory matters, including adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards, in the countries we serve. as part of our growth strategy, we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of these risks such as china, brazil, india, mexico, russia and countries in the middle east and africa. at the same time, our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results.
worldwide revenues declined 1 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, lower global demand in most industrial markets and lower on-highway demand in international markets, especially in brazil, mostly offset by the consolidation of our partially-owned north american distributors since december 31, 2013 and higher demand in north american on-highway markets. continued international economic weakness in 2015 negatively impacted our

international revenues, which declined by 11 percent with sales down in most of our markets, especially in brazil and europe as a result of their challenging economic conditions and slower growth in china. the decline in international sales was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts of 4 percent (primarily in the euro, brazilian real, australian dollar, canadian dollar, british pound and indian rupee), declines in international industrial markets led by declines in the commercial marine market and the construction market (primarily in europe) and lower demand in on-highway markets (primarily in brazil and china). revenue in the u.s. and canada improved by 7 percent primarily due to increased distribution segment sales related to the consolidation of north american distributors and higher demand in north american on-highway markets, partially offset by lower demand in construction and mining markets.
the following table contains sales and earnings before interest expense, income tax expense and noncontrolling interests (ebit) results by operating segment for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014. refer to the section titled "operating segment results" for a more detailed discussion of net sales and ebit by operating segment including the reconciliation of segment ebit to income before income taxes.

(1) the year ended december 31, 2015, included an impairment of light-duty diesel assets for the engine and components segments of $202 million and $9 million, respectively.
(2) the year ended december 31, 2015, included $90 million of restructuring actions and other charges. restructuring actions and other charges for the engine, distribution, components, power generation and non-segment segments were $26 million, $23 million, $13 million, $19 million and $9 million, respectively. see results of operations for additional information.
(3) the year ended december 31, 2015, included a $60 million accrual for a loss contingency. see note 14, "commitments and contingencies," to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
net income attributable to cummins inc. for 2015 was $1,399 million, or $7.84 per diluted share, on sales of $19.1 billion, compared to 2014 net income attributable to cummins inc. of $1,651 million, or $9.02 per diluted share, on sales of $19.2 billion. the decrease in net income and earnings per share was driven by our impairment of light-duty diesel assets, unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, restructuring actions, loss contingency, lower other income as a result of larger gains recognized in 2014 from the acquisition of north american distributors and lower equity, royalty and interest income from investees. these decreases were partially offset by improved gross margin, lower research, development and engineering expenses and a lower effective tax rate of 27.4 percent in 2015 versus 28.7 percent in 2014. the increase in gross margin was primarily due to improved distribution segment sales from the consolidation of partially-owned north american distributors since december 31, 2013 and lower material and commodity costs, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations (primarily in the australian dollar, canadian dollar, brazilian real and euro), unfavorable pricing, unfavorable mix and lower volumes. diluted earnings per share for 2015 benefited $0.14 per share from lower shares outstanding, primarily due to purchases under the stock repurchase program.
we generated $2.1 billion of operating cash flows in 2015, compared to $2.3 billion in 2014. refer to the section titled "cash flows" in the "liquidity and capital resources" section for a discussion of items impacting cash flows.
during 2015, we repurchased $900 million of common stock under our authorized repurchase plans. in november 2015, our board of directors authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of additional common stock upon the completion of the 2014 repurchase plan.
during 2015, we paid $120 million to acquire the remaining interest in three north american distributors, including the related debt retirements, and recognized a total gain of $18 million on the fair value adjustment resulting from the acquisition of the controlling interests in two of these previously unconsolidated entities. we plan to spend an additional $85 million to $110 million on north american distributor acquisitions and the related debt retirements in 2016. refer to note 20, "acquisitions," to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

on november 13, 2015, we entered into an amended and restated five-year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders. the credit agreement provides us with a $1.75 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, the proceeds of which are to be used for working capital or other general corporate purposes.
our debt to capital ratio (total capital defined as debt plus equity) at december 31, 2015, was 17.5 percent, compared to 17.2 percent at december 31, 2014. at december 31, 2015, we had $1.8 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand and access to our credit facilities, if necessary, to meet currently anticipated investment and funding needs. as of the date of filing this annual report on form 10-k, our credit ratings were as follows:

in july 2015, our board of directors authorized an increase to our quarterly dividend of 25 percent from $0.78 per share to $0.975 per share.
our global pension plans, including our unfunded and non-qualified plans, were 111 percent funded at december 31, 2015. our u.s. qualified plan, which represents approximately 57 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 119 percent funded and our u.k. plan was 123 percent funded. we expect to contribute approximately $150 million to our global pension plans in 2016. refer to application of critical accounting estimates within md&a and note 10, "pension and other postretirement benefits," to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information concerning our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.
in the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded an impairment charge of $211 million related to our light-duty diesel manufacturing assets ($202 million in our engine segment and $9 million in our components segment) to adjust the assets to their fair value of $35 million ($33 million for the engine segment and $2 million for the components segment). see note 3, "impairment of light-duty diesel assets," to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information.
in the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated a reduction in our worldwide work force of approximately 1,900 employees in response to lower demand for our products in the u.s. and key markets around the world. the employee reductions occurred across all parts of the company. we incurred a fourth quarter charge of $90 million ($61 million after-tax) for the headcount reductions, of which $86 million will be settled in cash and an additional $4 million for impairment and other related charges. we will continue to evaluate our manufacturing facilities and make adjustments as necessary to align with changing demand and drive efficiencies in our business. see note 4, "restructuring actions and other charges," to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information.
in the fourth quarter of 2015, we incurred a loss contingency of $60 million in other operating expense, net in our consolidated statements of income. see note 14, "commitments and contingencies," to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information. this charge was included in our engine segment results.
on february 9, 2016, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (asr) agreement with goldman, sachs & co. to purchase $500 million of our common stock. this asr agreement is part of our previously announced share repurchase plans authorized by the board of directors. pursuant to the terms of the agreement, there will be an initial delivery of approximately 4 million shares. the final number of shares to be repurchased will be based on our volume-weighted average stock price during the terms of the transaction, less a discount. the asr is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2016.

2016 outlook near-term our outlook reflects the following positive trends in 2016:
•   we expect demand in the north american medium-duty truck market to remain strong.
•   we expect demand for pick-up trucks in north america to remain strong.
•   we expect demand in india to improve in some end-markets as its economy continues to improve.
•   we expect to realize annualized savings from the restructuring actions of approximately $160 million.
our outlook reflects the following challenges to our business that may reduce our revenue and earnings potential in 2016:
•   we may close or restructure additional manufacturing facilities as we evaluate the appropriate size and structure of our manufacturing capacity, which could result in additional charges.
•   we expect industry production of heavy-duty trucks in north america to decline.
•   we expect power generation markets to remain weak.
•   weak economic conditions in brazil will continue to negatively impact demand across our businesses.
•   we anticipate end-markets in china to remain weak.
•   foreign currency volatility could continue to put pressure on our revenues and earnings.
•   we expect market demand to remain weak in the oil and gas markets as the result of low crude oil prices.
•   demand for equipment in global mining markets is expected to remain weak and could continue to decline if commodity prices continue to weaken.

2015 vs. 2014
net sales net sales decreased $111 million versus 2014, primarily driven by the following:
•   foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales approximately 4 percent (primarily in the euro, brazilian real, australian dollar, canadian dollar, british pound and indian rupee).
•   engine segment sales decreased 5 percent, primarily due to lower global demand in most industrial markets and lower on-highway demand in international markets, especially brazil, partially offset by higher demand in most north american on-highway markets.
•   power generation segment sales decreased 5 percent, due to lower demand in all lines of business and across most markets.
the decreases above were partially offset by the following:
•   distribution segment sales increased 20 percent, principally related to the acquisitions of north american distributors since december 31, 2013.
34
•   components segment sales increased 1 percent, primarily due to higher demand in the emission solutions and fuel systems businesses, partially offset by lower demand in the turbo technologies and filtration businesses.
sales to international markets (excluding the u.s. and canada), based on location of customers, were 39 percent of total net sales in 2015, compared with 44 percent of total net sales in 2014.
a more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the "operating segment results" section.
gross margin gross margin increased $86 million and 0.6 points as a percentage of sales, primarily due to improved distribution segment sales from the consolidation of partially-owned north american distributors since december 31, 2013 and lower material and commodity costs, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations (primarily in the australian dollar, canadian dollar, brazilian real and euro), unfavorable pricing, unfavorable mix and lower volumes.
the provision for warranties issued, excluding campaigns, as a percentage of sales was 1.8 percent in 2015 and 2.0 percent in 2014. a more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the "operating segment results" section.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $3 million, primarily due to lower consulting expenses of $41 million, partially offset by higher compensation and related expenses of $19 million (largely due to the acquisition of partially-owned north american distributors since december 31, 2013). compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. overall, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, was 10.9 percent in 2015 and 2014.
research, development and engineering expenses research, development and engineering expenses decreased $19 million, primarily due to higher expense recovery of $12 million, partially offset by higher consulting expenses of $8 million. overall, research, development and engineering expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 3.8 percent in 2015 from 3.9 percent in 2014. research activities continue to focus on development of new products to meet future emission standards around the world and improvements in fuel economy performance.
equity, royalty and interest income from investees equity, royalty and interest income from investees decreased $55 million, primarily due to the consolidation of partially-owned north american distributors since december 31, 2013, of $74 million, lower earnings at dongfeng cummins engine company, ltd. of $16 million and chongqing cummins engine company, ltd. of $10 million. these decreases were partially offset by higher earnings at beijing foton cummins engine co., ltd. of $64 million as it continues to increase market share with the new heavy-duty engine platform introduced in 2014.
impairment of light-duty diesel assets we began development of a new north american light-duty diesel engine (ldd) platform in july of 2006 for use in a variety of on- and off-highway applications. since that time, and as of december 31, 2015, we capitalized investments of approximately $279 million, with a net book value prior to the impairment of $246 million ($235 million of which is in our engine segment and $11 million of which is in our components segment). market uncertainty due to the global recession in 2008/2009 resulted in some customers delaying or canceling their vehicle programs, while others remained active. we announced an agreement with nissan motor co. ltd. in 2013 to supply our light-duty diesel engine and began commercial shipment in 2015. in the fourth quarter of 2015, we learned that we were not successful in our bid to supply this product for an additional customer. in addition, the recent deterioration in global economic conditions and excess manufacturing capacity in other markets make it unlikely that we will manufacture additional products on the ldd line to utilize its excess capacity during the asset recovery period. as a result, we concluded that the combination of these events presented a triggering event requiring an assessment of the recoverability of these assets in the fourth quarter of 2015. the assessment indicated that the projected undiscounted cash flows related to this asset group were not sufficient to recover its carrying value. consequently, we were required to write down the ldd asset group to fair value. our fourth quarter results included an impairment charge of $211 million ($133 million after-tax), of which $202 million is in the engine segment and $9 million is in the components segment, to reflect the assets at fair value. we remain committed to servicing existing contracts and are not exiting this product line.
the fair value of the asset group was estimated to be $35 million ($33 million for the engine segment and $2 million for the components segment) and was calculated primarily using a cost approach with consideration of a market approach where
35
secondary market information was available for the type and age of these assets. in the application of the market approach, we determined that the liquidation value in-place reflected the best estimate of fair value. in the application of the cost approach we considered the current cost of replacing the assets with a reduction for physical deterioration given the age of the assets and a reduction for functional and economic obsolescence in the form of a discount reflecting the current and projected under-utilization of the assets. the fair value of these assets are considered level 3 under the fair value hierarchy as they are either derived from unobservable inputs or have significant adjustments to the observable inputs.
restructuring actions and other charges in the fourth quarter of 2015, we announced and executed restructuring actions primarily in the form of professional voluntary and involuntary employee separation programs in response to the continued deterioration in our global markets in the second half of 2015, as well as expected reductions in orders in most u.s. and global markets in 2016. we reduced our worldwide workforce by approximately 1,900 employees, including approximately 370 employees accepting voluntary retirement packages with the remainder of the reductions being involuntary. we incurred a charge of $90 million ($61 million after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2015, which included $86 million for the severance costs related to both voluntary and involuntary terminations and $4 million for asset impairments and other charges.
employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan. estimates of restructuring costs and benefits were made based on information available at the time charges were recorded. due to the inherent uncertainty involved, actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded and we may need to revise previous estimates.
restructuring actions during 2015 included:
in millions                                    year ended december 31, 2015
workforce reductions                                        $86
impairments and other charges                                 4
restructuring actions and other charges                     $90
we expect to realize annualized savings from the restructuring actions of approximately $160 million. approximately 40 percent of the savings from our restructuring actions will be realized in cost of sales, 40 percent in selling, general and administrative expenses and 20 percent in research, development and engineering expenses. we expect the severance to be paid in cash which will be funded from operations.
at december 31, 2015, approximately 1,700 of the 1,900 employees affected by this plan were terminated. we expect to complete the substantial majority of this program by april of 2016.
restructuring actions and other charges were included in each segment in our operating results as follows:

income tax expense our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent u.s. statutory income tax rate, primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits. our effective tax rate for 2015 was 27.4 percent compared to 28.7 percent for 2014. the 1.3 percent decrease in our effective tax rate from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions related to a favorable audit settlement and favorable changes in the jurisdictional mix of pre-tax income.
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. at december 31, 2015, we recorded net deferred tax assets of $356 million. these assets included $236 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards. a valuation allowance of $209 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized. in the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets.
we expect our 2016 effective tax rate to be 28.5 percent, excluding any discrete items that may arise.
noncontrolling interests noncontrolling interests eliminate the income or loss attributable to non-cummins ownership interests in our consolidated entities. noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries decreased $14 million, primarily due to lower earnings

at wuxi cummins turbo technologies co. ltd. and a decline from the acquisition of the remaining interest in previously consolidated north american distributors since december 31, 2013.
net income attributable to cummins inc. and diluted earnings per common share attributable to cummins inc.
net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to cummins inc. decreased $252 million and $1.18 per share primarily due to our impairment of light-duty diesel assets, unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, restructuring actions, loss contingency, lower other income as a result of larger gains recognized in 2014 from the acquisition of north american distributors and lower equity, royalty and interest income from investees. these decreases were partially offset by improved gross margin, lower research, development and engineering expenses and a lower effective tax rate of 27.4 percent in 2015 versus 28.7 percent in 2014. diluted earnings per share for 2015 benefited $0.14 per share from lower shares outstanding, primarily due to purchases under the stock repurchase program.
2014 vs. 2013
net sales net sales increased $1,920 million versus 2013, primarily driven by the following:
•   distribution segment sales increased 38 percent, primarily due to the acquisitions of north american distributors.
•   engine segment sales increased 9 percent due to higher demand in the north american on-highway markets.
•   components segment sales increased 18 percent, primarily due to higher demand in on-highway markets in north america, europe and china.
the increases were partially offset by the following:
•   power generation segment sales decreased 4 percent, mainly due to lower volumes within power products, alternators and power systems.
•   foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales approximately 1 percent (primarily the brazilian real and indian rupee).
sales to international markets (excluding the u.s. and canada), based on location of customers, were 44 percent of total net sales in 2014, compared with 48 percent of total net sales in 2013.

income tax expense our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent u.s. statutory income tax rate, primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits. our effective tax rate for 2014 was 28.7 percent compared to 25.1 percent for 2013. the 3.6 percent increase in the effective tax rate from 2013 to 2014 is partially due to a 1.2 percent net tax benefit for one-time items in 2013 that did not repeat in 2014. these 2013 one-time items consisted primarily of the 2012 federal research tax credit that was reinstated during 2013. the additional 2.4 percent increase in tax rate from 2013 to 2014 is attributable primarily to the following unfavorable items that occurred in 2014: a tax law change in the u.k. resulting in a higher limitation on the deductibility of interest; unfavorable changes in the jurisdictional mix of pretax income; and increases in state valuation allowances.
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. at december 31, 2014, we
39
recorded net deferred tax assets of $184 million. these assets included $190 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards. a valuation allowance of $144 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized.
noncontrolling interests noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries decreased $20 million, primarily due to a $23 million decline from the acquisition of the remaining interest in previously consolidated north american distributors since december 31, 2012.
net income attributable to cummins inc. and diluted earnings per common share attributable to cummins inc.
net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to cummins inc. increased $168 million and $1.11 per share primarily due to higher gross margin, mainly driven by improved volumes and higher distribution segment sales related to the consolidation of partially-owned north american distributors since december 31, 2012. these increases were partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and a higher effective tax rate of 28.7 percent in 2014 versus 25.1 percent in 2013. diluted earnings per share for 2014 benefited $0.16 per share from lower shares outstanding, primarily due to purchases under the stock repurchase program.

2015 vs. 2014
sales engine segment sales decreased $513 million versus 2014. the following were the primary drivers by market:
•   industrial engine sales decreased in all north american markets and most international markets driven by lower global demand in construction markets with decreased engine shipments of 27 percent, primarily in north america, europe and china and reduced demand in global commercial marine markets with decreased engine shipments of 16 percent.
•   foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales results (primarily the brazilian real, euro and british pound).
•   light-duty automotive sales decreased due to lower demand, primarily in brazil.
the decreases above were partially offset by the following:
•   medium-duty truck and bus sales increased due to higher demand in the north american medium-duty truck market with increased engine shipments of 14 percent and higher global bus demand with improved engine shipments of 10 percent. these increases were partially offset by weaker medium-duty truck demand in brazil.
•   heavy-duty truck engine sales increased due to improved demand in the north american heavy-duty truck market, partially offset by weaker demand in china and korea.
total on-highway-related sales for 2015 were 68 percent of total engine segment sales, compared to 65 percent in 2014.
segment ebit in the fourth quarter of 2015, we incurred an impairment charge of $202 million for our light-duty diesel assets and took a $60 million charge for a loss contingency. we also incurred a restructuring charge of $26 million for actions primarily in the form of professional voluntary and involuntary employee separation programs in response to the continued deterioration in our global markets in the second half of 2015, as well as expected reductions in orders in most u.s. and global markets in 2016.

engine segment ebit decreased $418 million versus 2014, primarily due to lower gross margin, an impairment of light-duty diesel assets, an accrual for a loss contingency and restructuring actions and other charges, partially offset by favorable foreign currency fluctuations (primarily the euro, british pound and mexican peso), lower selling, general and administrative expenses, higher equity, royalty and interest income from investees and lower research, development and engineering expenses. major components of ebit and related changes to segment ebit and ebit as a percentage of sales were as follows:

the decrease in gross margin versus 2014 was primarily due to lower volumes and unfavorable mix, partially offset by lower material and commodity costs and favorable foreign currency fluctuations. the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower consulting expenses and lower compensation expenses. the decrease in research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to higher expense recovery from customers. the increase in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was primarily due to increased earnings at beijing foton cummins engine co., ltd. as the joint venture continued to increase market share with the new heavy-duty engine platform introduced in 2014, partially offset by lower earnings at dongfeng cummins engine company, ltd. and an asset impairment of $12 million.
2014 vs. 2013
sales engine segment sales increased $949 million versus 2013. the following were the primary drivers by market:
•   heavy-duty truck engine sales increased due to improved demand in the north american heavy-duty truck market with higher engine shipments of 29 percent.
•   medium-duty truck and bus sales increased, primarily due to market share gains in the north american medium-duty truck and bus markets, partially offset by weaker international demand.
•   light-duty automotive sales increased, primarily due to a 9 percent increase in units shipped to chrysler.
the increases above were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations (primarily the brazilian real and indian rupee).

2015 vs. 2014
sales distribution segment sales increased $1,055 million versus 2014, primarily due to $1.4 billion of segment sales related to the consolidation of partially-owned north american distributors since december 31, 2013, $75 million of organic sales growth primarily in africa and asia pacific and $25 million of segment sales growth related to the acquisition of international distributors, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations (primarily the australian dollar, canadian dollar, euro, south african rand and brazilian real) and decreased sales in china, western europe, south america and russia.
segment ebit in the fourth quarter of 2015, we incurred a restructuring charge of $23 million for actions primarily in the form of professional voluntary and involuntary employee separation programs in response to the continued deterioration in our global markets in the second half of 2015, as well as expected reductions in orders in most u.s. and global markets in 2016.
distribution segment ebit decreased $79 million versus 2014, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations (primarily the australian dollar, canadian dollar and south african rand), higher selling, general and administrative expenses, lower equity, royalty and interest income from investees and restructuring actions and other charges, partially offset by higher gross margin due to the acquisitions of north american distributors. the acquisitions resulted in $24 million and $36 million of additional amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by gains of $18 million and $73 million related to the remeasurement of our pre-existing ownership interests for north american distributor acquisitions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) in 2015 and 2014, respectively. the decrease in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was the result of the acquisition of north american distributors. major components of ebit and related changes to segment ebit and ebit as a percentage of sales were as follows:

2015 vs. 2014
sales components segment sales increased $54 million versus 2014. the following were the primary drivers by business:
•   emission solutions sales increased, primarily due to improved demand in the north american on-highway markets and increased demand in china, partially offset by unfavorable pricing and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations.
•   fuel systems sales increased due to the new beijing foton isg engine that entered production in the second quarter of 2014 in china and improved demand in certain north american on-highway markets.
the increases above were partially offset by the following:
•   turbo technologies sales decreased, primarily due to lower demand in china, europe and brazil and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by higher demand in the north american on-highway markets.
•   filtration sales decreased, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations and lower demand in europe, asia pacific and brazil, partially offset by higher demand in china.
unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations were primarily driven by the euro, brazilian real and british pound.

2014 vs. 2013
sales power generation segment sales decreased $135 million overall and declined in all lines of business and across most markets versus 2013, primarily due to lower industrial activity. the following are the primary drivers by business:
•   power products sales decreased, primarily due to lower demand in north america driven by declining military sales and lower demand in india, mexico and russia, partially offset by increases in china, africa and western europe.
•   alternators sales decreased due to lower demand in western europe, india and asia, partially offset by increased demand in the u.k. and china.
•   power systems sales decreased, primarily due to reduced demand in north america and western europe, partially offset by higher demand in latin america and brazil.
•   foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales (primarily the indian rupee and brazilian real).
operating actions power generation took multiple actions in the fourth quarter of 2014 to reduce its future cost structure. costs associated with these actions were $32 million and are primarily related to the closure of a plant in germany. we also initiated other targeted actions throughout the business including various headcount reductions to better align capacity with the current levels of demand. these actions resulted in a power generation headcount reduction of approximately 250 employees and unfavorable impacts to gross margin of $22 million, selling, general and administrative expense of $6 million and research and development expenses of $4 million. the majority of these costs were accrued as of december 31, 2014, and were paid in 2015.

liquidity and capital resources key working capital and balance sheet data we fund our working capital with cash from operations and short-term borrowings when necessary. various assets and liabilities, including short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. as a result, working capital is a prime focus of management attention. working capital and balance sheet measures are provided in the following table:

2015 vs. 2014
net cash provided by operating activities decreased $207 million versus 2014, primarily due to lower consolidated net income of $266 million and unfavorable working capital fluctuations of $328 million, partially offset by the impact of the non-cash impairment of light-duty diesel assets of $211 million. during 2015, the higher working capital requirements resulted in a cash outflow of $260 million compared to a cash inflow of $68 million in 2014. this change of $328 million was primarily driven by a decrease in accrued expenses and accounts payable, partially offset by a decrease in inventory and accounts and notes receivable.
net cash used in investing activities decreased $316 million versus 2014, primarily due to lower cash investment for the acquisitions of businesses of $319 million.
net cash used in financing activities increased $301 million versus 2014, primarily due to higher common stock repurchases of $230 million and higher dividend payments of $110 million.
53
2014 vs. 2013
net cash provided by operating activities increased $177 million versus 2013, primarily due to higher consolidated net income and favorable working capital fluctuations, partially offset by unfavorable deferred income taxes and higher pension contributions in excess of expense. during 2014, the lower working capital resulted in a cash inflow of $68 million, compared to a cash outflow of $65 million in 2013. this change of $133 million was primarily driven by an increase in accrued expenses and accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in other current assets and inventories in 2014, versus the comparable period in 2013. the increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to higher income taxes payable, while the change in other current assets was largely due to the receipt of an income tax refund in 2013.
net cash used in investing activities increased $388 million versus 2013, primarily due to higher cash investment for the acquisition of businesses in 2014 of $289 million and higher capital expenditures of $67 million, partially offset by reduced purchases of corporate owned life insurance of $40 million.
net cash used in financing activities increased $1,395 million versus 2013, primarily due to lower proceeds from borrowings of $949 million. in september 2013, we issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes consisting of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.65% senior unsecured notes due in 2023 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior unsecured notes due in 2043. net proceeds from the issuance were $979 million.
sources of liquidity we generate significant ongoing cash flow, which has been used, in part, to fund working capital, common stock repurchases, capital expenditures, dividends on our common stock, acquisitions, projected pension obligations, debt service and restructuring actions and other charges. cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity with $2.1 billion provided in 2015.
at december 31, 2015, our sources of liquidity included:
•   cash and cash equivalents of $1.7 billion, of which approximately 26 percent was located in the u.s. and 74 percent was located outside the u.s., primarily in the u.k., china and singapore,
•   revolving credit facility with $1.74 billion available, net of letters of credit,
•   international and other domestic short-term credit facilities with $184 million available and
•   marketable securities of $100 million, of which 66 percent is located in india and 33 percent is located in the u.s. and the majority of which could be liquidated into cash within a few days.
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities a significant portion of our cash flow is generated outside the u.s. at december 31, 2015, the total of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $1.3 billion, the vast majority of which was located in the u.k., china and singapore. the geographic location of our cash and marketable securities aligns well with our ongoing investments. we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. as a result, we do not anticipate any local liquidity restrictions to preclude us from funding our operating needs with local resources.
if we distribute our foreign cash balances to the u.s. or to other foreign subsidiaries, we could be required to accrue and pay u.s. taxes. for example, we would be required to accrue and pay additional u.s. taxes if we repatriated cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings we have asserted are permanently reinvested outside of the u.s. foreign earnings for which we assert permanent reinvestment outside the u.s. consist primarily of earnings of our china and u.k. domiciled subsidiaries. at present, we do not foresee a need to repatriate any earnings from these subsidiaries for which we have asserted permanent reinvestment. however, to help fund cash needs of the u.s. or other international subsidiaries as they arise, we repatriate available cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are not permanently reinvested when it is cost effective to do so. earnings generated after 2011 from our china operations are considered permanently reinvested, while earnings generated prior to 2012, for which u.s. deferred tax liabilities have been recorded, are expected to be repatriated in future years.
debt facilities and other sources of liquidity on november 13, 2015, we entered into an amended and restated five-year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders. the credit agreement provides us with a $1.75 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, the proceeds of which are to be used for working capital or other general corporate purposes. see note 11, "debt," to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. the credit agreement includes one financial covenant: a leverage ratio. the required
54
leverage ratio, which measures the sum of total debt plus securitization financing to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda) as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, for the four fiscal quarters ended on such date may not exceed 3.50 to 1.0. at december 31, 2015, our leverage ratio was 0.57 to 1.0.
we have an automatic shelf registration filed with the securities and exchange commission under which we may offer, from time to time, debt securities, common stock, preferred and preference stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units. our current shelf is scheduled to expire in september of 2016. we plan to file a new automatic shelf registration statement in the first quarter of 2016.
the maturity schedule of our existing long-term debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term. required annual principal payments range from $5 million to $39 million over each of the next five years.
uses of cash share repurchases in july 2014, the board of directors authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of additional common stock upon completion of the 2012 repurchase program. in 2015, we made the following purchases under the respective purchase programs:

(1) the remaining authorized capacities under the 2012 and 2014 plans were calculated based on the cost to purchase the shares, but exclude commission expenses in accordance with the authorized plans.
in november 2015, our board of directors authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of additional common stock upon the completion of the 2014 repurchase plan.
on february 9, 2016, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (asr) agreement with goldman, sachs & co. to purchase $500 million of our common stock. this asr agreement is part of our previously announced share repurchase plans authorized by the board of directors. pursuant to the terms of the agreement, there will be an initial delivery of approximately 4 million shares. the final number of shares to be repurchased will be based on our volume-weighted average stock price during the terms of the transaction, less a discount. the asr is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2016.
dividends total dividends paid to common shareholders in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $622 million, $512 million and $420 million respectively. declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon our income and liquidity position, among other factors, and is subject to declaration by our board of directors, who meet quarterly to consider our dividend payment. we expect to fund dividend payments with cash from operations.
in july 2015, our board of directors authorized an increase to our quarterly dividend of 25 percent from $0.78 per share to $0.975 per share. in july 2014, the board of directors authorized a 25 percent increase to our quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.625 per share to $0.78 per share. in july 2013, the board of directors authorized a 25 percent increase to our quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.50 per share to $0.625 per share. cash dividends per share paid to common shareholders for the last three years were as follows:

capital expenditures capital expenditures and spending on internal use software were $799 million in 2015, compared to $798 million in 2014. despite the challenging international economies, we continue to invest in new product lines and targeted capacity expansions. we plan to spend between $600 million and $650 million in 2016 as we continue with product launches and facility improvements. approximately 50 percent of our capital expenditures are expected to be invested outside of the u.s. in 2016.
pensions the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets, market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans. in 2015, the investment return on our u.s. pension trust was negative 0.1 percent while our u.k. pension trust return was 1.3 percent. approximately 77 percent of our pension plan assets are held in highly liquid investments such as fixed income and equity securities. the remaining 23 percent of our plan assets are held in less liquid, but market valued investments, including real estate, private equity and insurance contracts.
we sponsor funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans. contributions to these plans were as follows:
years ended december 31, in millions                                                          2015                2014                2013

we anticipate making total contributions of approximately $150 million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2016. expected contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2016 will meet or exceed the current funding requirements.
restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of 2015, we executed worldwide work force restructuring actions primarily in the form of professional voluntary and involuntary employee separation programs in response to lower demand for our products in the u.s. and key markets around the world. we incurred a fourth quarter charge of $90 million ($61 million after-tax) for the headcount reductions, of which $86 million will be settled in cash. in the fourth quarter of 2015, we announced that we expect to close or restructure several manufacturing facilities over time which could result in future charges as we evaluate the appropriate size and structure of our manufacturing capacity.
acquisitions during 2015, we paid $120 million to acquire the remaining interest in three north american distributors, including the related debt retirements and recognized a total gain of $18 million on the fair value adjustment resulting from the acquisition of the controlling interests in two of these previously unconsolidated entities. we plan to spend an additional $85 million to $110 million on the north american distributor acquisitions and the related debt retirements in 2016.

management's assessment of liquidity our financial condition and liquidity remain strong. our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to credit and the capital markets. we believe our liquidity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital, common stock repurchases, capital expenditures, dividend payments, acquisitions of our north american distributors, projected pension obligations, debt service obligations and severance payments. we continue to generate cash from operations in the u.s. and maintain access to $1.7 billion of our revolver as noted above.

application of critical accounting estimates a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies," of our consolidated financial statements which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives.
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which often requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements. management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. in any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting estimates are defined as follows: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies, related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors. we believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs, accounting for income taxes and pension benefits.
58
warranty programs we estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold. our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management's best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ. as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable, which generally occurs when it is announced. our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates, repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle. future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability. new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch, with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch. we generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding product's warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation. we then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product historical experience for several subsequent quarters, and new product specific experience thereafter. note 12, "product warranty liability," to our consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2015 and 2014 including adjustments to pre-existing warranties.
accounting for income taxes we determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. at december 31, 2015, we recorded net deferred tax assets of $356 million. these assets included $236 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards. a valuation allowance of $209 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized. in the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. in addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. these audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. we accrue for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available. a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in note 5, "income taxes," to our consolidated financial statements.
pension benefits we sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the u.s. and the u.k. and to a lesser degree in various other countries. in the u.s. and the u.k. we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded. we account for our pension programs in accordance with employers' accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under gaap. gaap requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis. as a result, our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at december 31. these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities, assumed rates of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover rates, actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age, mortality rates and participant withdrawals. the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions, participant life span and withdrawal rates. these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension cost to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the future.
the expected long-term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension cost. we considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets. the long-term rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a five-year average market value of return. projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded fixed income and equity indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. at december 31, 2015, based upon our target asset allocations, it is anticipated that our u.s. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 10-year projection period equal to or in excess of 7.5 percent approximately 18 percent of the time while returns of 8.0 percent or greater are anticipated 13 percent of the time. we expect additional positive returns from active investment management. despite the 2015 one-year return of (0.1) percent, our plan assets have averaged 10.5 percent returns since 2010, and resulted in approximately $272 million of actuarial
59
gains in accumulated other comprehensive income in the same period. based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we believe an investment return assumption of 7.5 percent per year in 2016 for u.s. pension assets is reasonable.
the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the u.k. was based on establishing an equity-risk premium over current long-term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations. at december 31, 2015, based upon our target asset allocations, it is anticipated that our u.k. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20-year projection period equal to or in excess of 4.4 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 5.1 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time. we expect additional positive returns from active investment management. the one-year return for our u.k. plan was 1.3 percent for 2015, and similar to our u.s. plan, the strong returns since 2010 have resulted in approximately $214 million of actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive income. our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long-term outlook. therefore, the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a long-term horizon. based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we believe an investment return assumption of 4.7 percent in 2016 for u.k. pension assets is reasonable. our pension plan asset allocations at december 31, 2015 and 2014 and target allocation for 2016 are as follows:

the differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long-term return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic cost over five years. the table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension cost for the period 2013-2015 and our expected rate of return for 2016.

a lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension cost and reduce profitability.
gaap for pensions offers various acceptable alternatives to account for the differences that eventually arise between the estimates used in the actuarial valuations and the actual results. it is acceptable to delay or immediately recognize these differences. under the delayed recognition alternative, changes in pension obligation (including those resulting from plan amendments) and changes in the value of assets set aside to meet those obligations are not recognized in net periodic pension cost as they occur but are recognized initially in comprehensive income and subsequently amortized as components of net periodic pension cost systematically and gradually over future periods. in addition to this approach, gaap also allows immediate recognition of actuarial gains or losses. immediate recognition introduces volatility in financial results. we have chosen to delay recognition and amortize actuarial differences over future periods. if we adopted the immediate recognition approach, we would record a loss of $917 million ($616 million after-tax) from cumulative actuarial net losses for our u.s. and u.k. pension plans.
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and, under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10 percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation, amortized over future years of service. this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions. under gaap, the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. at december 31, 2015, we had net pension actuarial losses of $689 million and $228 million for the u.s. and u.k. pension plans, respectively. as these amounts exceed 10 percent of their respective plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees. net actuarial losses decreased our shareholders' equity by $63 million (after-tax) in 2015. the loss is due to unfavorable asset performance in the u.s. and u.k., partially offset by higher discount rates in both the u.s. and u.k.

the table below sets forth the net periodic pension cost for the period 2013-2015 and our expected cost for 2016.
in millions                 2016            2015            2014            2013
net periodic pension cost         $41             $63             $57             $87
we expect 2016 net periodic pension cost to decrease when compared to 2015, due to reduced loss amortizations in the u.s. and u.k. and higher discount rates, partially offset by lower expected asset returns for the u.k. plan as we de-risk plan trust assets. the increase in periodic pension cost in 2015 compared to 2014 was due to lower discount rates in the u.s. and u.k. and unfavorable mortality demographics in the u.s., partially offset by favorable expected return on asset performance in both the u.s. and u.k. the decrease in periodic pension cost in 2014 compared to 2013 was due to reduced loss amortizations resulting from improved u.s. asset performance and a higher discount rate in the u.s. another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension cost is the discount rate. the weighted average discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension cost are set forth in the table below.
discount rates
2016          2015          2014          2013
u.s. plans      4.47   %      4.07   %      4.83   %      3.97   %

changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension cost calculation.
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. the guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in gaap which suggests the use of a high-quality corporate bond rate. we used bond information provided by moody's investor services, inc. and standard & poor's rating services. all bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the u.s. and u.k. were deemed high-quality, non-callable bonds (aa or better) at december 31, 2015, by at least one of the bond rating agencies.
our model called for projected payments until near extinction for the u.s. and the u.k. for both countries, our model matches the present value of the plan's projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio. a single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with the value of the bond portfolio. the resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan's distinct liability characteristics.
the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2016 net periodic pension cost relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets.
in millions         impact on pension cost increase/(decrease)
discount rate used to value liabilities
0.25 percent increase                              $(12                )
0.25 percent decrease                                13
expected rate of return on assets
1 percent increase                               (43                )
1 percent decrease                                43
the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. a higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension cost. a lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension cost. it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. note 10, "pension and other postretirement benefits," to our consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity, the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements.
recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements accounting pronouncements recently adopted in may 2015, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) amended its fair value standard related to the disclosure of investments in certain entities that calculate the net asset value per share (nav) or an equivalent measure. this amendment
61
provides the option to exclude investments measured using the nav to represent fair value from the fair value hierarchy. the new rules will become effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2015, however early adoption is permitted and we have chosen to adopt this standard as of december 31, 2015. this resulted in u.s. pension plan assets of $1,094 million and $1,186 million and u.k, pension plan assets of $514 million and $497 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, being removed from the three-level valuation hierarchy. note 10, ''pension and other postretirement benefits,'' to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of our pension plan assets. our consolidated financial statements do not include any other investments for which nav is used to represent fair value.
in november 2015, the fasb amended its standards related to balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. this amendment requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position. the new rules will become effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2016. however, early adoption is permitted and we have chosen to adopt the standard prospectively as of september 28, 2015. as a result, prior periods have not been adjusted to reflect this change.
in april 2015, the fasb amended its standards related to the balance sheet classification of debt issuance costs. this amendment requires entities to present debt issuance costs related to a debt liability as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt and requires retrospective application. the new rules will become effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2016, however early adoption is permitted and we have chosen to adopt this standard as of september 28, 2015. this resulted in the reclassification of $12 million from "other assets" in our december 31, 2014, consolidated balance sheet to a reduction of our "long-term debt."
accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective in january 2016, the fasb amended its standards related to the accounting of certain financial instruments. this amendment addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. the new rules will become effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is not permitted. we are in the process of evaluating the impact the amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements.
in may 2014, the fasb amended its standards related to revenue recognition. this amendment replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance and provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers. the standard contains principles that we will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. the underlying principle is that we will recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. the guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. other major provisions include capitalization of certain contract costs, consideration of the time value of money in the transaction price and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. the amendment also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to fulfill a contract. the standard allows either full or modified retrospective adoption effective for annual and interim periods beginning january 1, 2018. we are in the process of evaluating the impact the amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements. while a final decision has not been made, we are currently planning to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach.

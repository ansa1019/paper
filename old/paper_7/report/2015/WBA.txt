item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein. this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements. factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" below and in "risk factors" in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k. references herein to the "company", "we", "us", or "our" refer to walgreens boots alliance, inc. and its subsidiaries from and after the effective time of the reorganization on december 31, 2014 and, prior to that time, to its predecessor walgreen co. and its subsidiaries, and in each case do not include unconsolidated partially-owned entities, except as otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires.
overview on december 31, 2014, walgreens boots alliance, inc. became the successor of walgreen co. pursuant to a merger to effect a reorganization of walgreens into a holding company structure, with walgreens boots alliance becoming the parent holding company. pursuant to the reorganization, walgreens became a wholly-owned subsidiary of walgreens boots alliance, a delaware corporation formed for purposes of the reorganization, and each issued and outstanding share of walgreens common stock was converted into one share of walgreens boots alliance common stock. walgreens boots alliance, as successor to walgreens, replaced walgreens as the publicly-held corporation.
on december 31, 2014, following the completion of the reorganization, walgreens boots alliance completed the acquisition of the remaining 55% of alliance boots gmbh that walgreens did not previously own in exchange for Â£3.133 billion ($4.874 billion) in cash and approximately 144.3 million shares of walgreens boots alliance common stock pursuant to the purchase and option agreement. walgreens previously had acquired, on august 2, 2012, a 45% equity interest in alliance boots along with a call option to acquire the remaining 55% equity interest in alliance boots in exchange for $4.025 billion in cash and approximately 83.4 million shares of walgreens common stock.
prior to the completion of the second step transaction, we accounted for our 45% investment in alliance boots using the equity method of accounting. investments accounted for under the equity method are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of the net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions to or from these entities. net income reported by alliance boots during this period was translated from british pounds sterling at the average rate for the period. upon completion of the second step transaction, alliance boots became a consolidated subsidiary and ceased being accounted for under the equity method. for financial reporting and accounting purposes, walgreens boots alliance was the acquirer of alliance boots. the consolidated financial statements (and other data, such as prescriptions filled) reflect the results of operations and financial position of walgreens and its subsidiaries for periods prior to december 31, 2014 and of walgreens boots alliance and its subsidiaries for periods from and after the effective time of the reorganization on december 31, 2014.
recent development on october 27, 2015, the company entered into the merger agreement with rite aid, pursuant to which the company agreed to acquire rite aid, a drugstore chain in the united states with 4,561 stores in 31 states and the district of columbia as of august 29, 2015. on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, rite aid will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company and rite aid stockholders will be entitled to receive $9.00 in cash for each outstanding share of rite aid common stock, for a total enterprise value of approximately $17.2 billion, including acquired net debt. the transaction is expected to close in the second half of calendar 2016, subject to rite aid stockholder approval, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
we intend to finance the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and debt financing. concurrently with the signing of the merger agreement, the company entered into a bridge facility commitment letter (the "commitment letter"), dated october 27, 2015, with ubs securities llc and ubs ag, stamford branch for a $12.8 billion senior unsecured bridge facility (the "facility"). the facility, if funded, will mature 364 days after the initial borrowings; provided that the company can extend up to $3.0 billion of the facility for an additional 90 day period if desired. the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the facility will be libor or the applicable base rate plus a margin. the financing commitments of the lenders are subject to certain customary conditions set forth in the commitment letter. we expect to obtain permanent financing for the transaction prior to the closing date, which would replace the facility.
comparability as a result of the completion of the second step transaction on december 31, 2014, there are a number of items that affect comparability for the company. historically, walgreens operations were within one reportable segment that included the results of the retail pharmacy usa division and corporate costs, along with the full consolidated results of wbad and equity earnings from alliance boots (on a three-month reporting lag). upon completion of the second step transaction, alliance boots became a consolidated subsidiary and the company eliminated the three-month reporting lag. prior period results have been recast to reflect the elimination of the reporting lag. additionally, following the completion of the reorganization and the second step transaction on december 31, 2014, the company now reports results in three segments. segmental reporting includes the allocation of synergy benefits, including wbad's results, and the combined corporate costs for periods subsequent to december 31, 2014. the company has determined that it is impracticable to allocate historical results to the current segmental presentation.
the completion of the second step transaction on december 31, 2014 also means that results for fiscal 2015 include the results of alliance boots for eight months (january through august 2015) on a fully consolidated basis and four months (september through december 2014) as equity income from walgreen's pre-closing 45 percent interest.
the company's balance sheet reflects the full consolidation of alliance boots assets and liabilities as a result of the close of the combination on december 31, 2014. the company's purchase accounting remains preliminary as contemplated by gaap and, as a result, there may be upon further review future changes to the value, as well as allocation, of the acquired assets and liabilities, associated amortization expense, goodwill and the gain on the previously held equity interest. these changes may be material.
year-over-year comparisons of results require consideration of the foregoing factors and are not directly comparable.
in addition, the company's sales are affected by a number of factors including, among others, our sales performance during holiday periods and during the cough, cold and flu season, significant weather conditions, timing of our own or competitor discount programs and pricing actions, levels of reimbursement from governmental agencies and other third party health providers and general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate.

amerisourcebergen corporation relationship on march 19, 2013, walgreens, alliance boots and amerisourcebergen announced various agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between walgreens and amerisourcebergen pursuant to which branded and generic pharmaceutical products are sourced from amerisourcebergen in the u.s.; an agreement which provides amerisourcebergen the ability to access generics and related pharmaceutical products through wbad, a global sourcing enterprise formed by walgreens and alliance boots; and agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in amerisourcebergen and gain associated representation on amerisourcebergen's board of directors in certain circumstances. in addition to the information in this report, please refer to our current report on form 8-k filed on march 20, 2013, for more detailed information regarding these agreements and arrangements. at august 31, 2015, the company owned approximately 5.2% of the outstanding common shares in amerisourcebergen and had designated one member of amerisourcebergen's board of directors.
restructuring programs on april 8, 2015, the board of directors approved a plan to implement a new restructuring program (the "cost transformation program") as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. the cost transformation program implements and builds on the planned three-year, $1.0 billion cost-reduction initiative previously announced by walgreens on august 6, 2014 and includes a number of elements designed to help achieve profitable growth through increased cost efficiencies. we have identified additional opportunities for cost savings that increase the total expected cost savings of the cost transformation program by $500 million to a projected $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2017. significant areas of focus include plans to close approximately 200 stores across the u.s.; reorganize divisional and field operations; drive operating efficiencies; and streamline information technology and other functions. the actions under the cost transformation program focus primarily on our retail pharmacy usa division, and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2017.
we currently estimate that we will recognize cumulative pre-tax charges to our gaap financial results of between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate payments, asset impairments and employee termination and other business transition and exit costs. we expect to incur pre-tax charges of between $525 million and $600 million for real estate costs, including lease obligations (net of estimated sublease income), between $650 million and $725 million for asset impairment charges relating primarily to asset write-offs from store closures, information technology, inventory and other non-operational real estate asset write-offs, and between $425 million and $475 million for employee severance and other business transition and exit costs. we estimate that approximately 60% of the cumulative pre-tax charges will result in immediate or future cash expenditures, primarily related to lease and other real estate payments and employee separation costs.
we incurred pre-tax charges of $542 million ($223 million related to asset impairment charges, $202 million in real estate costs and $117 million in severance and other business transition and exit costs) related to the cost transformation program in fiscal 2015. the majority of the charges incurred in fiscal 2015 related to activities within the retail pharmacy usa division but also included activities within retail pharmacy international. all charges related to the cost transformation program have been recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. we closed 84 stores in the united states related to the cost transformation program in fiscal 2015.
on march 24, 2014, the board of directors approved a plan to close underperforming stores in efforts to optimize and focus resources within our retail pharmacy usa operations in a manner intended to increase shareholder value. as of august 31, 2015, we have closed 68 locations, one of which was closed in fiscal 2015. in fiscal 2015, we incurred total pre-tax charges related to this plan of $17 million primarily related to lease termination costs. in fiscal 2014, we incurred pre-tax charges of $209 million ($137 million from lease termination costs, $71 million from asset impairments and $1 million of other charges). all charges related to this plan have been recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. we expect to incur no additional costs related to this plan.

executive summary the following table presents certain key financial statistics for the company for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013. all periods have been recast to reflect the removal of the three-month reporting lag applied to reporting equity earnings in alliance boots prior to december 31, 2014. additionally, as a result of the completion of the second step transaction, alliance boots became a consolidated subsidiary and the company ceased recording equity earnings in alliance boots on december 31, 2014. as a result, fiscal 2015 includes the results of alliance boots for eight months (january through august 2015) on a fully consolidated basis and four months (september through december 2014) as equity earnings in alliance boots reflecting walgreens' pre-closing 45 percent interest.

walgreens boots alliance results of operations fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014
our results for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 are primarily impacted by the second step transaction which resulted in the full consolidation of alliance boots results of operations beginning december 31, 2014. for fiscal 2015, the full consolidation of alliance boots operations increased our net sales by 29.4%, gross profit by 23.6%, selling general and administrative expenses by 24.1% and operating income by 18.5%, each as compared to fiscal 2014.
net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance, inc. for fiscal 2015 were $4.2 billion, or $4.00 per diluted share as compared to $1.9 billion, or $2.00 per diluted share in fiscal 2014. the increase in net earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, was primarily attributable to the full consolidation of alliance boots operations from january through august 2015, a gain on our 45% previously held equity interest in alliance boots, increased sales in our retail pharmacy usa division, increased income from our warrants to acquire amerisourcebergen common stock and a lower effective income tax rate. these increases were partially offset by lower retail pharmacy usa gross margins and a higher interest expense.
as a result of acquiring the remaining 55% interest in alliance boots on december 31, 2014, our previously held 45% interest was remeasured to fair value, resulting in a gain of $563 million in fiscal 2015. the fair value of the previously held equity interest in alliance boots was determined using the income approach methodology. the fair value measurement of the previously held equity interest is based on significant inputs not observable in the market. the fair value estimates for the previously held equity interest are based on (a) projected discounted cash flows, (b) historical and projected financial information, and (c) synergies including cost savings, as relevant, that market participants would consider when estimating the fair value of the previously held equity interest in alliance boots. see note 8, acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
other income (expense) for fiscal 2015 was income of $685 million as compared to expense of $481 million in fiscal 2014. the change in fair value of our amerisourcebergen warrants resulted in recording income of $759 million and $366 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increase in fair value was primarily attributed to the change in the price of amerisourcebergen's common stock. in addition, we recorded $20 million and $19 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively, of other income relating to the amortization of the deferred credit associated with the initial value of the walgreens warrants. we have also recorded a loss of $94 million in fiscal 2015 on derivative contracts that were not designated as accounting hedges. the losses primarily relate to foreign currency forward contracts entered into in consideration of the delivery of foreign cash consideration related to the second step transaction. fiscal 2014 results also included a loss of $866 million related to the alliance boots call option. upon the amendment and immediate exercise of the call option to acquire the remaining 55% ownership of alliance boots, we were required to compare the fair value of the amended option with the book value of the original option. the fair value of the amended option was estimated to be zero based on its valuation as a financial instrument without regard for its strategic value. the reduction in value was primarily due to the shorter duration of the amended option and the appreciation since the original valuation in the price of walgreens stock used as partial consideration for the purchase of the remaining 55% ownership interest in alliance boots.

interest was a net expense of $605 million and $156 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increase in fiscal 2015 interest expense is primarily due to the notes we issued to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable in connection with the second step transaction and to subsequently refinance substantially all of alliance boots outstanding borrowings following completion of the second step transaction. additionally, in fiscal 2015 we repaid a portion of our long-term debt in advance of its maturity resulting in additional net interest expense of $99 million.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 and 2014 was 19.9% and 42.9%, respectively. the decrease in the fiscal 2015 effective tax rate as compared to fiscal 2014 is primarily attributable to recording discrete tax benefits related to previously unrecognized capital loss deferred tax assets as a result of recognizing capital gain income from fiscal 2015 and anticipated future period sale-leaseback transactions. in addition, as a result of our acquisition of the remaining 55% interest in alliance boots that we did not previously own, our annual effective tax rate decreased due to incremental foreign source income taxed at lower rates and additional favorable permanent book-tax differences. also as a result of the acquisition, we recognized a non-recurring tax benefit that also lowered our annual effective tax rate. in addition, we recognized other, net discrete tax benefits in the current fiscal year.
walgreens boots alliance adjusted net earnings per diluted share (non-gaap measure)
adjusted net earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2015 was $3.88, an increase of 18.3% from $3.28 in fiscal 2014. the increase in adjusted net earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2015 was primarily attributable to the full consolidation of alliance boots operations from january through august 2015, increased sales and lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in our retail pharmacy usa division and a lower effective income tax rate. these increases were partially offset by lower retail pharmacy usa gross margins and a higher interest expense. see "--non-gaap measures" below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure.
fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance, inc. for fiscal 2014 were $1.9 billion or $2.00 per diluted share as compared to $2.5 billion, or $2.67 per diluted share in fiscal 2013. the decrease in fiscal 2014 net earnings per diluted share as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily attributable to lower gross margins in our retail pharmacy usa division, a loss related to the alliance boots call option and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by higher sales, lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales, increased equity earnings in alliance boots and increased gains on fair market value adjustments related to our amerisourcebergen warrants.
other income (expense) for the fiscal 2014 was expense of $481 million as compared to income of $120 million in fiscal 2013. fiscal 2014 results include a loss of $866 million related to the alliance boots call option. the change in fair value of our amerisourcebergen warrants resulted in recording income of $366 million and $111 million in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increase in fair value was primarily attributed to the change in the price of amerisourcebergen's common stock. in addition, we recorded $19 million and $9 million in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively, of other income relating to the amortization of the deferred credit associated with the initial value of the walgreens warrants.
interest was a net expense of $156 million and $165 million in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. the decrease in fiscal 2014 interest expense as compared to fiscal 2013 was due to the repayment of notes that matured in fiscal 2014 partially offset by higher interest charges related to incremental capital and finance lease obligations.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 and 2013 was 42.9% and 37.0%, respectively. the increase in the fiscal 2014 effective tax rate as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily attributable to the loss associated with the company's option to purchase the remaining equity interest in alliance boots, which did not generate a tax benefit in fiscal 2014, partially offset by the favorable impact of additional foreign source income taxed at lower rates.
walgreens boots alliance adjusted net earnings per diluted share (non-gaap measure)
adjusted net earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2014 were $3.28 compared to $3.25 in fiscal 2013. the increase in adjusted net earnings per diluted share for the fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily attributed to higher sales, lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales, and increased equity earnings in alliance boots, partially offset by lower gross margins in our retail pharmacy usa division. see "--non-gaap measures" below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure.

sales fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014
the retail pharmacy usa division's total sales for fiscal 2015 increased by 6.0% to $81.0 billion. total sales increased primarily due to higher comparable store sales, which were up 6.4% in fiscal 2015. comparable drugstores are defined as those that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days and without a major remodel or a natural disaster in the past twelve months. relocated and acquired stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after the relocation or acquisition. we operated 8,182 locations (8,173 drugstores) as of august 31, 2015, compared to 8,309 locations (8,207 drugstores) a year earlier. prior year's locations included 91 infusion and respiratory services facilities in which we sold a majority interest in fiscal 2015.

pharmacy sales increased by 8.2% in fiscal 2015 and represented 66.1% of the division's total sales. in fiscal 2014, pharmacy sales were up 7.9% and represented 64.2% of the division's total sales. comparable pharmacy sales increased 9.3% in fiscal 2015 compared to an increase of 6.8% in fiscal 2014. the effect of generic drugs, which have a lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs reduced prescription sales by 1.8% in fiscal 2015 versus a reduction of 1.3% in fiscal 2014. the effect of generics on division total sales was a reduction of 1.0% in fiscal 2015 compared to a reduction of 0.7% for fiscal 2014. third party sales, where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, employers or private insurers, were 96.8% of prescription sales for fiscal 2015 compared to 96.5% for fiscal 2014. the total number of prescriptions (including immunizations) filled in fiscal 2015 was approximately 723 million compared to 699 million in fiscal 2014. prescriptions (including immunizations) adjusted to 30 day equivalents were 894 million in fiscal 2015 versus 856 million in fiscal 2014.
retail sales increased 1.9% in fiscal 2015 and were 33.9% of the division's total sales. in comparison, fiscal 2014 retail sales increased 2.1% and comprised 35.8% of the division's total sales. comparable retail sales increased 1.5% in fiscal 2015 compared to an increase of 2.0% in fiscal 2014. the increase in comparable retail sales in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily attributed to an increase in basket size partially offset by lower customer traffic.
operating income fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014
retail pharmacy usa division's operating income for fiscal 2015 decreased 7.2% to $3.9 billion. the decrease is primarily due to having equity earnings in alliance boots for four months in the current year versus twelve months in the comparable period and current year costs related to the cost transformation program.
gross margin as a percent of total sales was 26.9% in fiscal 2015 compared to 28.2% in fiscal 2014. pharmacy margins were negatively impacted in the current fiscal year by lower third-party reimbursements; an increase in medicare part d mix including the strategy to continue driving 90-day prescriptions at retail; and the mix of specialty drugs, which carry a lower margin percentage. the decrease in pharmacy margins was partially offset by additional brand-to-generic drug conversions compared with the prior fiscal year. retail margins were positively impacted in fiscal 2015 primarily from the non-prescription drug, beauty and beverage and snack categories partially offset by the electronics category.
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales were 22.5% in fiscal 2015 compared to 23.6% in fiscal 2014. as a percentage of total sales, expenses in fiscal 2015 were lower primarily due to store labor efficiencies partially offset by higher costs related to the cost transformation program.
adjusted operating income (non-gaap measure) fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014
retail pharmacy usa division's adjusted operating income for fiscal 2015 increased 4.8% to $5.1 billion. the increase is primarily due to higher sales and lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales partially offset by having four months of equity earnings in alliance boots in fiscal 2015 versus twelve months in fiscal 2014 and lower gross margins. see "--non-gaap measures" below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure.
sales fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013

operating income fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
retail pharmacy usa division's operating income for fiscal 2014 was $4.2 billion, an increase of 2.5% compared to fiscal 2013. the increase is primarily due to higher sales and increased equity earnings in alliance boots, partially offset by lower gross margins.
gross margin as a percent of total sales was 28.2% in fiscal 2014, compared to 29.3% in fiscal 2013. gross margin in fiscal 2014 was negatively impacted by lower retail pharmacy margins primarily from lower third-party reimbursement; the increase in medicare part d mix and the strategy to continue driving 90-day prescriptions at retail; fewer brand-to-generic drug conversions compared with the prior year period; generic drug inflation on a subset of generic drugs; and the mix of specialty drugs, which carry a lower margin percentage. retail margins were negatively impacted in the photofinishing, non-prescription drug and convenience and fresh foods categories. pharmacy and retail margin decreases were partially offset by purchasing synergies realized from wbad and a lower provision for lifo in fiscal 2014.
selling, general and administrative expenses were 23.6% of total sales in fiscal 2014, compared to 24.3% of total sales in fiscal 2013. as a percentage of total sales, expenses were lower primarily due to lower store compensation costs, store occupancy costs and headquarters costs, partially offset by costs related to our store optimization plan.

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were $3.0 billion (including $1.7 billion in foreign jurisdictions) as of august 31, 2015, compared to $2.6 billion (including $177 million in foreign jurisdictions) as of august 31, 2014. short-term investment objectives are primarily to minimize risk and maintain liquidity. to attain these objectives, investment limits are placed on the amount, type and issuer of securities. investments are principally in u.s. treasury market funds and aaa rated money market funds.
our long-term capital policy is to maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility; reinvest in our core strategies; invest in strategic opportunities that reinforce our core strategies and meet return requirements; and return surplus cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the long term.
cash provided by operations and the issuance of debt are the principal sources of funds for expansion, investments, acquisitions, remodeling programs, dividends to shareholders and stock repurchases. net cash provided by operating activities was $5.7 billion in fiscal 2015 compared to $3.9 billion in fiscal 2014 and $4.3 billion in fiscal 2013. the increase in fiscal 2015 cash provided by operating activities was primarily a result of higher net earnings as a result of the inclusion of alliance boots operations on a fully-consolidated basis from january to august and working capital improvements compared to the prior fiscal year.

(1)   our retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale segments were acquired as part of the second step transaction in which we acquired the 55% of alliance boots that we did not already own on december 31, 2014. as a result of the timing of the acquisition, only eight months (january through august 2015) of capital expenditures have been reported.

additionally, investing activities for fiscal 2015 included proceeds related to sale-leaseback transactions and the sale of walgreens infusion services of $867 million and $814 million, respectively. no amerisourcebergen common stock was purchased in fiscal 2015 compared to $493 million in fiscal 2014 and $224 million in fiscal 2013.
net cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2015 was $915 million compared to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2014 and $1.5 billion in fiscal 2013. in fiscal 2015, we received proceeds from public offerings of $8.0 billion of u.s. dollar denominated debt, approximately $2.0 billion of euro and pound sterling denominated debt and borrowed approximately $2.2 billion on a pound sterling denominated term loan (each as described below). the proceeds from these offerings and funds from the term loan were used to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable in connection with the second step transaction, refinance substantially all of alliance boots outstanding borrowings following the completion of the second step transaction and pay related fees and expenses. additionally in fiscal 2015, we repaid $1.8 billion of notes prior to their stated maturity (as described below). we repurchased shares to support the needs of the employee stock plans totaling $500 million in fiscal 2015, compared to $705 million in fiscal 2014 and $615 million in fiscal 2013. additionally, we purchased $726 million of stock related to the 2014 stock repurchase program in fiscal 2015. no purchases related to the 2014 stock repurchase program were made in fiscal 2014. proceeds related to employee stock plans were $503 million in fiscal 2015, compared to $612 million in fiscal 2014 and $486 million in fiscal 2013. cash dividends paid were $1.4 billion in fiscal 2015 compared to $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. the company intends to continue to maintain a long-term dividend payout ratio target of approximately 30 to 35 percent of adjusted net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance, inc.
in august 2014, our board of directors authorized the 2014 stock repurchase program, which authorizes the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of the company's common stock prior to its expiration on august 31, 2016. we purchased 8.2 million shares under the 2014 stock repurchase program in fiscal 2015 at a cost of $726 million.
we determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity, the economic environment and other factors. because the consideration payable to rite aid stockholders will be paid in cash, we plan to suspend activity under this program. the timing and amount of purchases under the program may change at any time and from time to time. we have repurchased, and may from time to time in the future repurchase, shares on the open market through rule 10b-1 plans, which enable a company to repurchase shares at times when it otherwise might be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws.

we periodically borrow under our commercial paper program and may continue to borrow under it in future periods. there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at august 31, 2015 or 2014. we had average daily short-term borrowings of $82 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 0.52% in fiscal 2015 as compared to average daily short-term borrowings of $4 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 0.23% in fiscal 2014.
on november 10, 2014, walgreens boots alliance and walgreens entered into a term loan credit agreement (the "term loan agreement") which provides us with the ability to borrow up to Â£1.45 billion on an unsecured basis. as of august 31, 2015, we have borrowed Â£1.45 billion ($2.2 billion at the august 31, 2015 spot rate of $1.54 to Â£1) under the term loan agreement. borrowings under the term loan agreement bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the reserve adjusted libor plus an applicable margin based on our credit ratings.
on november 10, 2014, walgreens boots alliance and walgreens entered into a five-year unsecured, multicurrency revolving credit agreement (the "revolving credit agreement"), which replaced prior walgreens agreements dated july 20, 2011 and july 23, 2012. the new unsecured revolving credit agreement initially totaled $2.25 billion, of which $375 million was available for the issuance of letters of credit. on december 29, 2014, upon the affirmative vote of the majority of common shares of walgreens represented and entitled to vote at the walgreens special meeting of shareholders to approve the issuance of the shares necessary to complete the second step transaction, the available credit increased to $3.0 billion, of which $500 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit. the issuance of letters of credit reduces the aggregate amount otherwise available under the revolving credit agreement for the making of revolving loans. borrowings under the revolving credit agreement will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at our option, the alternate base rate or the reserve adjusted libor, in each case, plus an applicable margin calculated based on our credit ratings.
total upfront fees related to the term loan agreement and revolving credit agreement were $14 million. we pay a facility fee to the financing banks to keep these lines of credit active. at august 31, 2015, there were no borrowings or letters of credit issued against the revolving credit facility.
walgreens guaranteed the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of walgreens boots alliance under the term loan agreement and the revolving credit agreement until august 10, 2015, when such guarantees were unconditionally released and discharged (as described below). see note 10, short-term borrowings and long-term debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k.

on november 20, 2014, the company issued a series of unsecured, unsubordinated notes that included total pound sterling denominated debt of Â£700 million ($1.1 billion based on the november 20, 2014 exchange rate) with maturities due 2020 and 2025 and euro denominated debt of â¬750 million ($940 million based on the november 20, 2014 exchange rate) due 2026. all notes issued on november 20, 2014 have fixed interest rates. the notes issued on november 18, 2014 and november 20, 2014 are collectively referred to as the wba notes. the wba notes were, upon initial issuance, fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by walgreens. see note 10, short-term borrowings and long-term debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k.
on december 19, 2014, walgreens boots alliance and walgreens entered into a revolving credit agreement (the "364-day credit agreement") with the lenders party thereto. the 364-day credit agreement is a 364-day unsecured, multicurrency revolving facility. the aggregate commitment of all lenders under the 364-day credit agreement is $750 million. the company pays a facility fee to the financing banks to keep this line of credit active. at august 31, 2015, there were no borrowings against the 364-day credit agreement. on july 9, 2015, the 364-day credit agreement was amended to remove walgreens as a borrower thereunder, eliminate walgreens' guarantee of all obligations of walgreens boots alliance thereunder and make certain conforming changes to effectuate those modifications, including modifications and deletions of certain definitions and cross-references.
the 364-day credit agreement and the term loan agreement and revolving credit agreement described above each contain a covenant to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed 0.60 to 1.00, as well as other customary restrictive covenants. at august 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all such covenants.

pending transaction. the cash consideration payable to rite aid stockholders pursuant to the merger agreement described under "recent development" above is expected to be financed with a combination of cash on hand and debt financing. on october 27, 2015, the company entered into a bridge facility commitment letter (the "commitment letter") with ubs securities llc and ubs ag, stamford branch for a $12.8 billion senior unsecured bridge facility (the "facility"). subject to certain customary terms and conditions, the facility may be used to fund, in part, the cash consideration payable to rite aid stockholders pursuant to the merger agreement, to repay the indebtedness of rite aid to be repaid in connection with the transaction and to pay related fees and expenses.
borrowings under the facility will bear interest at a fluctuating rate equal to, at our option, libor or the applicable base rate, plus a margin calculated as described in the commitment letter. we will also pay certain customary fees as described in the commitment letter. the facility, if funded, will mature 364 days after the initial borrowings; provided that the company can extend up to $3.0 billion of the facility for an additional 90 day period if desired. the closing of the facility and the availability of the loans thereunder are subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions as provided in the commitment letter. the definitive loan documentation for the facility will contain certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default consistent with the terms set forth in the commitment letter and otherwise substantially similar to the terms set forth in our existing revolving credit agreement, dated as of november 10, 2014, in all material respects unless otherwise mutually and reasonably agreed.

pursuant to our arrangements with amerisourcebergen, we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in amerisourcebergen over time through open market purchases and pursuant to warrants to acquire amerisourcebergen common stock. we can acquire up to 19,859,795 shares in the open market, which represents approximately 7% of the outstanding amerisourcebergen common stock on a fully diluted basis, assuming exercise in full of the warrants. the amount of permitted open market purchases is subject to increase in certain circumstances. we have purchased a total of approximately 11.5 million amerisourcebergen shares in the open market. we have funded and plan to continue funding these purchases over time. share purchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions or pursuant to instruments and plans complying with rule 10b5-1.
if we elect to exercise the two warrants issued by amerisourcebergen in full, we would, subject to the terms and conditions of such warrants, be required to make a cash payment of approximately $1.2 billion in connection with the exercise of the first warrant during a six-month period beginning in march 2016 and $1.2 billion in connection with the exercise of the second warrant during a six-month period beginning in march 2017. our ability to invest in equity in amerisourcebergen above certain thresholds is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals.
we believe that cash flow from operations, availability under our existing credit facilities and arrangements, current cash and investment balances and our ability to obtain other financing, if necessary, will provide adequate cash funds for foreseeable working capital needs, capital expenditures at existing facilities, dividend payments and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. our cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. the timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that we complete may also impact our cash requirements.
see item 7a (qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk) below for a discussion of certain financing and market risks.

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and include amounts based on management's prudent judgments and estimates. actual results may differ from these estimates. management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. to the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the statement of earnings and corresponding balance sheet accounts would be necessary. these adjustments would be made in future periods. some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment, allowance for doubtful accounts, vendor allowances, asset impairments, liability for closed locations, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes. we use the following methods to determine our estimates:
business combinations - we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. the determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.
for intangible assets, we typically use the income approach to determine fair value.  the income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the discount rates; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures. the discount rates which are applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections.
although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.
judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset's useful life as different assets will have different lives, with some assets determined to have indefinite useful lives.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment - goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. as part of our impairment analysis for each reporting unit, we engage a third party appraisal firm to assist in the determination of estimated fair value for each reporting unit. this determination includes estimating the fair value using both the income and market approaches. the income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. the market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping.
the determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete; the discount rates; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures. the allocation requires several analyses to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities including, among other things, purchased prescription files, customer relationships, pharmacy licenses and trade names. although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both.
we also compared the sum of the estimated fair values of the reporting units to the company's total value as implied by the market value of the company's equity and debt securities. this comparison indicated that, in total, our assumptions and estimates were reasonable. however, future declines in the overall market value of the company's equity and debt securities may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.
one measure of the sensitivity of the amount of goodwill impairment charges to key assumptions is the amount by which each reporting unit "passed" (fair value exceeds the carrying amount) or "failed" (the carrying amount exceeds fair value) the first step of the goodwill impairment test. our reporting units' fair values exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 12% to more than 130%. see note 9, goodwill and other intangible assets, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
our indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value is estimated by discounting the hypothetical royalty payments to their present value over the estimated economic life of the asset. these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, availability of market information as well as our profitability.
based on current knowledge, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine impairment.
allowance for doubtful accounts - the provision for bad debt is based on estimates of recoverability using both historical write-off percentages and specifically identified receivables. based on current knowledge, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine the allowance.
vendor allowances - vendor allowances are principally received as a result of purchases, sales or promotion of vendors' products. allowances are generally recorded as a reduction of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold. those allowances received for promoting vendors' products are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses to the extent of advertising incurred, with the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs. based on current knowledge, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine vendor allowances.
asset impairments - the impairment of long-lived assets is assessed based upon both qualitative and quantitative factors, including years of operation and expected future cash flows, and tested for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that a certain asset may be impaired. if the future cash flows reveal that the carrying value of the asset group may not be recoverable, an impairment charge is immediately recorded. based on current knowledge, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine asset impairments.
liability for closed locations - the liability is based on the present value of future rent obligations and other related costs (net of estimated sublease rent) to the first lease option date. based on current knowledge, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine the liability.
cost of sales and inventory - drugstore cost of sales in the retail pharmacy usa segment is derived based on point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and adjusted based on periodic inventory counts. inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the last-in, first-out ("lifo") method for the retail pharmacy usa segment and on a first-in first-out ("fifo") basis for inventory in the retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale segments except for retail inventory in the retail pharmacy international segment, which is valued using the retail method. based on current knowledge, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine cost of sales or inventory.
equity method investments - we use the equity method to account for investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. our proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings. judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material purchase and sale transactions. based on current knowledge, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for equity method investments.
- 44 -
pension and postretirement benefits - we have various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of our foreign employees. we also have postretirement healthcare plans that cover qualifying domestic employees. eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans varies depending on participants' status, date of hire and or length of service. our pension and postretirement expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating those amounts. these assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term rate of return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. in determining our long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, we consider both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long-term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio.
our policy is to fund our pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. our postretirement healthcare plans are not funded. based on current knowledge, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine pension and postretirement benefits.
income taxes - we are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. u.s. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. in evaluating the tax benefits associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. adjustments are made to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other long-term liabilities and current income taxes on our consolidated balance sheets and in income tax provision in our consolidated statements of earnings.
in determining our provision for income taxes, we use income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and enacted statutory income tax rates. the provision for income taxes also reflects our assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the united states. discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. based on current knowledge, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for income taxes.

*   recorded on balance sheet.

(1)   amounts for operating leases and capital leases do not include certain operating expenses under these leases such as common area maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes. these expenses were $437 million for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015.

(2)   purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders.

(3)   includes $297 million ($73 million in less than 1 year, $149 million in 1-3 years, $75 million in 3-5 years and none over 5 years) of unrecognized tax benefits recorded under accounting standards codification topic 740, income taxes.

the information in the foregoing table is presented as of august 31, 2015 and accordingly does not reflect obligations under agreements we entered into after that date, including the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby described under "recent development" above.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities and, except as described herein, we do not have significant exposure to any off-balance sheet arrangements. the term "off-balance sheet arrangement" generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party, under which we have: (i) any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets.
at august 31, 2015, we have issued $482 million in letters of credit, primarily related to insurance obligations. we also had $10 million of guarantees to various suppliers outstanding at august 31, 2015. the company remains secondarily liable on 71 leases. the maximum potential undiscounted future payments related to these leases was $351 million at august 31, 2015.
recent accounting pronouncements in august 2015, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update (asu) 2015-15, interest - imputation of interest (subtopic 835-30). this asu provides additional guidance on asu 2015-03, interest - imputation of interest. these asus require debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums and further specify debt issuance costs as part of line-of-credit arrangements should be treated in the manner described above. recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected. these asus are effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2015 (fiscal 2017). as permitted, the company early adopted asu 2015-03 beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. the impact of this asu reduced non-current assets and long-term debt by $20 million at august 31, 2014, respectively. this asu has no impact on the statement of earnings or statement of cash flows. the additional guidance provided in asu 2015-15 had no material financial statement impact.
in august 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-14, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606), an update to asu 2014-09. this asu amends asu 2014-09 to defer the effective date by one year for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019). early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016 (fiscal 2018). asu 2014-09 provides a new revenue recognition standard with a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. the core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. the company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance.
in july 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-11, inventory (topic 330). this asu simplifies current accounting treatments by requiring entities to measure most inventories at "the lower of cost and net realizable value" rather than using lower of cost or market. this guidance does not apply to inventories measured using last-in, first-out (lifo) method or the retail inventory method (rim). this asu is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter (fiscal 2018) with early adoption permitted. upon transition, entities must disclose the accounting change. the company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
- 46 -
in november 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-17, pushdown accounting. this asu provides companies with the option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. the election to apply pushdown accounting can be made either in the period in which the change of control occurred, or in a subsequent period. this asu is effective as of november 18, 2014. the adoption did not have a material impact on the company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
in april 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-08, reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity. this asu raises the threshold for a disposal to qualify as discontinued operations and requires new disclosures for individually material disposal transactions that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. under the new standard, companies report discontinued operations when they have a disposal that represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major impact on operations or financial results. this update will be applied prospectively and is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2014 (fiscal 2016). early adoption is permitted provided the disposal was not previously disclosed. this update will not have a material impact on the company's reported results of operations and financial position. the impact is non-cash in nature and will not affect the company's cash position.

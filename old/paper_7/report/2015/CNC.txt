revenues and revenue recognition our health plans generate revenues primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate. we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts. we generally receive premium payments and recognize premium revenue during the month in which we are obligated to provide services to our members. in some instances, our base premiums are subject to an adjustment, or risk score, based on the acuity of our membership. generally, the risk score is determined by the state analyzing submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state's membership. some contracts allow for additional premiums associated with certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries.
our contracts with states may require us to maintain a minimum health benefits ratio or may require us to share profits in excess of certain levels. in certain circumstances, our plans may be required to return premium to the state in the event profits exceed established levels. we recognize reductions in revenue in the current period for these programs. other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to receive additional or full contractual revenue. for performance-based contracts, we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance.
revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states, which is adjusted on a monthly basis by the states for retroactive additions or deletions to membership data. these eligibility adjustments are estimated monthly and subsequently adjusted in the period known. we continuously review and update those estimates as new information becomes available.  it is possible that new information could require us to make additional adjustments, which could be significant, to these estimates.
our specialty services generate revenues under contracts with state programs, healthcare organizations, and other commercial organizations, as well as from our own subsidiaries. revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services.
premium and service revenues collected in advance are recorded as unearned revenue. premium and service revenues due to us are recorded as premium and related receivables and are recorded net of an allowance based on historical trends and our management's judgment of the collectibility of these accounts. as we generally receive payments during the month in which services are provided, the allowance is typically not significant in comparison to total revenues and does not have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations.
some states enact premium taxes, similar assessments and provider and hospital pass-through payments, collectively, premium taxes, and these taxes are recorded as a component of revenues as well as operating expenses. additionally, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the affordable care act annual health insurer fee (hif). the company recognizes revenue associated with the hif on a straight line basis when we have binding agreements for the reimbursement of the fee, including the "gross-up" to reflect the hifs non-tax deductible nature. we exclude the hif and premium taxes from our key ratios as we believe they are a pass-through of costs and not indicative of our operating performance. collectively, this revenue is recorded as premium tax and hif revenue in the consolidated statement of operations.
the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) deploys a risk adjustment model that retroactively apportions medicare premiums paid according to health severity and certain demographic factors. the model pays more for members whose medical history indicates they have certain medical conditions. under this risk adjustment methodology, cms calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, physician treatment settings as well as prescription drug events. the company estimates the amount of risk adjustment based upon the diagnosis and pharmacy data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms and records revenues on a risk adjusted basis.
operating expenses medical costs medical costs include payments to physicians, hospitals, and other providers for healthcare and specialty services claims. medical costs also include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported, or ibnr, and estimates of the cost to process unpaid claims. we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required ibnr estimate. the assumptions we consider include, without limitation, claims receipt and payment experience (and variations in that experience), changes in membership, provider billing practices, healthcare service utilization trends, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, prior authorization of medical services, benefit changes, known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza, provider contract changes, changes to medicaid fee schedules, and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims.
44
our development of the ibnr estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information becomes available. as more complete information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimate, and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the changes are identified.
additionally, we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis. the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability. we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability. we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information, together with management's judgment, to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for medical costs.
while we believe our ibnr estimate is appropriate, it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates. accordingly, we cannot assure you that medical costs will not materially differ from our estimates.
results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits and to accurately estimate costs incurred. the health benefits ratio, or hbr, represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues (excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues) and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided.
cost of services cost of services expense includes the pharmaceutical costs associated with our pharmacy benefit manager and specialty pharmacy's external revenues and certain direct costs to support the functions responsible for generation of our service revenues. these expenses consist of the salaries and wages of the professionals who provide the services and associated expenses.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses, or g&a, primarily reflect wages and benefits, including stock compensation expense, and other administrative costs associated with our health plans, specialty companies and centralized functions that support all of our business units. our major centralized functions are finance, information systems and claims processing. g&a expenses also include business expansion costs, such as wages and benefits for administrative personnel, contracting costs, and information technology buildouts, incurred prior to the commencement of a new contract or health plan.
the g&a expense ratio represents g&a expenses as a percentage of premium and service revenues, and reflects the relationship between revenues earned and the costs necessary to earn those revenues.
health insurer fee the health insurer fee reflects the annual fee mandated by the aca to health insurers. the fee is determined based on our premium revenues in the previous year. each health insurer's fee is calculated by multiplying its market share by the annual fee. market share is based on commercial, medicare, and medicaid premium revenue.
other income (expense)
other income (expense) consists principally of investment income from cash and investments, earnings in equity method investments, and interest expense on debt.
discontinued operations our subsidiary, kentucky spirit health plan (kshp), ceased serving medicaid members in kentucky as of july 6, 2013. accordingly, the results of operations for kshp are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements. the following discussion and analysis is presented primarily in the context of continuing operations unless otherwise identified.

year ended december 31, 2015 compared to year ended december 31, 2014
premium and service revenues premium and service revenues increased 36% in the year ended december 31, 2015 over the corresponding period in 2014 primarily as a result of the impact from expansions or new programs in many of our states, particularly, florida, illinois, indiana, louisiana, mississippi, ohio and texas. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we received premium rate adjustments which yielded a net 1% composite change across all of our markets.
operating expenses medical costs results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits and to accurately estimate costs incurred. the health benefits ratio, or hbr, represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues (excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues) and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided. the table below depicts the hbr for our membership by member category for the year ended december 31,:
2015                                                      2014

total                                   88.9          89.3
the consolidated hbr for the year ended december 31, 2015 of 88.9% was a decrease of 40 basis points over the comparable period in 2014. the decrease compared to last year is primarily attributable to improvement in medical expense in the high acuity populations (ltc/mmp) and membership growth in medicaid expansion programs and health insurance marketplace, which operate at a lower hbr than traditional medicaid businesses.
cost of services cost of services increased by $341 million in the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. this was primarily due to growth in the acariahealth business. the cost of service ratio for the year ended december 31, 2015, was 86.4% compared to 87.1% in 2014.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses, or g&a, increased by $512 million in the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014.  this was primarily due to expenses for additional staff and facilities to support our membership growth. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded approximately $27 million of health net merger related expenses, which reduced our diluted earnings per share by $0.14.
during the first quarter of 2015, we recorded a gain of $10 million on the settlement of contingent consideration related to the chs transaction. we also recorded expense of $10 million for a contribution to our charitable foundation during the first quarter of 2015.
also during 2015, we experienced higher than anticipated opt-out rates and member attrition in the new michigan dual demonstration program, resulting in lower than expected membership and lower blended premium rates. as a result, the fair value of estimated contingent consideration was reduced from $50 million to $16 million, and we recorded a gain of $34 million in general and administrative expenses. in connection with the lower membership and revenue outlook, we conducted an impairment analysis of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, resulting in a reduction of goodwill and intangible assets of $38 million which was recorded in general and administrative expenses. the company's initial allocation of fair value resulted in goodwill and intangible assets of $52 million. at december 31, 2015, the company had goodwill of $11 million and other identifiable intangible assets of $1 million, net of $2 million of amortization, remaining on the balance sheet.

managed care premium and service revenues increased 37% in the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily as a result of expansions or new programs in many of our states, particularly florida, illinois, indiana, louisiana, mississippi, ohio and texas. earnings from operations increased $160 million between years primarily reflecting growth in the business.
specialty services premium and service revenues increased 47% in the year ended december 31, 2015, resulting primarily from increased service associated with membership growth in the managed care segment and growth in our pharmacy businesses. earnings from operations increased $81 million in the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily reflecting growth in the specialty services provided to our increased managed care membership.
year ended december 31, 2014 compared to year ended december 31, 2013
premium and service revenues premium and service revenues increased 49% in the year ended december 31, 2014 over the corresponding period in 2013 as a result of expansions in florida, ohio, washington, texas and illinois, growth in the acariahealth business, the addition of the california and new hampshire operations and our participation in the health insurance marketplaces. during the year ended december 31, 2014 we received premium rate adjustments which yielded an approximate net 1% composite increase across all of our markets.

total                                   89.3          88.6
the consolidated hbr for the year ended december 31, 2014, of 89.3% was an increase of 70 basis points over the comparable period in 2013. the increase compared to last year is primarily attributable to an increase in complex care membership over the prior year.
cost of services cost of services increased by $953 million in the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to the corresponding period in 2013. this was primarily due to the acquisition of and growth in our acariahealth business as well as the acquisition of u.s. medical management. the cost of service ratio for the year ended december 31, 2014, was 87.1% compared to 87.7% in 2013.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses, or g&a, increased by $383 million in the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to the corresponding period in 2013. this was primarily due to expenses for additional staff and facilities to support our membership growth.
the consolidated g&a expense ratio for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 was 8.4% and 8.8%, respectively. the year over year decrease in the g&a ratio reflects the leveraging of expenses over higher revenues in 2014, offset by the acquisition of u.s. medical management and start up of health insurance marketplaces which operate at higher g&a ratios.

health insurer fee during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded $126 million of non-deductible expense for the affordable care act (aca) annual health insurer fee. as of december 31, 2014, we had received signed agreements representing virtually all of the total revenue associated with the reimbursement of the aca insurer fee including the related gross-up for the associated income tax effects. as a result, we recorded $195 million in premium tax and health insurer fee revenue associated with the reimbursement of the fee.

other income (expense), net                 $(7   )         $(8   )
the increase in investment income in 2014 reflects an increase in investment balances over 2013 and improved performance of certain equity investments. interest expense increased during the year ended december 31, 2014 by $8 million reflecting the issuance of an additional $300 million in senior notes in april 2014 and a higher level of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement.
income tax expense our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2014 was 42.9% compared to 39.8% in 2013. the increase is due to the non-deductibility of the health insurer fee which increased our effective tax rate. this was partially offset by a reduction of tax expense associated with the compensation deduction limitation. during 2014, the irs issued final regulations related to the compensation deduction limitation applicable to certain health insurance providers. accordingly, we reversed previously recorded tax expense of $14 million for prior years resulting in a decrease in the effective tax rate which offset the health insurer fee impact. as a result, we no longer believe the deduction limitation applies.

cash flows provided by operating activities normal operations are funded primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.  cash flows from operating activities for 2015 were $658 million, 1.8 times net earnings, compared to $1,223 million in 2014. the cash provided by operations in 2015 and 2014 was primarily related to net earnings and an increase in medical claims liabilities resulting from growth in the business, partially offset by increases in premium and related receivables.
cash flows from operating activities for 2014 increased to $1,223 million, compared to $382 million in 2013. operating cash flows in 2014 significantly benefited from the 49% premium and service revenue growth, which resulted in increased medical claims liabilities. in addition, 2014 uniquely benefited from an increase in payables associated with various programs requiring a return of premium to state customers.  cash flows from operating activities benefited in 2013 due to an increase in net earnings and growth in our business.
cash flows from operations in each year were impacted by the timing of payments we received from our states.  states may prepay the following month premium payment, which we record as unearned revenue, or they may delay our premium payment, which we record as a receivable.  we typically receive capitation payments monthly, however the states in which we operate may decide to adjust their payment schedules which could positively or negatively impact our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period.
the reimbursement of the hif from our state customers may be settled as a separate payment or monthly in combination with our other premium payments. the vast majority of our state customers are settling the reimbursement through a separate payment after verification of each state's portion of our hif, resulting in an increase in premium and related receivables at december 31, 2015. during 2015, we paid the 2015 annual hif totaling $220 million. this negatively impacted our cash flows as we have not been reimbursed from the majority of our state customers. similarly, during 2014, we paid the 2014 annual hif invoice totaling $126 million. the table below details the impact to cash flows from operations from the timing of payments from our states ($ in millions).

our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity, preserve capital and maximize total return on invested assets within our guidelines. net cash provided by and used in investing activities will fluctuate from year to year due to the timing of investment purchases, sales and maturities. as of december 31, 2015, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed-income securities with an average duration of 2.9 years.  these securities generally are actively traded in secondary markets and the reported fair market value is determined based on recent trading activity, recent trading activity in similar securities and other observable inputs. our investment guidelines comply with the regulatory restrictions enacted in each state. we had unregulated cash and investments of $78 million at december 31, 2015, compared to $85 million at december 31, 2014.
we spent $150 million, $103 million and $68 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, on capital expenditures for system enhancements and market expansions.
cash flows provided by financing activities our financing activities provided cash of $305 million, $198 million and $154 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  financing activities in 2015, 2014 and 2013 are discussed below.
2015
during 2015, our financing activities primarily related to the proceeds from the issuance of senior debt and an additional $150 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility. in january 2015, we issued an additional $200 million of 4.75% senior notes due may 15, 2022 at par (add on notes). in connection with the january 2015 issuance, we entered into interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of $200 million (2015 swap agreements) that are scheduled to expire on may 15, 2022. under the 2015 swap agreements, we receive a fixed rate of 4.75% and pay a variable rate of libor plus a spread adjusted quarterly, which allows us to adjust the $200 million notes to a floating rate. we do not hold or issue any derivative instrument for trading or speculative purposes.
2014
in april 2014, pursuant to a shelf registration statement, we issued $300 million 4.75% senior notes due may 15, 2022 at par. interest is paid semi-annually in may and november. in connection with the issuance, we entered into $300 million notional amount of interest rate swap agreements (2014 swap agreements) that are scheduled to expire may 15, 2022. under the 2014 swap agreements, we receive a fixed rate of 4.75% and pay a variable rate of libor plus a spread adjusted quarterly, which allows us to adjust the $300 million notes to a floating rate. we do not hold or issue any derivative instrument for trading or speculative purposes.
2013
during 2013, our financing activities primarily related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility, the sale of $15 million of common stock to fund the escrow account for the acquisition of acariahealth and the repayment of a mortgage note.
in may 2013, we entered into a new unsecured $500 million revolving credit facility and terminated our previous $350 million revolving credit facility. borrowings under the agreement bear interest based upon libor rates, the federal funds rate or the prime rate. the agreement has a maturity date of june 1, 2018, provided it will mature 90 days prior to the maturity date of the 5.75% senior notes due 2017 if such notes are not refinanced (or extended) or certain financial conditions are not met, including carrying $100 million of unrestricted cash on deposit.
52
liquidity metrics the $500 million revolving credit agreement contains non-financial and financial covenants, including requirements of minimum fixed charge coverage ratios, maximum debt-to-ebitda ratios and minimum tangible net worth. we are required not to exceed a maximum debt-to-ebitda ratio of 3.0 to 1.0. as of december 31, 2015, we had $225 million in borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, and we were in compliance with all covenants. as of december 31, 2015, there were no limitations on the availability under the revolving credit agreement as a result of the debt-to-ebitda ratio.
we had outstanding letters of credit of $47 million as of december 31, 2015, which were not part of our revolving credit facility. we also had letters of credit for $50 million (valued at the december 31, 2015 conversion rate), or €46 million, representing our proportional share of the letters of credit issued to support ribera salud's outstanding debt which are a part of the revolving credit facility. collectively, the letters of credit bore interest at 1.55% as of december 31, 2015. in addition, we had outstanding surety bonds of $305 million as of december 31, 2015.
the indenture governing our senior notes contains non-financial and financial covenants, including requirements of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio.
at december 31, 2015, we had working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of negative $24 million, compared to $51 million at december 31, 2014.  we manage our short term and long term investments with the goal of ensuring that a sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid and can be sold to fund short term requirements as needed.
at december 31, 2015, our debt to capital ratio, defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and total equity, was 36.0%, compared to 33.5% at december 31, 2014.  excluding the $67 million non-recourse mortgage note, our debt to capital ratio was 34.7% as of december 31, 2015, compared to 31.7% at december 31, 2014.  we utilize the debt to capital ratio as a measure, among others, of our leverage and financial flexibility.
we have a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to 8 million shares of common stock from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. we have 3 million available shares remaining under the program for repurchases as of december 31, 2015. no duration has been placed on the repurchase program. we reserve the right to discontinue the repurchase program at any time. we did not make any repurchases under this plan during 2015, 2014 or 2013.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we received dividends of $11 million, $50 million, and $18 million, respectively, from our regulated subsidiaries.
2016 expectations in early 2016, we expect to complete the merger with health net, a publicly traded managed care organization that delivers health care services through health plans and government-sponsored managed care plans, for approximately $5.5 billion. in connection with the upcoming closing of the merger, in february 2016, our wholly owned unrestricted subsidiary (escrow issuers) issued approximately $1.4 billion 5.625% senior notes due 2021 at par and $1.0 billion 6.125% senior notes due 2024 at par. the transaction will be financed through a combination of borrowings on our revolving credit facility, existing cash on hand, the $2.4 billion february debt issuance, and approximately $2.8 billion in shares of centene common stock. the proceeds of the debt issuance will be held in escrow until the closing of the health net merger. if the health net merger is not consummated, the escrow issuer will be required to redeem each series of notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such series of notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.
upon execution of the merger agreement, the company negotiated the terms of a new unsecured $1,000 million revolving credit facility with its banking syndicate. the new $1,000 million revolving credit facility is effective upon the closing of the merger and the existing $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility will be terminated simultaneously.
including the effects of potential contributions and expenditures related to health net, we expect to make net capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries of approximately $250 million during 2016 associated with our growth and spend approximately $330 million in additional capital expenditures primarily associated with system enhancements, integration, and market expansions. these capital contributions are expected to be funded by unregulated cash flow generation in 2016 and borrowings on our revolving credit facility.
53
in january 2016, the company announced an ongoing comprehensive internal search for six hard drives that were unaccounted for in its inventory of approximately 26,000 information technology (it) devices.  this incident resulted from an employee not following established procedures on storing it hardware.  in the process of completing its investigation, in february 2016, the company received an admission from an employee to placing the six hard drives in a locked receptacle for secure destruction. as a result, the company satisfied itself and concluded its investigation.
based on our operating plan, we expect that our available cash, cash equivalents and investments, cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our general operations and capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of this filing.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes future contractual obligations. these obligations contain estimates and are subject to revision under a number of circumstances. our debt consists of borrowings from our senior notes, credit facility, mortgages and capital leases. the purchase obligations consist primarily of software purchases and maintenance contracts. the contractual obligations and estimated period of payment over the next five years and beyond are as follows (in millions):

________________________________
1 our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2015, includes $170 million of other long term liabilities. this consists primarily of long term deferred income taxes, liabilities under our deferred compensation plan, and reserves for uncertain tax positions. these liabilities have been excluded from the table above as the timing and/or amount of any cash payment is uncertain.
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries.  as managed care organizations, these subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing, payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us.  generally, the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity's level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus.
our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate.  as of december 31, 2015, our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $2,284 million, compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of $1,195 million.  during the year ended december 31, 2015, we contributed $643 million of statutory capital to our subsidiaries. we estimate our risk based capital, or rbc, percentage (including kshp) to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level.
the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted rules which set minimum risk-based capital requirements for insurance companies, managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage.  as of december 31, 2015, each of our health plans was in compliance with the risk-based capital requirements enacted in those states.

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2, summary of significant accounting policies, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. our accounting policies regarding medical claims liability and intangible assets are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management. as a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors.
medical claims liability our medical claims liability includes claims reported but not yet paid, or inventory, estimates for claims incurred but not reported, or ibnr, and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period.  we estimate our medical claims liability using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice.  these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors.
actuarial standards of practice generally require that the medical claims liability estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions.  moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate.  in many situations, the claims amounts ultimately settled will be different than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice. we include in our ibnr an estimate for medical claims liability under moderately adverse conditions which represents the risk of adverse deviation of the estimates in our actuarial method of reserving.
we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates. the assumptions we consider when estimating ibnr include, without limitation, claims receipt and payment experience (and variations in that experience), changes in membership, provider billing practices, healthcare service utilization trends, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, prior authorization of medical services, benefit changes, known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza, provider contract changes, changes to fee schedules, and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims.
we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated.  for more recent periods, incurred non-inpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors.  incurred hospital inpatient claims are estimated based on known inpatient utilization data and prior claims experience adjusted for known factors.  for older periods, we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates.  the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been received or adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs.  when we commence operations in a new state or region, we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability.  see "risk factors - failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows." these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented.
additionally, we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis. the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability. we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability. we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information, together with management's judgment, to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for claims.
our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims receipts and payment information becomes available. as more complete claims information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates, and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the changes are identified. in every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with previously reported periods. we consistently apply our reserving methodology from period to period. as additional information becomes known to us, we adjust our actuarial models accordingly to establish medical claims liability estimates.
55
the paid and received completion factors, claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate.  the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december 31, 2015 data:

while we believe our estimates are appropriate, it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates.  for example, a 1% increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liability would have affected net earnings by $14 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, excluding the effect of any return of premium, risk corridor, or minimum medical loss ratio programs.  the estimates are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our providers and information available from other outside sources.

medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider.  as a result, the liability generally is described as having a "short-tail," which causes less than 5% of our medical claims liability as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year.  we believe that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liability as of december 31, 2015 will be known by the end of 2016.
changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years are primarily attributable to reserving under moderately adverse conditions. additionally, as a result of minimum hbr and other return of premium programs, approximately $47 million, $26 million and $0 million of the "incurred related to: prior period" was recorded as a reduction to premium revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. further, claims processing initiatives yielded increased claim payment recoveries and coordination of benefits related to prior year dates of service. changes in medical utilization and cost trends and the effect of medical management initiatives may also contribute to changes in medical claim liability estimates.  while we have evidence that medical management initiatives are effective on a case by case basis, medical management initiatives primarily focus on events and behaviors prior to the incurrence of the medical event and generation of a claim. accordingly, any change in behavior, leveling of care, or coordination of treatment occurs prior to claim generation and as a result, the costs prior to the medical management initiative are not known by us. additionally, certain medical management initiatives are focused on member and provider education with the intent of influencing behavior to appropriately align the medical services provided with the member's acuity. in these cases, determining whether the medical management initiative changed the behavior cannot be determined. because of the complexity of our business, the number of states in which we operate, and the volume of claims that we process, we are unable to practically quantify the impact of these initiatives on our changes in estimates of ibnr.
the following are examples of medical management initiatives that may have contributed to the favorable development through lower medical utilization and cost trends:
•   appropriate leveling of care for neonatal intensive care unit hospital admissions, other inpatient hospital admissions, and observation admissions, in accordance with interqual or other criteria.
•   management of our pre-authorization list and more stringent review of durable medical equipment and injectibles.
•   emergency room program designed to collaboratively work with hospitals to steer non-emergency care away from the costly emergency room setting (through patient education, on-site alternative urgent care settings, etc.)
•   increase emphasis on case management and clinical rounding where case managers are nurses or social workers who are employed by the health plan to assist selected patients with the coordination of healthcare services in order to meet a patient's specific healthcare needs.
•   incorporation of disease management which is a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, collaborative approach to chronic illnesses such as asthma.
•   prenatal and infant health programs utilized in our start smart for your baby outreach service.
goodwill and intangible assets we have made several acquisitions that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets. these intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, purchased contract rights, provider contracts, trade names and goodwill. at december 31, 2015, we had $842 million of goodwill and $155 million of other intangible assets.
intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the following periods:
intangible asset            amortization period purchased contract rights          5 - 15 years provider contracts                 4 - 15 years customer relationships             3 - 15 years trade names                        7 - 20 years developed technology                    5 years
57
our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be impaired, the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset. our management must make assumptions and estimates, such as the discount factor, future utility and other internal and external factors, in determining the estimated fair values. while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate, other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results.
goodwill is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment. in addition, an impairment analysis of intangible assets would be performed based on other factors. these factors include significant changes in membership, state funding, medical contracts and provider networks and contracts.
58
we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. we generally do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. however, in certain circumstances, such as recent acquisitions, we may elect to perform a quantitative assessment without first assessing qualitative factors. the fair value of all reporting units with material amounts of goodwill was substantially in excess of the carrying value as of our annual impairment testing date, with the exception of reporting units that were recently acquired without excess fair value on the acquisition date.

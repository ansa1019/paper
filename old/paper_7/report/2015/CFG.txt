management's discussion and analysis overview we are one of the nation's oldest and largest financial institutions, with $138.2 billion of total assets as of december 31, 2015. headquartered in providence, rhode island, we deliver a broad range of retail and commercial banking products and services to individuals, institutions and companies. our approximately 17,700 colleagues strive to meet the financial needs of customers and prospects through approximately 1,200 branches and approximately 3,200 atms operated in 11 states in the new england, mid-atlantic and midwest regions and through our online, telephone and mobile banking platforms. we conduct our banking operations through two wholly-owned banking subsidiaries, citizens bank, n.a. and citizens bank of pennsylvania.
we operate our business through two operating segments: consumer banking and commercial banking. consumer banking accounted for $51.5 billion and $47.7 billion, or approximately 53% of our average loan and lease balances (including loans held for sale) for both the year ended december 31, 2015 and 2014. consumer banking serves retail customers and small businesses with annual revenues of up to $25 million with products and services that include deposit products, mortgage and home equity lending, student loans, auto financing, credit cards, business loans and wealth management and investment services.
commercial banking accounted for $41.6 billion and $37.7 billion, or approximately 43% and 42% of our average loan and lease balances (including loans held for sale) for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. commercial banking offers corporate, institutional and not-for-profit clients a full range of wholesale banking products and services including lending and deposits, capital markets, treasury services, foreign exchange and interest hedging, leasing and asset finance, specialty finance and trade finance.
as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $2.3 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, of non-core asset balances, which were included in other along with our treasury function, securities portfolio, wholesale funding activities, goodwill, community development assets and other unallocated assets, liabilities, capital, revenues, provision for credit losses and expenses not attributed to the consumer banking or commercial banking segments. non-core assets are primarily loans inconsistent with our strategic goals, generally as a result of geographic location, industry, product type or risk level. we have actively managed these assets down since they were designated as non-core on june 30, 2009; this portfolio has decreased by an additional 25% as of december 31, 2015 compared to december 31, 2014. the largest component of our non-core portfolio is our home equity products serviced by others (a portion of which we now service internally).

management's discussion and analysis key factors affecting our business macro-economic conditions our business is affected by national and regional economic conditions, as well as the perception of future conditions and economic prospects. the significant macro-economic factors that impact our business include interest rates, the health of the housing market, the rate of the u.s.'s economic expansion, and unemployment levels.
the u.s. economy continued to expand at a moderate pace, with real gdp rising by 2.4% in 2015, following 2.4% growth in 2014. growth in household spending has declined and the housing sector has slowed as well with the three month average of existing home sales falling to 5.2 million units from 5.5 million units in the previous quarter. business fixed investment and net exports remained soft.
the labor market continued to improve, with moderate job gains and declining unemployment. the u.s. unemployment rate dropped to 5.0% at december 31, 2015 from 5.6% at december 31, 2014. average monthly nonfarm employment increased by 228,000 in 2015, after increasing a revised 251,000 in 2014.
the frb maintained very accommodative monetary policy conditions during 2015, notwithstanding the small 25 bps rate increase in december, and continues to target a 0.25% to 0.50% federal funds rate range at the short end of the yield curve. interest rates remain relatively low. see "-interest rates" below for further discussion of the impact of interest rates on our results. observable inflation levels remain below the frb's longer-term objective of 2%. further labor market improvement and the dissipation of the effects of a decline in energy and import prices are expected to bring inflation closer to the frb's inflation objective.
credit trends credit trends remained favorable in 2015 with a year-over-year reduction in both net charge-offs and nonperforming loans. net charge-offs in 2015 of $284 million decreased $39 million from $323 million in 2014, driven by favorable credit conditions and higher recoveries. annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total average loans improved to 0.30% in 2015, compared to 0.36% in 2014. asset quality remained strong and within expectations.
interest rates net interest income is our largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interest-earning assets (usually loans and investment securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (usually deposits and borrowings). the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of interest-earning assets, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities and the spread between the contractual yield on such assets and the contractual cost of such liabilities. these factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the frb and market interest rates. for further discussion, refer to "-risk governance" and "-market risk - non-trading risk."
the cost of our deposits and short-term wholesale borrowings is largely based on short-term interest rates, which are primarily driven by the frb's actions. however, the yields generated by our loans and securities are typically driven by both short-term and long-term interest rates, which are set by the market or, at times, by the frb's actions. the level of net interest income is therefore influenced by movements in such interest rates and the pace at which such movements occur. in 2014 and 2015, short-term and long-term interest rates remained at very low levels by historical standards, with many benchmark rates, such as the federal funds rate and one- and three-month libor, near zero. further declines in the yield curve or a decline in longer-term yields relative to short-term yields (a flatter yield curve) would have an adverse impact on our net interest margin and net interest income.
in 2014 and 2015, the frb maintained a highly accommodative monetary policy, and indicated that this policy would remain in effect for a considerable time after its asset purchase program ended on october 29, 2014 and the economic recovery strengthens in the united states. more recently, the frb has started to move down the path of interest rate normalization by raising the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. however, the frb will likely continue to target a highly accommodative monetary policy for some time to come. as of december 31, 2015, the frb had ended its asset purchases of treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. however, until further notice, the frb will continue to re-invest run off from its $1.7 trillion mortgage-backed portfolio.

management's discussion and analysis regulatory trends we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision, which continue to evolve as the legal and regulatory framework governing our operations continues to change. the current operating environment also has heightened regulatory expectations around many regulations including consumer compliance, the bank secrecy act, anti-money laundering compliance, and increased internal audit activities. as a result of these heightened expectations, we expect to incur additional costs for additional compliance personnel and/or professional fees associated with advisors and consultants.
dodd-frank regulation as described under "regulation and supervision" in part i, item 1 - business included elsewhere in this report, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including the dodd-frank act. the dodd-frank act is complex, and many aspects of the dodd-frank act are subject to final rulemaking or phased implementation that will take effect over several years. the dodd-frank act will continue to impact our earnings through fee reductions, higher costs and imposition of new restrictions on us. the dodd-frank act may also continue to have a material adverse impact on the value of certain assets and liabilities held on our balance sheet. the ultimate impact of the dodd-frank act on our business will depend on regulatory interpretation and rulemaking as well as the success of any of our actions to mitigate the negative impacts of certain provisions. key parts of the dodd-frank act that specifically impact our business are the repeal of a previous prohibition against payment of interest on demand deposits, which became effective in july 2011, and the introduction of a capital planning and stress-testing framework developed by the frbg, known as ccar and dfast. the dfast process projects net income, loan losses and capital ratios during a nine-quarter horizon under hypothetical, stressful macroeconomic and financial market scenarios developed by the frbg as well as certain mandated assumptions about capital distributions prescribed in the dfast rule.
in march and july of 2015 we published estimated impacts of stress, as required by applicable regulation processes, which may be accessed on our regulatory filings and disclosures page on http://investor.citizensbank.com. in 2016, we will publish the disclosure requirements in june and october. consistent with the purpose of these exercises and the assumptions used to assess our performance during hypothetical economic conditions, the projected results under the required stress scenarios show severe negative impacts on earnings. however, these pro forma results should not be interpreted to be management expectations in light of the current economic and operating environment. during march 2015, the federal reserve also published results from the latest supervisory stress tests performed for and by large bank holding companies supervised by the federal reserve (see frb website). in 2016, the federal reserve is expected to publish results from the 2016 supervisory stress test performed for and by large bank holding companies supervised by the federal reserve in june. these tests are conducted and published by the frb annually in fulfillment of ccar and dfast requirements.
comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar is an annual exercise by the frbg to ensure that the largest bank holding companies have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress and robust forward-looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks.
as part of ccar, the frbg evaluates institutions' capital adequacy, internal capital adequacy assessment processes and their plans to make capital distributions, such as dividend payments or stock repurchases. the frbg may either object to our capital plan, in whole or in part, or provide a notice of non-objection. if the frbg objects to our capital plan, we may not make any capital distribution other than those with respect to which the frbg has indicated its non-objection.
in march 2015, the frbg assessed our current capital plan as submitted and documented under the ccar process and raised no objection to the plan. unless we choose to file an amended capital plan prior to april 2016, the maximum levels at which we may declare dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock through june 30, 2016 are governed by our 2015 capital plan, subject to actual financial performance and ongoing compliance with internal governance and all other regulatory requirements.
for subsequent cycles, beginning in 2016, bhcs will be required to submit their annual capital plans and stress testing results to the federal reserve on or before april 5.
repeal of the prohibition on depository institutions paying interest on demand deposits we began offering interest-bearing corporate checking accounts after the 2011 repeal of the prohibition on depository institutions paying interest on demand deposits. currently, industrywide interest rates for this product are very low and thus far the impact of the repeal has not had a significant effect on our results. however, market rates could increase more significantly in the future. if we need to pay higher interest rates on checking accounts to maintain current clients or attract new clients, our interest expense would increase, perhaps materially. furthermore, if we fail to offer interest rates at a sufficient level to retain demand deposits, our core deposits may be reduced, which would require us to obtain funding in other ways or limit potential future asset growth.

management's discussion and analysis basel iii final rules applicable to us and our banking subsidiaries in july 2013, the frb, occ, and fdic issued the u.s. basel iii final rules. the rules implement the committee on banking supervision's basel iii capital framework and certain provisions of the dodd-frank act, including the collins amendment. the u.s. basel iii final rules substantially revised the risked-based capital and leverage requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their insured depository institution subsidiaries, including cbna and cbpa. the u.s. basel iii final rules became effective for cfg and its depository institution subsidiaries, including cbna and cbpa, on january 1, 2015 (subject to a phase-in period for certain provisions). in order to comply with the new capital requirements, we established internal capital ratio targets that meet or exceed u.s. regulatory expectations under fully phased-in basel iii rules, and increased our capital requirements in anticipation of the transition that is underway.
heloc payment shock attention has been given by regulators, rating agencies, and the general press regarding the potential for increased exposure to credit losses associated with helocs that were originated during the period of rapid home price appreciation between 2003 and 2007. industrywide, many of the helocs originated during this timeframe were structured with an extended interest-only payment period followed by a requirement to convert to a higher payment amount that would begin fully amortizing both principal and interest beginning at a certain date in the future. as of december 31, 2015, approximately 29% of our $15.1 billion heloc portfolio, or $4.4 billion in drawn balances were subject to a payment reset or balloon payment between january 1, 2016 and december 31, 2018, including $80 million in balloon balances where full payment is due at the end of a ten-year interest only draw period.
to help manage this exposure, in september 2013 we launched a comprehensive program designed to provide heightened customer outreach to inform, educate and assist customers through the reset process as well as to offer alternative financing and forbearance options. results indicate that our efforts to assist customers at risk of default have successfully reduced delinquency and charge-off rates compared to our original expectations.
as of december 31, 2015, for the $1.6 billion of our heloc portfolio that was originally structured with a reset period in 2013 and 2014, 94% of the balances were refinanced, paid off or were current on payments, 3% were past due and 3% had been charged off. as of december 31, 2015, for the $1.3 billion in balances originally structured with a reset period in 2015, 94% of the balances were refinanced, paid off or were current on payments, 5% were past due and 1% had been charged off. a total of $995 million of these balances are scheduled to reset in 2016. factors that affect our future expectations for charge-off risk for the portion of our heloc portfolio subject to reset periods in the future include improved loan-to-value ratios resulting from continued home price appreciation, stable portfolio credit score profiles and more robust loss mitigation efforts.
factors affecting comparability of our results goodwill during the 19-year period from 1988 to 2007, we completed a series of more than 25 acquisitions of other financial institutions and financial assets and liabilities. we accounted for these types of business combinations using the purchase method of accounting. under this accounting method, the acquired company's net assets are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, and the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
under relevant accounting guidance, we are required to review goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of any of our business units might be less than its carrying value. the valuation of goodwill is dependent on forward-looking expectations related to the performance of the u.s. economy and our associated financial performance.
the prolonged delay in the full recovery of the u.s. economy, and the impact of that delay on our earnings expectations, prompted us to record a $4.4 billion pre-tax ($4.1 billion after-tax) goodwill impairment as of june 30, 2013 related to our consumer banking reporting unit. for segment reporting purposes, the impairment charge is reflected in other.
although the u.s. economy had at the time demonstrated signs of recovery, notably improvements in unemployment and housing, the pace and extent of recovery in these indicators, as well as in overall gross domestic product, lagged behind previous expectations. the impact of the slow recovery was most evident in consumer banking. the forecasted lower economic growth for the united states, coupled with increasing costs of complying with the new regulatory framework in the financial industry, resulted in a deceleration of expected growth for consumer banking's future income, which resulted in our recording of a goodwill impairment charge during the second quarter of 2013. we have recorded goodwill impairment charges in the past, most recently in 2013, and any further impairment to our goodwill could materially affect our results in any given period. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, we had a carrying value of goodwill of $6.9 billion. for additional information regarding our goodwill impairment testing, see note 1 "significant accounting policies" and note 9 "goodwill" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included elsewhere in this report.

management's discussion and analysis investment in our business we regularly incur expenses associated with investments in our infrastructure. for example, from 2010 to 2015 we invested $1.6 billion in infrastructure and technology, and plan to invest a total of $245 million in 2016 and about $160 million in 2017. we invested $219 million in our infrastructure in 2015. these investments, which are designed to lower our operating costs and improve our customer experience, include significant programs to enhance our resiliency, upgrade customer-facing technology and streamline operations. recent significant investments included the 2013 launch of our new teller system, new commercial loan platform and new auto loan platform and the 2013 upgrade of the majority of our atm network, including equipping more than 1,450 atms with advanced deposit-taking functionality as well as additional investment in our treasury solutions platform in 2014. in the third quarter of 2015 we enhanced our data resiliency via a new back up data center and began rolling out a new mortgage platform. we expect that these investments will increase our long-term overall efficiency and add to our capacity to increase revenue.
operating expenses to operate as a fully independent public company as part of our transition to a fully independent public company, we incurred cumulative one-time expenditures of approximately $52 million through the end of 2015, including capitalized costs of approximately $14 million, as well as ongoing incremental expenses of approximately $34 million per year. these ongoing costs include higher local charges associated with exiting worldwide vendor relationships and incremental expenses to support information technology, compliance, corporate governance, regulatory, financial and risk infrastructure that are necessary to enable us to operate as a fully independent public company.
principal components of operations and key performance metrics used by management as a banking institution, we manage and evaluate various aspects of our results of operations and our financial condition. we evaluate the levels and trends of the line items included in our balance sheet and statement of operations, as well as various financial ratios that are commonly used in our industry. we analyze these ratios and financial trends against our own historical performance, our budgeted performance and the financial condition and performance of comparable banking institutions in our region and nationally.
the primary line items we use in our key performance metrics to manage and evaluate our statement of operations include net interest income, noninterest income, total revenue, provision for credit losses, noninterest expense and net income (loss). the primary line items we use in our key performance metrics to manage and evaluate our balance sheet data include loans and leases, securities, allowance for credit losses, deposits, borrowed funds and derivatives.
net interest income net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on interest-earning assets (usually loans and investment securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (usually deposits and borrowings). the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of interest-earning assets, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities and the spread between the contractual yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. net interest income is impacted by the relative mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, movements in market interest rates, levels of nonperforming assets and pricing pressure from competitors. the mix of interest-earning assets is influenced by loan demand and by management's continual assessment of the rate of return and relative risk associated with various classes of interest-earning assets.
the mix of interest-bearing liabilities is influenced by management's assessment of the need for lower cost funding sources weighed against relationships with customers and growth requirements and is impacted by competition for deposits in our market and the availability and pricing of other sources of funds.
noninterest income the primary components of our noninterest income are service charges and fees, card fees, trust and investment services fees and mortgage banking fees.
total revenue total revenue is the sum of our net interest income and our noninterest income.
provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses is the amount of expense that, based on our judgment, is required to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an amount that reflects probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and that, in management's judgment, is appropriate under relevant accounting guidance. the provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses as well as the provision for unfunded commitments. the determination of the amount of the allowance for credit losses is complex and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity. for additional information regarding the provision for credit losses, see "-critical

noninterest expense noninterest expense includes salaries and employee benefits, outside services, occupancy expense, equipment expense, amortization of software, goodwill impairment, and other operating expenses.
net income (loss)
we evaluate our net income (loss) based on measures including return on average common equity, return on average total assets and return on average tangible common equity.
loans and leases we classify our loans and leases pursuant to the following classes: commercial, commercial real estate, leases, residential mortgages, home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, home equity loans serviced by others, home equity lines of credit serviced by others, automobile, student, credit cards and other retail.
loans are reported at the amount of their outstanding principal, net of charge-offs, unearned income, deferred loan origination fees and costs and unamortized premiums or discounts (on purchased loans). deferred loan origination fees and costs and purchase discounts and premiums are amortized as an adjustment of yield over the life of the loan, using the level yield interest method. unamortized amounts remaining upon prepayment or sale are recorded as interest income or gain (loss) on sale, respectively. credit card receivables include billed and uncollected interest and fees.
leases are classified at the inception of the lease by type. lease receivables, including leveraged leases, are reported at the aggregate of lease payments receivable and estimated residual values, net of unearned and deferred income, including unamortized investment credits. lease residual values are reviewed at least annually for other-than-temporary impairment, with valuation adjustments recognized currently against noninterest income. leveraged leases are reported net of non-recourse debt. unearned income is recognized to yield a level rate of return on the net investment in the leases.
mortgage loans and commercial loans held for sale are carried at fair value.
securities our securities portfolio is managed to seek return while maintaining prudent levels of quality, market risk and liquidity. investments in debt and equity securities are carried in four portfolios: afs, htm, trading securities and other investment securities. we determine the appropriate classification at the time of purchase. securities in our afs portfolio will be held for indefinite periods of time and may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, changes in prepayment risk or other factors relevant to our asset and liability strategy. securities in our afs portfolio are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in oci, as a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of taxes. securities are classified as htm because we have the ability and intent to hold the securities to maturity, and securities in our htm portfolio are carried at amortized cost. other investment securities are composed mainly of fhlb stock and frb stock (which are carried at cost), and money market mutual fund investments held by the company's broker-dealer (which are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in noninterest income).
allowance for credit losses our estimate of probable losses in the loan and lease portfolios is recorded in the alll and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. together these are referred to as the allowance for credit losses. we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses using the following ratios: alll as a percentage of total loans and leases; alll as a percentage of nonperforming loans and leases; and nonperforming loans and leases as a percentage of total loans and leases. for additional information, see "-critical accounting estimates - allowance for credit losses," and note 1 "significant accounting policies" and note 5 "allowance for credit losses, nonperforming assets and concentrations of credit risk" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included elsewhere in this report.
deposits our deposits include: on demand checking, checking with interest, regular savings accounts, money market accounts and term deposits.

management's discussion and analysis borrowed funds as of december 31, 2015, our total short-term borrowed funds included federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreement to repurchase, the current portion of fhlb advances and other short-term borrowed funds. as of december 31, 2015, our long-term borrowed funds included subordinated debt, unsecured notes, federal home loan advances and other long-term borrowed funds. for additional information, see "-analysis of financial condition - borrowed funds," and note 12 "borrowed funds" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included elsewhere in this report.
derivatives we use pay-fixed swaps to lengthen liabilities synthetically and offset duration in fixed-rate assets. we also use pay-fixed swaps to hedge floating-rate wholesale funding.
we use receive-fixed interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate exposure on our medium term borrowings. we also use receive-fixed swaps to minimize the exposure to variability in the interest cash flows on our floating rate assets. the assets and liabilities recorded for derivatives designated as hedges reflect the market value of these hedge instruments.
we sell interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forwards to commercial customers. offsetting swap and forward agreements are simultaneously transacted to minimize our market risk associated with the customer derivative contracts. the assets and liabilities recorded for derivatives not designated as hedges reflect the market value of these transactions. for additional information, see "-analysis of financial condition - derivatives," and note 16 "derivatives" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included elsewhere in this report.
key performance metrics and non-gaap financial measures we consider various measures when evaluating our performance and making day-to-day operating decisions, as well as evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including:
•   return on average common equity, which we define as net income (loss) available to common stockholders divided by average common equity;
•   return on average tangible common equity, which we define as net income (loss) available to common stockholders divided by average common equity excluding average goodwill (net of related deferred tax liability) and average other intangibles;
•   return on average total assets, which we define as net income (loss) divided by average total assets;
•   return on average total tangible assets, which we define as net income (loss) divided by average total assets excluding average goodwill (net of related deferred tax liability) and average other intangibles;
•   efficiency ratio, which we define as the ratio of our total noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and total noninterest income. we measure our efficiency ratio to evaluate the efficiency of our operations as it helps us monitor how costs are changing compared to our income. a decrease in our efficiency ratio represents improvement; and
•   net interest margin, which we calculate by dividing annualized net interest income for the period by average total interest-earning assets, is a key measure that we use to evaluate our net interest income.
certain of the above financial measures, including return on average tangible common equity, return on average total tangible assets and the efficiency ratio are not recognized under gaap. in addition, we present net income (loss), net income (loss) available to common stockholders, and return on average tangible common equity,and efficiency ratio net of goodwill impairment restructuring charges and special items. we believe these non-gaap measures provide useful information to investors because these are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions. in addition, we believe restructuring charges and special items in any period do not reflect the operational performance of the business in that period and, accordingly, it is useful to consider these line items with and without restructuring charges and special items. we believe this presentation also increases comparability of period-to-period results.
we consider pro forma capital ratios defined by banking regulators but not effective at each period end to be non-gaap financial measures. as analysts and banking regulators may evaluate our capital adequacy using these pro forma ratios, we believe they are useful to provide investors the ability to evaluate our capital adequacy on the same basis.
other companies may use similarly titled non-gaap financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. accordingly, our non-gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. we caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-gaap measures, but instead to consider them with the most directly comparable gaap measure. non-gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under gaap.

management's discussion and analysis results of operations - year ended december 31, 2015 compared with year ended december 31, 2014
highlights for the year ended december 31, 2015:
•   net income of $840 million decreased $25 million, compared to $865 million in 2014;
•   net income included $31 million in after-tax restructuring charges and special noninterest expense items, compared with a net $180 million after-tax gain related to the chicago divestiture and $105 million after-tax in restructuring charges and special noninterest expense items in 2014. excluding the restructuring charges and special items, net income increased $81 million, or 10%, to $871 million,(1) from $790 million(1) in 2014;
•   net income available to common stockholders of $833 million decreased $32 million, compared to $865 million in 2014. excluding the impact of the chicago divestiture gain, restructuring charges and special items net income available to common stockholders of $864 million(1) increased $74 million, or 9%, from 2014.
•   net interest income of $3.4 billion increased $101 million, or 3%, from $3.3 billion in 2014, as the benefit of earning asset growth and a reduction in pay-fixed swap costs was partially offset by continued pressure from the relatively persistent low-rate environment on loan yields and mix, the effect of the chicago divestiture, higher borrowing costs related to debt issuances, and higher deposit costs;
•   net interest margin of 2.75% decreased 8 basis points, compared to 2.83% in 2014, given the impact of the continued low-rate environment on loan yields and mix, higher borrowing costs related to the issuance of subordinated debt and senior notes, higher deposit costs and the impact of the chicago divestiture;
•   noninterest income of $1.4 billion decreased $256 million, or 15%, compared to $1.7 billion in 2014, which included a $288 million pre-tax gain related to the chicago divestiture. excluding the chicago divestiture gain, noninterest income increased $32 million, or 2%, as higher mortgage banking fees, bank-owned life insurance income, other income, and service charges and fees were partially offset by lower foreign exchange and trade finance fees, capital markets fees, trust and investment services fees and card fees;
•   noninterest expense of $3.3 billion was down $133 million, or 4%, compared to $3.4 billion in 2014 driven by a $119 million decrease in restructuring charges and special items, and the impact of the chicago divestiture as investments to drive future growth were offset by the benefit of efficiency initiatives;
•   provision for credit losses totaled $302 million, down $17 million, or 5%, from $319 million in 2014, reflecting continued improvement in credit quality. results in 2015 included a net provision build of $18 million compared with a net $4 million release in 2014;
•   return on average tangible common equity ratio of 6.45%(1) compared to 6.71%(1) for 2014. excluding the impact of restructuring charges and special items mentioned above, our return on average tangible common equity improved to 6.69%(1) from 6.13%(1) in 2014;
•   average loans and leases of $96.2 billion increased $7.1 billion, or 8%, from $89.0 billion in 2014, driven by commercial loan growth and growth in auto, residential mortgage, and student loans, partially offset by a decrease in home equity balances and a reduction in the non-core loan portfolio;
•   average interest-bearing deposits of $72.5 billion increased $8.1 billion, or 13%, from $64.4 billion (excluding deposits held for sale) in 2014, driven by growth in all deposit products;
•   net charge-offs of $284 million decreased $39 million, or 12%, from $323 million in 2014 reflecting continued improvement in credit quality. the alll of $1.2 billion increased $21 million compared to year end 2014. alll to total loans and leases was 1.23% as of december 31, 2015, compared with 1.28% as of december 31, 2014. alll to non-performing loans and leases ratio was 115% as of december 31, 2015, compared with 109% as of december 31, 2014; and
•   net income per average common share, basic and diluted, was $1.55 for 2015, which was unchanged from 2014 due to the impact on 2015 earnings per share of a $7 million preferred stock dividend.

management's discussion and analysis net income net income totaled $840 million in 2015, down $25 million, or 3%, from $865 million in 2014, driven by a $106 million after-tax decrease in restructuring charges and special items. 2015 results included $31 million of after-tax restructuring charges. 2014 results included the benefit of a $180 million after-tax gain related to the chicago divestiture and $105 million of after-tax restructuring charges related to our separation from rbs and enhanced efficiencies across the organization. excluding the restructuring charges and special items, net income increased $81 million, or 10%, from 2014, driven by a pre-tax $133 million increase in revenue and a pre-tax $14 million decrease in noninterest expense.

(1) our sbo portfolio consists of purchased home equity loans and lines that were originally serviced by others. we now service a portion of this portfolio internally.
(2) balances are net of certain short-term receivables associated with reverse repurchase agreements. interest expense includes the full cost of the repurchase agreements and certain hedging costs. the rate on federal funds purchased is elevated due to the impact from pay-fixed interest rate swaps that are scheduled to run off by the end of 2016. see "-analysis of financial condition - december 31, 2015 compared with december 31, 2014 - derivatives" for further information.

management's discussion and analysis net interest income of $3.4 billion in 2015 increased $101 million, or 3%, compared to $3.3 billion in 2014, as the benefit of earning asset growth and a reduction in pay-fixed swap costs was partially offset by continued pressure from the relatively persistent low-rate environment on loan yields and mix, higher borrowing costs related to debt issuances, and higher deposit costs.
average interest-earning assets increased $6.8 billion, or 6%, from 2014 due to a $3.9 billion increase in average commercial loans and leases, and a $3.2 billion increase in average retail loans as growth in auto, mortgage, and student loan balances, were partially offset by lower home equity outstandings, and a reduction in the non-core loan portfolio.
2015 net interest margin of 2.75% declined eight basis points compared to 2.83% in 2014 as the benefit of lower pay-fixed swap costs was more than offset by increased deposit costs, higher senior and subordinated debt borrowing costs and a modest decrease in loan yields. 2015 average interest-earning asset yields of 3.12% declined two basis points from 3.14% in 2014, reflecting the decline in the commercial loan and lease portfolio yields given the continued impact of the relatively persistent low-rate environment. investment portfolio income of $621 million in 2015 remained relatively stable compared to $619 million in 2014.
total interest-bearing deposit costs of $237 million in 2015 increased $81 million, or 52%, from $156 million in 2014 and reflected a nine basis point increase in the rate paid on deposits to 0.33% from 0.24%. the increase in deposit costs reflected a shift in mix to longer duration deposits, largely term and money market products. the cost of term deposits increased to 0.82% in 2015 from 0.65% in 2014, and money market accounts and savings accounts increased to 0.27% in 2015 from 0.19% in 2014.
total borrowed funds costs of $215 million in 2015 increased modestly from 2014. within the federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowed funds, pay-fixed swap expense declined to $58 million for 2015 compared to $99 million in 2014. including the impact of hedging costs, total borrowed funds rates increased to 1.56% from 1.51% in 2014. the increase in long-term borrowing expense of $50 million was driven by an increase in senior and subordinated debt as we continued to realign our liability and capital structure to better align with peers.

noninterest expense of $3.3 billion in 2015 declined $133 million or 4%, compared to $3.4 billion 2014, driven by a $119 million decrease in restructuring charges and special items. excluding the impact of the restructuring charges and special items, noninterest expense decreased $14 million, driven by lower occupancy expense, salaries and employee benefits and other operating expense, partially offset by higher equipment, amortization of software, and outside services. results reflected the impact of the chicago divestiture and investments to drive future growth, offset by the benefit of efficiency initiatives.
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes of $423 million decreased from $403 million in 2014, respectively and reflected an effective tax rate of 33.5%, which increased from 31.8% in 2014. the increase in the effective income tax rate related to the tax-rate impact of combined reporting legislation, non-deductible permanent expense items, and the adoption of asu no. 2014-01, "accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects." the application of this guidance resulted in the reclassification of the amortization of these investments to income tax expense from noninterest income. furthermore, these increases were partially offset by the tax rate impact of the gain on the chicago divestiture in the second quarter of 2014.
at december 31, 2015, we reported a net deferred tax liability of $730 million, compared to a $493 million liability at december 31, 2014. the increase in the net deferred tax liability was primarily attributable to the increase in the deferred tax liability related to temporary differences of $261 million. for further discussion, see note 15 "income taxes" to our consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included elsewhere in this report.

management's discussion and analysis business segments we operate our business through two operating segments: consumer banking and commercial banking. segment results are derived from our business-line profitability reporting systems by specifically attributing managed assets, liabilities, capital and their related revenues, provision for credit losses and expenses. residual assets, liabilities, capital and their related revenues, provision for credit losses and expenses are attributed to other.
other includes our treasury function, securities portfolio, wholesale funding activities, goodwill and goodwill impairment, community development assets and other unallocated assets, liabilities, capital, revenues, provision for credit losses and expenses not attributed to consumer banking or commercial banking. other also includes our non-core assets. non-core assets are primarily loans inconsistent with our strategic goals, generally as a result of geographic location, industry, product type or risk level. the non-core portfolio totaled $2.3 billion as of december 31, 2015, down 25% from december 31, 2014. the largest component of our non-core portfolio is our home equity products currently or formerly serviced by others portfolio.

our capital levels are evaluated and managed centrally, however, capital is allocated to the operating segments to support evaluation of business performance. operating segments are allocated capital on a risk-adjusted basis considering economic and regulatory capital requirements. we approximate that regulatory capital is equivalent to a sustainable target level for common equity tier 1 and then allocate that approximation to the segments based on economic capital. interest income and expense is determined based on the assets and liabilities managed by the business segment. because funding and asset liability management is a central function, funds transfer-pricing methodologies are utilized to allocate a cost of funds used, or credit for the funds provided, to all business segment assets, liabilities and capital, respectively, using a matched-funding concept. the residual effect on net interest income of asset/liability management, including the residual net interest income related to the funds transfer pricing process, is included in other.

management's discussion and analysis provision for credit losses is allocated to each business segment based on actual net charge-offs that have been recognized by the business segment. the difference between the consolidated provision for credit losses and the business segments' net charge-offs is reflected in other.
noninterest income and expense directly managed by each business segment, including fees, service charges, salaries and benefits, and other direct revenues and costs are accounted for within each segment's financial results in a manner similar to our consolidated financial statements. occupancy costs are allocated based on utilization of facilities by the business segment. noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business segments that directly support another business segment's operations are charged to the applicable business segment based on its utilization of those services.
income taxes are assessed to each business segment at a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in other.
developing and applying methodologies used to allocate items among the business segments is a dynamic process. accordingly, financial results may be revised periodically as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines change, or our organizational structure changes.

commercial banking net income of $579 million increased $18 million, or 3%, from 2014, as an increase in net interest income driven by strong balance sheet growth, deposit cost improvement and reduced impairment costs more than offset lower noninterest income and an increase in noninterest expense.
net interest income of $1.2 billion in 2015 increased $89 million, or 8%, from 2014, reflecting the benefit of an increase of $3.9 billion in average loan balances and $3.6 billion in average deposits, partially offset by spread compression.
noninterest income of $415 million in 2015 decreased $14 million, or 3%, from 2014 as the benefit of an increase in service charges and fees, interest rate products, and card fees was more than offset by lower leasing income, foreign exchange and trade finance fees, and capital markets fee income.
noninterest expense of $709 million in 2015 increased $57 million, or 9%, from $652 million in 2014, reflecting increased salary and benefits costs, outside services, and insurance expense, including continued investments to drive future growth.
provision for credit losses resulted in a net recovery of $13 million in 2015 compared to a net recovery of $6 million in 2014 and reflected continued improvement in credit quality.

other recorded a net loss of $1 million in 2015 compared to net income of $122 million in 2014. the net loss in 2015 included $31 million of after-tax restructuring charges and special items. net income in 2014 included a $180 million after-tax gain related to the chicago divestiture partially offset by $105 million of after-tax restructuring charges and special items. excluding these items, net income decreased by $17 million.
net interest income in 2015 decreased $35 million to $42 million compared to $77 million in 2014. the decrease was driven primarily by an increase in wholesale funding costs, and lower non-core loans, partially offset by a reduction in interest rate swap costs.
noninterest income in 2015 decreased $253 million driven by the $288 million pre-tax gain on the chicago divestiture. excluding the gain, noninterest income increased $35 million driven by an accounting change for low-income housing investments, which is offset in income tax expense.
noninterest expense in 2015 of $94 million decreased $133 million from 2014, reflecting lower restructuring charges and special items of $119 million and lower employee incentive costs.
the provision for credit losses in 2015 decreased $3 million to $63 million compared to $66 million in 2014, reflecting stable credit quality and a decrease in non-core net charge-offs of $23 million to $44 million in 2015 compared to $67 million in 2014. on a quarterly basis, we review and refine our estimate of the allowance for credit losses, taking into consideration changes in portfolio size and composition, historical loss experience, internal risk ratings, current economic conditions, industry-performance trends and other pertinent information. the provision also reflected an increase in overall credit exposure associated with growth in our loan portfolio.
total assets as of december 31, 2015 included $2.1 billion and $4.7 billion of goodwill related to the consumer banking and commercial banking reporting units, respectively. for further information regarding the reconciliation of segment results to gaap results, see note 24 "business segments" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included elsewhere in this report.

management's discussion and analysis results of operations - year ended december 31, 2014 compared with year ended december 31, 2013
highlights for the year ended december 31, 2014:
•   net income of $865 million increased $4.3 billion compared to a loss of $3.4 billion in 2013;
•   net income included a net $180 million after-tax gain related to the chicago divestiture and $105 million after-tax restructuring charges and special noninterest expense items largely related to our separation from rbs and ongoing efforts to improve processes and enhance efficiencies across the organization. 2013 included an after-tax goodwill impairment charge of $4.1 billion. excluding the chicago gain, restructuring charges and special items and the goodwill impairment charge, net income increased $119 million, or 18%, to $790 million(1), from $671 million(1) in 2013;
•   net interest income of $3.3 billion increased $243 million, or 8%, from $3.1 billion in 2013, largely reflecting growth in investment securities and loan portfolios, and a reduction in pay-fixed swap costs and deposit costs as we continued to reduce our reliance on higher cost certificate of deposit and money market deposits. these results were partially offset by the impact of declining loan yields given the relatively persistent low-rate environment and higher long-term borrowing costs;
•   net interest margin of 2.83%, compared to 2.85% in 2013, remained relatively stable as the impact of continued pressure on commercial and retail loan yields and higher long-term borrowing costs were partially offset by a reduction in pay-fixed swap costs and deposit costs;
•   noninterest income of $1.7 billion included a $288 million pre-tax gain on the chicago divestiture, and increased $46 million, or 3%, to $1.7 billion, compared to $1.6 billion in 2013. excluding the gain, noninterest income decreased $242 million, or 15%, driven by the effect of a $116 million reduction in net securities gains, lower mortgage banking fees, and lower service charges and fees, which were partially offset by growth in trust and investment services fees and capital markets fees;
•   noninterest expense of $3.4 billion decreased $4.3 billion, or 56%, compared to $7.7 billion in 2013, which included a pre-tax $4.4 billion goodwill impairment charge. results in 2014 included $169 million in pre-tax restructuring charges and special items compared with $26 million in 2013. excluding the goodwill impairment and restructuring charges and special items, noninterest expense remained relatively stable;
•   provision for credit losses totaled $319 million and decreased $160 million, or 33%, from $479 million in 2013. results in 2014 included a net provision release of $4 million compared with a $22 million release in 2013;
•   our return on average tangible common equity ratio improved to 6.71%(1), from (25.91%)(1) in 2013. excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment, restructuring charges and special items mentioned above, our return on average tangible common equity improved to 6.13%(1) from 5.08%(1) in 2013;
•   average loans and leases of $89.0 billion increased $3.6 billion, or 4%, from $85.4 billion in 2013, due to growth in commercial loans, residential mortgages and auto loans, which more than offset the reduction in home equity loans and lines of credit;
•   average interest-bearing deposits of $64.4 billion decreased $3.5 billion, or 5%, from $67.9 billion in 2013, primarily driven by a $2.0 billion decrease associated with the chicago divestiture as well as a reduction of higher cost money market and term deposits; and
•   net income per average common share, basic and diluted, was $1.55 in 2014, compared to a loss of $6.12 in 2013, which included a goodwill impairment charge of $7.29 per share.

management's discussion and analysis net income (loss)
net income totaled $865 million in 2014, and included $75 million of after-tax net restructuring charges and special items related to our separation from rbs, efforts to improve processes and enhance efficiencies across the organization, and the chicago divestiture. these results increased $4.3 billion from 2013, which included a $4.1 billion after-tax goodwill impairment charge. excluding the gain, restructuring charges and special items and impairment charge noted above, 2014 net income increased $119 million, or 18%, from 2013, as the benefit of lower provision for credit losses and higher net interest income was partially offset by the effect of lower noninterest income and increased noninterest expense.
the special items and restructuring charges in 2014 included a $288 million pre-tax gain ($180 million after tax) on the sale of the chicago-area deposits, $17 million of pre-tax expenses ($11 million after tax) related to the chicago divestiture, $97 million of pre-tax expenses ($61 million after tax), related to our efficiency initiatives, $20 million of pre-tax expenses ($11 million after tax) related to our separation from rbs, and $35 million of other pre-tax expenses ($22 million after tax) related to regulatory initiatives. the restructuring charges in 2013 related to our implementation of a new branch image capture system on the teller line which automated several key processes within the branch network, and our decision to close certain branches, which resulted in lease termination costs and other fixed asset write-offs.
the following table details the significant components of our net income (loss) for the periods indicated:

(1) our sbo portfolio consists of home equity loans and lines that were originally serviced by others. we now service a portion of this portfolio internally.
(2) balances are net of certain short-term receivables associated with reverse repurchase agreements. interest expense includes the full cost of the repurchase agreements and certain hedging costs. the rate on federal funds purchased is elevated due to the impact from pay-fixed interest rate swaps that are scheduled to run off by the end of 2015. see "-analysis of financial condition - december 31, 2015 compared with december 31, 2014 - derivatives" for further information.

citizens financial group, inc.
management's discussion and analysis net interest income of $3.3 billion in 2014 increased $243 million, or 8%, from $3.1 billion in 2013 driven by growth in average interest-earning assets, a reduction in interest rate hedging costs, as well as lower deposit costs. these benefits were partially offset by the effect of declining loan yields and a continued shift in loan mix to lower yielding loans, increased borrowing costs related to our issuance of subordinated debt and the effect of the chicago divestiture. average interest-earning assets of $116.2 billion in 2014 increased $9.0 billion from 2013 driven by a $5.3 billion increase in the investment securities portfolio, a $2.2 billion increase in commercial loans, a $1.6 billion increase in residential mortgages, and a $2.2 billion increase in automobile loans, partially offset by a $2.0 billion decrease in home equity outstandings, a $54 million reduction in student loans, and a $267 million decrease in other retail loans.
2014 net interest margin of 2.83% remained broadly stable compared to 2.85% in 2013 despite continued pressure from the relatively persistent low interest-rate environment. average interest-earning asset yields continued to decline at a pace that exceeded our ability to reduce our cost of interest-bearing deposits. 2014 average interest-earning asset yields of 3.14% declined 11 basis points from 3.25% in 2013, largely reflecting a 13 basis point decline in the loan and lease portfolio yield despite a five basis point improvement in the securities portfolio yield. the decline in loan and lease yields was driven by the effect of a reduction in higher-yielding consumer real estate secured outstandings. in addition, intense industry-wide competition for commercial loans continued to compress spreads on new originations and resulted in additional downward pressure on overall loan yields. investment portfolio income of $619 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased $142 million, or 30%, compared to the year ended december 31, 2013.
total interest-bearing deposit costs of $156 million in 2014 decreased $60 million, or 28%, from $216 million in 2013 and reflected an eight basis point decrease in the rate paid on deposits to 0.24% from 0.32%. the cost of term deposits decreased to 0.65% in 2014 from 0.91% in 2013, while rates on money market and savings declined to 0.19% in 2014 from 0.25% in 2013. due to the historically low interest rate environment, many deposit products have hit pricing floors at or near zero, limiting further rate reduction and thus compressing margins.
the total borrowed funds costs of $203 million in 2014 declined $24 million, or 11%, from $227 million in 2013 driven by the benefit of a $101 million reduction in pay-fixed swap costs which was partially offset by an increase in long-term borrowed funds costs largely related to our issuance of subordinated debt.
total borrowed funds rates declined to 1.51% in 2014 from 6.53% in 2013. within the federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement category and other short-term borrowed funds categories, pay-fixed swap expense declined to $99 million in 2014 from $200 million in 2013. excluding the impact of hedging costs, 2014 borrowed funds costs were 0.78% compared to 1.16% in 2013.

(1) includes net securities impairment losses on securities available for sale recognized in earnings and other income. additionally, noninterest income for the year ended december 31, 2014 reflects a $288 million pre-tax gain related to the chicago divestiture.
noninterest income of $1.7 billion in 2014 increased $46 million, or 3%, from $1.6 billion in 2013, driven by a $288 million pre-tax gain on the chicago divestiture, which was recorded in other income, and a $38 million increase in capital markets fees, partially offset by a $116 million decrease in net securities gains, an $82 million decrease in mortgage banking fees, and a $66 million decrease in service charges and fees. mortgage banking fees reflected overall lower origination volume, the decision to hold more loans on-balance sheet, and were also negatively impacted by a reduction in the recovery of mortgage servicing rights

management's discussion and analysis valuations from the prior year. the decrease in service charges and fees are driven by lower personal overdraft fees resulting from a november 2013 change to our check-posting methodology.
provision for credit losses provision for credit losses of $319 million in 2014 decreased $160 million from $479 million in 2013, driven by a $178 million reduction in net charge-offs. additionally, while overall credit quality continued to improve in 2014, the rate of improvement slowed relative to 2013. as a result, 2014 provision for credit losses included a release of $4 million from the allowance for credit losses (the amount by which net charge-offs exceeded the provision) compared with a release of $22 million in 2013. the provision for loan and lease losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate an appropriate and adequate alll. the total provision for credit losses included the provision for loan and lease losses as well as the provision for unfunded commitments. refer to "-analysis of financial condition - allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets" for more information.

noninterest expense of $3.4 billion in 2014 decreased $4.3 billion from 2013, which included a $4.4 billion pre-tax goodwill impairment charge. our 2014 noninterest expense included $169 million of pre-tax restructuring charges and special items largely related to our separation from rbs as well as ongoing efforts to improve processes and enhance efficiencies across the organization compared with $26 million of restructuring charges and special items in 2013. the 2014 charge included $78 million in outside services, $44 million in salaries and employee benefits, $16 million in occupancy, $6 million in software, $4 million in equipment and $21 million in other operating expense. excluding the restructuring charges and special items and the goodwill impairment, noninterest expense remained relatively stable, as the benefit of our efficiency initiatives helped offset investment in the business to drive future earnings growth as well as higher regulatory costs. see note 22 "exit costs and restructuring reserves" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included elsewhere in this report.
provision (benefit) for income taxes in 2014, we recorded income tax expense of $403 million, compared to an income tax benefit of $42 million in 2013. the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 were 31.8% and 1.2%, respectively. the increase in the effective rate largely reflected the tax rate impact of the goodwill impairment charge taken in 2013. goodwill not deductible for tax purposes accounted for 78.4% of the total goodwill impairment charge and generated a reduction of 35.1% in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2013.
at december 31, 2014, we reported a net deferred tax liability of $493 million, compared to a $199 million liability at december 31, 2013. the increase in the net deferred tax liability was attributable to the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of $76 million (which decreased the deferred tax asset), a decrease in the tax effect on oci of $153 million (which also decreased the deferred tax asset) and an increase in the deferred tax liability related to temporary differences of $65 million. for further discussion, see note 15 "income taxes" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included elsewhere in this report.

(1) loans held for sale refer to mortgage loans held for sale recorded in the consumer banking segment, as well as the loans relating to the chicago divestiture, which were recorded in both the consumer banking and commercial banking segments.
(2) these are non-gaap financial measures. for more information on the computation of these non-gaap financial measures, see "-principal components of operations and key performance metrics used by management - key performance metrics and non-gaap financial measures."
(3) operating segments are allocated capital on a risk-adjusted basis considering economic and regulatory capital requirements. we approximate that regulatory capital is equivalent to a sustainable target level for cet1 and then allocate that approximation to the segments based on economic capital.
(4) includes the financial impact of non-core, liquidating loan portfolios and other non-core assets, our treasury activities, wholesale funding activities, securities portfolio, community development assets and other unallocated assets, liabilities, revenues, provision for credit losses and expenses not attributed to our consumer banking or commercial banking segments. for a description of non-core assets, see "-analysis of financial condition - december 31, 2015 compared with december 31, 2014 - loans and leases-non-core assets."
we operate our business through two operating segments: consumer banking and commercial banking. segment results are derived from our business line profitability reporting systems by specifically attributing managed assets, liabilities, capital and their related revenues, provision for credit losses and expenses. residual assets, liabilities, capital and their related revenues, provision for credit losses and expenses are attributed to other.
other includes our treasury function, securities portfolio, wholesale funding activities, goodwill and goodwill impairment, community development assets and other unallocated assets, liabilities, capital, revenues, provision for credit losses and expenses not attributed to consumer banking or commercial banking. other also includes our non-core assets. non-core assets are primarily loans inconsistent with our strategic goals, generally as a result of geographic location, industry, product type or risk level. the non-core portfolio totaled $3.1 billion as of december 31, 2014, down 19% from december 31, 2013. the largest component of our non-core portfolio is our home equity products currently or formerly serviced by others portfolio.
our capital levels are evaluated and managed centrally; however, capital is allocated to the operating segments to support evaluation of business performance. operating segments are allocated capital on a risk-adjusted basis considering economic and regulatory capital requirements. we approximate that regulatory capital is equivalent to a sustainable target level for common equity tier 1 and then allocate that approximation to the segments based on economic capital. interest income and expense is determined based on the assets and liabilities managed by the business segment. because funding and asset liability management is a central function, funds transfer-pricing methodologies are utilized to allocate a cost of funds used, or credit for the funds provided, to all business segment assets, liabilities and capital, respectively, using a matched funding concept. the residual effect on net interest income of asset/liability management, including the residual net interest income related to the funds transfer pricing process, is included in other.

management's discussion and analysis provision for credit losses is allocated to each business segment based on actual net charge-offs that have been recognized by the business segment. the difference between the consolidated provision for credit losses and the business segments' net charge-offs is reflected in other.
noninterest income and expense directly managed by each business segment, including fees, service charges, salaries and benefits, and other direct revenues and costs are accounted for within each segment's financial results in a manner similar to our audited consolidated financial statements. occupancy costs are allocated based on utilization of facilities by the business segment. generally, operating losses are charged to the business segment when the loss event is realized in a manner similar to a loan charge-off. noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business segments that directly support another business segment's operations are charged to the applicable business segment based on its utilization of those services.
income taxes are assessed to each business segment at a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in other.
developing and applying methodologies used to allocate items among the business segments is a dynamic process. accordingly, financial results may be revised periodically as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines change, or our organizational structure changes.

consumer banking segment net income of $182 million in 2014 decreased $60 million, or 25%, from $242 million in 2013, as the benefit of a reduction in provision for credit losses was more than offset by lower revenue, driven by overall mortgage banking headwinds, and lower service charges and fee income.
total revenue was $3.1 billion in 2014, down $151 million, or 5%, from $3.2 billion in 2013. net interest income of $2.2 billion in 2014 remained broadly stable with the prior year, as the benefit of lower deposit costs and loan growth was more than offset by the effect of the relatively persistent low-rate environment and the chicago divestiture. loan growth reflected higher residential mortgage and auto loan outstandings, partially offset by lower home equity outstandings. noninterest income of $899 million decreased $126 million, or 12%, from $1.0 billion in 2013, driven by lower mortgage banking fees, service charges and fees, and the impact of the chicago divestiture, partially offset by growth in trust and investment services fees and a gain on sale of discontinued student loan portfolio.

management's discussion and analysis mortgage banking fees of $71 million in 2014 decreased $82 million, driven by overall lower origination volume and the decision to hold more loans on-balance sheet. mortgage banking fees were also negatively impacted by a reduction in the recovery of mortgage servicing rights valuations from the prior year. service charges and fees of $416 million decreased $58 million, or 12%, from 2013, driven by the impact of a change in check-posting order as well as the chicago divestiture. results also reflected the benefit of growth in trust and investment services fees as well as a $9 million gain on sale of student loans.
noninterest expense of $2.5 billion in 2014 remained relatively stable with the prior year as the benefit of our efficiency initiatives and the impact of the chicago divestiture were offset by continued investment in the business to drive future growth.
provision for credit losses of $259 million in 2014 decreased $49 million, or 16%, from $308 million in 2013, reflecting improved credit quality.

commercial banking net income of $561 million in 2014 increased $47 million, or 9%, from $514 million in 2013, driven by an $82 million increase in total revenue, partially offset by higher expenses and slightly lower credit net recoveries.
net interest income of $1.1 billion in 2014 increased $42 million, or 4%, from $1.0 billion in 2013, largely due to a $3.0 billion increase in interest-earning assets and a $2.3 billion increase in customer deposits which was partially offset by continued downward pressure on loan yields given the relatively persistent low-rate environment and increased industry-wide competition.
noninterest income of $429 million in 2014 increased $40 million, or 10%, from $389 million in 2013, as a $51 million increase in leasing income and capital markets fees was partially offset by lower interest rate product, foreign exchange and trade finance fees.
noninterest expense of $652 million in 2014 increased $17 million from $635 million in 2013.
provision for credit losses in 2014 reflected a net recovery on prior period charge-offs of $6 million compared with a net recovery of $7 million in 2013.

other recorded net income of $122 million in 2014 compared with a net loss of $4.2 billion in 2013, which included an after-tax goodwill impairment charge of $4.1 billion. excluding the goodwill impairment, the net loss in 2013 was $102 million. net income in 2014 included a $180 million after-tax gain related to the chicago divestiture, partially offset by $105 million of after-tax restructuring charges and special items. net loss in 2013 also included $17 million of after-tax restructuring charges and special items. excluding these items, net income increased $132 million driven by higher net interest income as well as lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower noninterest income.
net interest income in 2014 increased $226 million to $77 million compared to an expense of $149 million in 2013. the increase was driven by the benefit of a $5.1 billion increase in average investment securities, a reduction in interest rate swap costs, and an increase in residual net interest income related to funds transfer pricing, partially offset by higher wholesale funding costs, and a $1.3 billion decrease in average non-core loan balances.
noninterest income in 2014 increased $132 million driven by the $288 million pre-tax gain on the chicago divestiture. excluding the gain, noninterest income decreased $156 million driven by a $116 million reduction in securities gains and higher net losses on low-income housing investments, which are more than offset by increased tax credits.
noninterest expense in 2014 of $227 million included $169 million of pre-tax restructuring charges and special items and decreased $4.3 billion from 2013, which included the $4.4 billion pre-tax goodwill impairment charge, and $26 million of pre-tax restructuring charges and special items. excluding the goodwill impairment, restructuring charges and special items, noninterest expense decreased $3 million largely reflecting lower costs related to the non-core loan portfolio, largely offset by higher employee incentive costs. for further information about these special items, including expected additional future costs, see note 22 "exit costs and restructuring reserves" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included elsewhere in this report.
the provision for credit losses within other mainly represents the residual change in the consolidated allowance for credit losses after attributing the respective net charge-offs to the consumer banking and commercial banking segments. it also includes net charge-offs related to the non-core portfolio. the provision for credit losses in 2014 decreased $112 million to $66 million compared to $178 million in 2013, reflecting continued improvement in credit quality and decreased non-core net charge-offs of $128 million. on a quarterly basis, we review and refine our estimate of the allowance for credit losses, taking into consideration changes in portfolio size and composition, historical loss experience, internal risk ratings, current economic conditions, industry performance trends and other pertinent information. in 2014, changes in these factors led to a net release of $4 million in the allowance for credit losses compared with a net release of $22 million in 2013. the provision also reflected an increase in overall credit exposure associated with growth in our loan portfolio.
total assets as of december 31, 2014 included $2.1 billion and $4.7 billion of goodwill related to the consumer banking and commercial banking reporting units, respectively. for further information regarding the reconciliation of segment results to gaap results, see note 24 "business segments" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included elsewhere in this report.

total loans and leases of $99.0 billion as of december 31, 2015, increased $5.6 billion, or 6%, from $93.4 billion as of december 31, 2014, reflecting growth in retail and commercial. total commercial loans and leases of $46.2 billion grew $3.0 billion, or 7%, from $43.2 billion as of december 31, 2014, reflecting commercial loan growth of $1.8 billion and growth in commercial real estate of $1.2 billion. total retail loans of $52.8 billion increased $2.6 billion, or 5%, from $50.2 billion as of december 31, 2014, as a $2.1 billion increase in student, a $1.5 billion increase in residential mortgages, and a $1.1 billion increase in auto, were partially offset by lower home equity balances, including continued run off in the non-core portfolio.
the effect of loan purchases and sales in 2015, net of run off of previously purchased loans, increased year-end loans by $1.2 billion. see note 4 "loans and leases" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included elsewhere in this report, for further information.

(1) our sbo portfolio consists of purchased home equity loans and lines that were originally serviced by others. we now service a portion of this portfolio internally.
non-core assets are primarily loans inconsistent with our strategic goals, generally as a result of geographic location, industry, product type or risk level. non-core assets totaled $2.3 billion as of december 31, 2015. we have actively managed these loans down since they were designated as non-core on june 30, 2009. between that time and december 31, 2015, the portfolio decreased $18.1 billion, including principal repayments of $10.1 billion; charge-offs of $3.9 billion; transfers back to the core portfolio of $2.8 billion; and sales of $1.3 billion. transfers from non-core back to core were handled on an individual-request basis and managed through our chief credit officer.
non-core assets totaled $2.3 billion as of december 31, 2015, down 25% from december 31, 2014, driven by principal repayments of $696 million. commercial non-core loan balances declined 41% compared to december 31, 2014, ending at $168 million compared to $284 million at december 31, 2014. retail non-core loan balances of $2.1 billion decreased $607 million, or 22%, compared to december 31, 2014.
the largest component of our non-core portfolio is the home equity sbo portfolio. the sbo portfolio is a liquidating portfolio consisting of pools of home equity loans and lines of credit purchased between 2003 and 2007. although our sbo portfolio consists of loans that were initially serviced by others, we now service a portion of this portfolio internally. sbo balances serviced externally totaled $763 million and $1.1 billion as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the sbo portfolio has been closed to new purchases since the third quarter of 2007, with exposure down to $1.4 billion as of december 31, 2015, compared to $1.8 billion as of december 31, 2014. the sbo portfolio represented 4% of the retail real estate secured portfolio and 3% of the overall retail loan portfolio as of december 31, 2015.
the credit profile of the sbo portfolio was weaker than the core real estate portfolio, with a weighted-average refreshed fico score of 712 and cltv of 90% as of december 31, 2015. the proportion of the portfolio in a second lien (subordinated) position was 96% with 72% of the portfolio in out-of-footprint geographies including 28% in california, nevada, arizona and florida.
sbo credit performance continued to improve in 2015 driven by continued portfolio liquidation (the weakest performing loans have already been charged off), more effective account servicing and collection strategies, and improvements in the real estate market. sbo portfolio year-to-date net charge-offs of $20.2 million, or 1.3% annualized, as of december 31, 2015 improved 82 basis points from 2.1% for the full year 2014.

management's discussion and analysis allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets we and our banking subsidiaries, cbna and cbpa, maintain an allowance for credit losses, consisting of an alll and a reserve for unfunded lending commitments. this allowance is created through charges to income, or provision for credit losses, and is maintained at an appropriate level adequate to absorb anticipated losses and is determined in accordance with gaap. for further information on our processes to determine our allowance for credit losses, see "-critical accounting estimates - allowance for credit losses," note 1 "significant accounting policies" and note 5 "allowance for credit losses, nonperforming assets, and concentrations of credit risk" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included elsewhere in this report.
the allowance for credit losses totaled $1.3 billion at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. our alll was 1.23% of total loans and leases and 115% of nonperforming loans and leases as of december 31, 2015 compared with 1.28% and 109% as of december 31, 2014.
overall, loan portfolio credit quality continued to improve across many measures in the year ended december 31, 2015; however, as expected, the rate of improvement began to level off in the second half of 2015 as credit trends continued to normalize from lower levels. as such, we expect asset quality trends to continue to normalize in the future. net charge-offs for the year ended december 31, 2015 of $284 million decreased 12% compared to $323 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the portfolio annualized net charge-off rate declined to 0.30% for the year ended december 31, 2015 from 0.36% for the year ended december 31, 2014. the 90 day or more past due delinquency rate was 0.9% as of december 31, 2015 and 2014. nonperforming loans and leases totaled $1.1 billion, or 1.07%, of the total portfolio as of december 31, 2015 and $1.1 billion, or 1.18% in december 31, 2014. at december 31, 2015, $742 million of nonperforming loans and leases had been designated as impaired and had no specific alll because they had been written down to the fair value of their collateral. these impaired loans included $672 million of retail loans and $70 million of commercial loans.
commercial loan asset quality our commercial loan and lease portfolio consists of traditional commercial loans, commercial real estate loans and leases. the portfolio is predominantly focused on customers in our footprint where our local delivery model provides for strong client connectivity. however, we also do business in certain specialized industry sectors on a national basis.
for commercial loans and leases, we use regulatory classification ratings to monitor credit quality. loans with a "pass" rating are those that we believe will be fully repaid in accordance with the contractual loan terms. commercial loans and leases that are "criticized" are those that have some weakness that indicates an increased probability of future loss. see note 5 "allowance for credit losses, nonperforming assets, and concentrations of credit risk" to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included elsewhere in this report.
as of december 31, 2015, nonperforming commercial loans and leases decreased $16 million, or 10%, to $148 million, compared to $164 million as of december 31, 2014, driven by a 38% decline in commercial nonperforming loans. as of december 31, 2015, total commercial nonperforming loans stood at 0.3% of the commercial loan portfolio, compared to 0.4% as of december 31, 2014. net charge-offs in our total commercial loan and lease portfolio for the year ended december 31, 2015 reflected a net recovery of $13 million compared to a net recovery of $15 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. see "-key factors affecting our business - credit trends" for further details.
notwithstanding the improvement in nonperforming loans and leases, during the year ended december 31, 2015, total criticized loans and leases in the total commercial loan and lease portfolio, including commercial real estate loans, increased to $2.6 billion, or 5.6% of the portfolio compared to $1.9 billion, or 4.5%, at december 31, 2014. commercial loan criticized balances increased to $2.0 billion, or 6.0%, of the commercial loan portfolio compared to $1.4 billion, or 4.5%, as of december 31, 2014, driven by a $331 million increase in the oil and gas industry portfolio, with most of the commercial loan criticized balance increase occurring in fourth quarter 2015. commercial real estate criticized balances increased to $521 million, or 5.8%, of the commercial real estate portfolio compared to $455 million, or 5.8%, as of december 31, 2014. commercial loans accounted for 76% of criticized loans as of december 31, 2015, compared to 73% as of december 31, 2014. commercial real estate accounted for 20% of criticized loans as of december 31, 2015, compared to 24% as of december 31, 2014.
retail loan asset quality for retail loans, we primarily use the loan's payment and delinquency status to monitor credit quality. the longer a loan is past due, the greater the likelihood of future credit loss. these credit quality indicators are continually updated and monitored. our retail loan portfolio remains focused on lending across the new england, mid-atlantic and midwest regions, with continued geographic expansion outside the footprint primarily in the auto finance and student lending portfolios. retail assets increased to $52.8 billion as of december 31, 2015, a 5% increase from december 31, 2014, driven by growth in the student lending, residential mortgage and auto finance portfolio, offset by a reduction in home equity balances, including run off in the non-core portfolio.

management's discussion and analysis the credit composition of our retail loan portfolio at december 31, 2015 remained favorable and well-positioned across all product lines with an average refreshed fico score of 757, an improvement of 2 points from december 31, 2014. our real estate cltv ratio is calculated as the mortgage and second lien loan balance divided by the appraised value of the property and was 63.6% as of december 31, 2015 compared to 65.4% as of december 31, 2014. excluding the sbo portfolio, the real estate cltv was 62.3% as of december 31, 2015 compared to 63.8% as of december 31, 2014. asset quality is improving with a net charge-off rate (core and non-core) of 0.58% for the year ended december 31, 2015, a decrease of 12 basis points from the year ended december 31, 2014.
nonperforming retail loans as a percentage of total retail loans were 1.7% as of december 31, 2015, a 14 basis point decrease from december 31, 2014. retail nonaccrual loans of $904 million at december 31, 2015 decreased $26 million from $930 million at december 31, 2014, reflecting lower mortgage and home equity portfolios, partially offset by increases in the student lending and auto finance portfolios.

troubled debt restructuring tdr is the classification given to a loan that has been restructured in a manner that grants a concession, that we would not otherwise make, to a borrower that is experiencing financial hardship. tdrs typically result from our loss mitigation efforts and are undertaken in order to improve the likelihood of recovery and continuity of the relationship. our loan modifications are handled on a case by case basis and are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan collectability and meet our borrower's financial needs. the types of concessions include interest rate reductions, term extensions, principal forgiveness and other modifications to the structure of the loan that fall outside our lending policy. depending on the specific facts and circumstances of the customer, restructuring can involve loans moving to nonaccrual, remaining on nonaccrual or continuing on accrual status. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, we classified $1.2 billion as retail tdrs. in the retail tdr population, $379 million were in nonaccrual status of which 51% were current in payment. tdrs generally return to accrual status once repayment capacity and appropriate payment history can be established. tdrs are evaluated for impairment individually. loans are classified as tdrs until paid off, sold or refinanced at market terms.
for additional information regarding tdrs, see "-critical accounting estimates - allowance for credit losses," and note 1 "significant accounting policies" and note 5 "allowance for credit losses, nonperforming assets, and concentrations of credit risk" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included elsewhere in this report.

as of december 31, 2015, the fair value of the afs and htm securities portfolio decreased by $668 million, or 3%, to $23.2 billion, compared to $23.8 billion as of december 31, 2014, reflecting sales of mortgage-backed securities and a corresponding  reduction in collateralized borrowings, partially offset by continued reinvestment of securities cashflows and an increase in the market value of the securities portfolio due to a decline in interest rates as of december 31, 2015. as of december 31, 2015, the portfolio's average effective duration was 3.5 years compared with 4.2 years as of december 31, 2014.
the securities portfolio included high quality, highly liquid investments reflecting our ongoing commitment to maintaining appropriate contingent liquidity and pledging capacity. u.s. government-guaranteed notes and government-sponsored entity-issued mortgage-backed securities represented the vast majority of the securities portfolio holdings. the portfolio composition has also

management's discussion and analysis been dominated by holdings backed by mortgages so that they may be pledged to the fhlbs. this has become increasingly important due to the enhanced liquidity requirements of the liquidity coverage ratio. for further discussion of the liquidity coverage ratios, see "regulation and supervision - liquidity standards" in part i, item 1 - business, included elsewhere in this report.
income on debt securities portfolios totaled $579 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, a decrease of $4 million, or 1%, from $583 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, and reflected a yield of 2.44% compared with 2.49% for the year ended december 31, 2014.

short-term borrowed funds of $3.4 billion as of december 31, 2015, decreased $7.1 billion from december 31, 2014, as we reduced our reliance on short-term borrowings, including short-term fhlb borrowings, repurchase agreements, and federal funds purchased.
as of december 31, 2015, our total contingent liquidity was $23.1 billion, consisting of $2.0 billion in net cash at the frb (which is defined as excess cash balances held at the frbs), $17.0 billion in unencumbered high-quality securities, and $4.1 billion in unused fhlb borrowing capacity. additionally, $11.0 billion in unencumbered loans pledged at the frbs created total available liquidity of approximately $34.1 billion.

management's discussion and analysis on december 3, 2015, we repurchased $750 million of outstanding subordinated debt instruments held by rbs. the $3 million difference between the repurchase price and the net carrying amount of the subordinated debt was recognized as a gain on extinguishment of the debt. to fund the repurchase, we issued $750 million of new subordinated debt with a 4.300% fixed rate and a ten year maturity.
long-term borrowed funds of $9.9 billion as of december 31, 2015 increased $5.2 billion from december 31, 2014, primarily driven by a $4.2 billion increase in long term fhlb advances, a $750 million increase in senior bank debt, and a $250 million increase in subordinated debt used to fund the august 3, 2015 repurchase of 9,615,384 shares of our common stock.
access to additional funding through repurchase agreements, collateralized borrowed funds or asset sales is available. additionally, there is capacity to grow deposits or issue senior or subordinated notes.
derivatives we use pay-fixed swaps to lengthen liabilities synthetically and offset duration in fixed-rate assets. we also use pay-fixed swaps to hedge floating rate wholesale funding. notional balances totaled $5.0 billion as of december 31, 2015, compared with $1.0 billion as of december 31, 2014, as we added $4.0 billion of new forward-starting swaps in 2015 to rebalance our interest profile. pay-fixed rates on the swaps ranged from 1.96% to 4.30% as of december 31, 2015, compared to 4.18% to 4.30% as of december 31, 2014. we received the daily federal funds effective rate on the legacy $1.0 billion notional. the hedges that were added in 2015 are forward starting and begin accruing interest in 2017, at which point we will receive one-month libor and pay an average fixed rate of 2.06%.
we use receive-fixed swaps to minimize the exposure to variability in the interest cash flows on our floating rate assets. at december 31, 2015 and 2014, the notional amount of receive-fixed swap hedges of floating-rate loans totaled $8.5 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, and the fixed-rate ranges were 0.77% to 2.04% and 1.78% to 2.04%, respectively. we paid one-month libor on these swaps.
in december 2015, we entered into:
•   a forward starting $500 million pay-fixed interest-rate swap agreement to manage the interest rate exposure on forecasted issuance of senior fixed-rate debt to be issued in july 2016. we pay a fixed rate of 1.82% on the swap agreement and receive three-month libor;
•   a $166 million receive-fixed interest-rate swap agreement to manage the interest rate exposure on fixed-rate sub-debt issued in october 2014. this agreement converted the 4.02% fixed-rate debt coupon to three-month libor. we receive a fixed rate of 2.02% on the swap agreement and pay three-month libor; and,
•   a $334 million receive-fixed interest-rate swap agreement to manage the interest rate exposure on fixed-rate sub-debt issued in october 2014. this agreement converted the 4.08% fixed-rate debt coupon to three-month libor. we receive a fixed rate of 2.05% on the swap agreement and pay three-month libor.
in november 2015, we entered into a $750 million receive-fixed interest-rate swap agreement to manage the interest rate exposure on our three-year medium term fixed-rate debt issued in november 2015. this agreement converted the 2.30% fixed-rate debt coupon to three-month libor. we receive a fixed rate of 1.24% on the swap agreement and pay three-month libor.
in may 2015, we entered into a $750 million receive-fixed interest-rate swap agreement to manage the interest rate exposure on our three-year medium term fixed-rate debt issued in december 2014. this agreement converted the 1.60% fixed-rate debt coupon to three-month libor plus 49 basis points. we receive a fixed rate of 1.11% on the swap agreement and pay three-month libor.
in december 2014, we entered into a $750 million receive-fixed interest-rate swap agreement to manage the interest rate exposure on our five-year medium term fixed-rate debt issued in december 2014. this agreement converted the 2.45% fixed-rate debt coupon to three-month libor plus 79 basis points. we receive a fixed rate of 1.66% on the swap agreement and pay three-month libor.
we also sell interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forwards to commercial customers. offsetting swap and forward agreements are simultaneously transacted to minimize our market risk associated with the customer derivative contracts. the assets and liabilities recorded for derivatives not designated as hedges reflect the market value of these transactions.

(1) the notional or contractual amount of interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts is the amount upon which interest and other payments under the contract are based. for interest rate derivatives, the notional amount is typically not exchanged. therefore, notional amounts should not be taken as the measure of credit or market risk as they tend to greatly overstate the true economic risk of these contracts.
(2) amounts represent the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to settle positive and negative positions.
(3) we also offset assets and liabilities associated with repurchase agreements on our consolidated balance sheets. see note 3, "securities," in our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included elsewhere in this report.
at december 31, 2015, the overall derivative asset value decreased $4 million and the liability balance decreased by $127 million from december 31, 2014, primarily due to decreased fixed interest rates at december 31, 2015, compared to december 31, 2014 and increased notional balances for the same period.

in july 2013, the frb, occ and fdic issued the u.s. basel iii final rules. the rules implement the basel committee on banking supervision's basel iii capital framework and certain provisions of the dodd-frank act, including the collins amendment. the u.s. basel iii final rules substantially revised the risk-based capital and leverage requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their insured depository institution subsidiaries, including cbna and cbpa. the u.s. basel iii final rules became effective for cfg and its depository institution subsidiaries, including cbna and cbpa, on january 1, 2015 (subject to a phase-in period for certain provisions).
the u.s. basel iii final rules, among other things, (i) introduced a new capital measure called cet1, (ii) specified that tier 1 capital consists of cet1 and "additional tier 1 capital" instruments meeting certain revised requirements, (iii) defined cet1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to cet1 and not to the other components of capital, and (iv) expanded the scope of the deductions/ adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations. under the u.s. basel iii final rules, the minimum capital ratios effective as of january 1, 2015 are:
•   4.5% cet1 to risk-weighted assets;
•   6.0% tier 1 capital (cet1 plus additional tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets;
•   8.0% total capital (tier 1 capital plus tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and
•   4.0% tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the "leverage ratio").
the u.s. basel iii final rules also introduced a new "capital conservation buffer", composed entirely of cet1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. the implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on january 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and will increase by 0.625% on each subsequent january 1, until it reaches 2.5% on january 1, 2019. banking institutions with a ratio of cet1 to risk-weighted assets below the effective minimum (4.5% plus the capital conservation buffer and, if applicable, the countercyclical capital buffer) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.
when fully phased in on january 1, 2019, the u.s. basel iii final rules will require cfg, cbna and cbpa to maintain an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of cet1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) cet1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, (iii) a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%, and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%.
the u.s. basel iii final rules also provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to cet1. these include, for example, the requirement that certain deferred tax assets and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from cet1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of cet1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of cet1. implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to cet1 began on january 1, 2015 and will be phased-in over a 4-year period (beginning at 40% on january 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter).
the u.s. basel iii final rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expanded the risk-weighting categories from the general risk-based capital rules to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for u.s. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories.
with respect to cbna and cbpa, the u.s. basel iii final rules also revise the "prompt corrective action" regulations pursuant to section 38 of the federal deposit insurance act, as discussed above in "federal deposit insurance act."

standardized approach the basel iii standardized approach measures risk-weighted assets primarily for market risk and credit risk exposures. exposures subject to market risk are measured on a basis generally consistent with how market risk-weighted assets were measured using the market risk rules as defined under the basel 2.5. refer to "-market risk - market risk regulatory capital," for further information. cfg applies the basel iii standardized approach, as defined by the u.s. regulators, for determining the assignment of risk-weighted assets. under the standardized approach, which is the risk-weight methodology applicable to cfg, no distinction is made for variations in credit quality for corporate exposures. additionally, the economic benefit of collateral is restricted to a limited list of eligible securities and cash. we estimate our common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the basel iii standardized approach, on a fully phased-in basis, to be 11.7% at december 31, 2015. as of december 31, 2015, we estimated that our basel iii standardized common equity tier 1 capital would be $13.4 billion and total risk-weighted assets would be $114.3 billion, on a fully-phased in basis. our estimates under the basel iii standardized approach may be refined over time because of further rulemaking or clarification by u.s. banking regulators or as our understanding and interpretation of the rules evolve. actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.

management's discussion and analysis cet1 capital under basel iii standardized transitional rules was $13.4 billion at december 31, 2015, an increase of $216 million from tier 1 common equity under basel i at december 31, 2014. the increase was primarily attributable to net income for year ended december 31, 2015, net of dividends paid to stockholders, $500 million in aggregate repurchases of common shares executed on april 7, 2015 and august 3, 2015, and amortization of deferred tax related to goodwill. at december 31, 2015, there was approximately $247 million of additional tier 1 capital, reflecting the capital value after issuance costs of the 5.500% fixed-to-floating non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series a, issued on april 6, 2015. tier 1 capital at december 31, 2015 was $13.6 billion, an increase of $463 million over the year, as approximately half of the repurchase of common shares was offset by the issuance of preferred shares. total capital was $17.5 billion at december 31, 2015, an increase of $724 million from december 31, 2014 driven primarily by net income, net of dividends paid to stockholders, as the combined impact of the repurchase of common shares, issuance of preferred shares and issuance of $250 million in subordinated debt on july 31, 2015 was generally neutral to total capital.
on january 1, 2015, we began reporting risk-weighted assets based on basel iii standardized transitional rules. the conversion from basel i rules resulted in a $2.7 billion increase in rwas as of december 31, 2014. this increase was primarily driven by risk weight changes for securitization, off-balance sheet commitments with original maturity one year or less, past due and nonaccruals and the removal of the cap on otc derivatives.
risk-weighted assets based on basel iii standardized transitional rules at december 31, 2015 were $114.1 billion, an increase of $8.1 billion as compared to december 31, 2014. the primary drivers for this change were the adoption of the basel iii standardized approach, as well as growth in commercial, consumer auto and student loan exposures.
as of december 31, 2015, the tier 1 leverage ratio decreased approximately 13 basis points. this decline reflected the net impact of a $5.9 billion increase in adjusted quarterly average total assets, which drove a 49 basis point decline in the ratio, and the previously noted increase in tier 1 capital, which added 36 basis points to the ratio.

capital adequacy process our assessment of capital adequacy begins with our risk appetite and risk management framework. this framework provides for the identification, measurement and management of material risks. capital requirements are determined for actual
86
citizens financial group, inc.
management's discussion and analysis and forecasted risk portfolios using applicable regulatory capital methodologies. the assessment also considers the possible impacts of approved and proposed regulatory changes that will or may apply to future periods. key analytical frameworks, which enable the comprehensive assessment of capital adequacy versus unexpected loss, supplement our base case forecast. these supplemental frameworks include integrated stress testing, as well as an internal capital adequacy requirement that builds on internally assessed economic capital requirements. a robust governance framework supports our capital planning process. this process includes capital management policies and procedures that document capital adequacy metrics and limits, as well as our comprehensive capital contingency plan and the active engagement of both the legal-entity boards and senior management in oversight and decision-making.
forward-looking assessments of capital adequacy for us and for our banking subsidiaries feed development of capital plans that are submitted to the frbg and other bank regulators. we prepare these plans in full compliance with the frbg's capital plan rule and we participate annually in the frbg's extensive ccar review process. in addition to the stress test requirements under ccar, we also participate in semiannual stress tests required by the dodd-frank act.
in march 2015, the frbg assessed our current capital plan in response to the ccar process and issued a notice of non-objection. unless we choose to file an amended capital plan prior to april 2016, the maximum levels at which we may declare dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock through june 30, 2016 are governed by the proposed capital actions and, are subject to actual financial performance, as well as ongoing compliance with internal governance and all other regulatory requirements.
capital transactions during the year ended december 31, 2015, we completed the following capital actions:
•   declared and paid common dividends of $0.10 per share, aggregating to dividend payments of approximately $55 million, $53 million, $53 million and $53 million, respectively, in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2015;
•   issued 250,000 shares of the 5.500% fixed-to-floating non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series a, on april 6, 2015, with aggregate liquidation value of $250 million and approximately $247 million of net capital value after deduction of fixed issuance costs;
•   repurchased 10,473,397 of our outstanding common shares from rbs, on april 7, 2015, at a price of $23.87 per share reducing market and regulatory capital by approximately $250 million;
•   issued $250 million aggregate principal amount 4.350% subordinated notes due 2025 on july 31, 2015;
•   repurchased 9,615,384 of our outstanding common shares from rbs on august 3, 2015, at a price of $26.00 per share reducing market and regulatory capital by approximately $250 million;
•   declared a semi-annual dividend of $27.50 per share on the 5.500% fixed-to-floating rate non-cumulative perpetual series a preferred stock, aggregating to approximately $7 million, and paid on october 6, 2015;
•   issued $750 million aggregate principal amount 4.300% subordinated notes due 2025 on december 3, 2015;
•   repurchased $333 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.771% subordinated notes due 2023 from rbs, on december 3, 2015;
•   repurchased $334 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.691% subordinated notes due 2024 from rbs, on december 3, 2015; and
•   repurchased $83 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.153% subordinated notes due 2024 from rbs, on december 3, 2015.
the direct repurchase of subordinated debt from rbs and the public issuance of subordinated debt during the fourth quarter of 2015 were generally neutral to our total capital level and ratios. the repurchase of common shares and the issuance of subordinated debt during the third quarter of 2015 were neutral to our total capital level and ratios but reduced common equity by $250 million, and the cet1 and tier 1 risk-based ratios by 22 basis points. the repurchase of common shares and the issuance of preferred shares during the second quarter of 2015 were generally neutral to our tier 1 and total capital levels and ratios but reduced common equity by $250 million and the cet1 ratio by approximately 23 basis points.
we intend to continue to repurchase common stock and subordinated debt, as appropriate, subject to regulatory approval and market conditions.
at december 31, 2015, all regulatory ratios remained well above their respective fully phased-in basel iii minimum, which includes the capital conservation buffer for the risk-based ratios. fully phased-in regulatory ratios are non-gaap financial measures. for more information on computation of these non-gaap financial measures, see "-principal components of

(1) basel iii introduced the concept of cet i effective january 1, 2015. "common equity tier 1 capital ratio" as of december 31, 2015 represents cet1 divided by total risk-weighted assets as defined under basel iii standardized approach.
(2) "tier 1 capital ratio" is tier 1 capital, which includes cet1 capital plus non-cumulative perpetual preferred equity that qualifies as additional tier 1 capital, divided by total risk-weighted assets as defined under basel iii standardized approach. the "tier 1 capital ratio" reported prior to january 1, 2015, represented tier 1 capital divided by total risk-weighted assets as defined under the basel i general risk-based capital rule.
(3) "total capital ratio" is total capital divided by total risk-weighted assets as defined under basel iii standardized approach. the "total capital ratio" reported prior to january 1, 2015, represented total capital divided by total risk-weighted assets as defined under the basel i general risk-based capital rule.
(4) "tier 1 leverage ratio" is tier 1 capital divided by quarterly average total assets as defined under basel iii standardized approach. the "tier 1 leverage ratio" reported prior to january 1, 2015, represented tier 1 capital divided by quarterly average total assets as defined under the basel i general risk-based capital rule.
cbna cet1 capital under basel iii standardized transitional rules was $10.8 billion at december 31, 2015, an increase of $348 million from tier 1 common equity under basel i at december 31, 2014. the increase was primarily attributable to net income for the year ended december 31, 2015, net of dividends paid to cfg. at december 31, 2015, cbna held minimal additional tier 1 capital. total capital was $13.1 billion at december 31, 2015, an increase of $548 million driven primarily by the increase in cet1 capital.
on january 1, 2015, cbna began reporting risk-weighted assets based on basel iii standardized transitional rules. the conversion from basel i rules resulted in a $2.0 billion increase in rwas as of december 31, 2014. this increase was primarily driven by risk weight changes for securitizations, commercial past due and nonaccruals, off-balance sheet commitments with an original maturity one year or less and the removal of the cap on otc derivatives.
cbna risk-weighted assets based on basel iii standardized transitional rules at december 31, 2015 were $91.6 billion, an increase of $6.3 billion as compared to december 31, 2014. the primary drivers for this change were the adoption of the basel iii standardized approach, as well as growth in commercial, student and consumer auto loan exposures. these increases were partially offset by run off in home lending exposures.
as of december 31, 2015, the cbna tier 1 leverage ratio decreased approximately 18 basis points, driven by an increase in adjusted quarterly average total assets of $4.9 billion resulting in a 54 basis point decline in the ratio, partially offset by a 36 basis point increase for higher cet1 capital described above.
cbpa cet1 capital under basel iii standardized transitional rules was $3.0 billion at december 31, 2015, an increase of $50 million from tier 1 common equity under basel i at december 31, 2014. the increase was primarily attributable to amortization of deferred tax related to goodwill, as net income for the year ended december 31, 2015, net of dividends paid to cfg, was flat compared to 2014. at december 31, 2015, there was no additional tier 1 capital. total capital was $3.6 billion at december 31, 2015, an increase of $65 million driven primarily by the increase in cet1 capital and a slight increase in allowance for credit losses.

management's discussion and analysis on january 1, 2015, cbpa began reporting risk-weighted assets based on basel iii standardized transitional rules. the conversion from basel i rules resulted in a $705 million increase in rwas as of december 31, 2014. this increase was primarily driven by risk-weight changes for off-balance sheet commitments with an original maturity one year or less, securitizations and the removal of the cap on otc derivatives.
cbpa risk-weighted assets based on basel iii standardized transitional rules at december 31, 2015 were $23.2 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion as compared to december 31, 2014. the primary drivers for this change were the adoption of the basel iii standardized approach, as well as growth in commercial, student loans and purchased auto loan exposures.
as of december 31, 2015, the cbpa tier 1 leverage ratio decreased approximately 37 basis points, driven by an increase in adjusted quarterly average total assets of $1.8 billion resulting in a 52 basis point decline in the ratio, partially offset by a 15 basis point increase resulting from higher cet1 capital described above.
liquidity we define liquidity as an institution's ability to meet its cash-flow and collateral obligations in a timely manner, at a reasonable cost. an institution must maintain current liquidity to fund its daily operations and forecasted cash-flow needs as well as contingent liquidity to deliver funding in a stress scenario. we consider the effective and prudent management of liquidity to be fundamental to our health and strength.
we manage liquidity at the consolidated enterprise level and at each material legal entity, including us, cbna and cbpa.
cfg liquidity our primary sources of cash are (i) dividends and interest received from our banking subsidiaries as a result of investing in bank equity and subordinated debt and (ii) externally issued subordinated debt. our uses of liquidity include the following: (i) routine cash flow requirements as a bank holding company, including payments of dividends, interest and expenses; (ii) needs of subsidiaries, including our banking subsidiaries, for additional equity and, as required, their needs for debt financing; and (iii) extraordinary requirements for cash.
on july 31, 2015, we issued $250 million aggregate principal amount 4.350% subordinated notes due 2025 in a public underwritten offering. we used the net proceeds of this offering to repurchase 9,615,384 shares of our outstanding common stock directly from rbs at $26.00 per share.
our cash and cash equivalents represent a source of liquidity that can be used to meet various needs. as of december 31, 2015, we held cash and cash equivalents of approximately $400 million, which should be viewed as a liquidity reserve.
our liquidity risk is low for the following reasons: (i) we have no material non-banking subsidiaries, and our banking subsidiaries are self-funding; (ii) we have no outstanding senior debt at the cfg level; (iii) the capital structures of our banking subsidiaries are similar to our capital structure. as of december 31, 2015, our double leverage ratio (the combined equity of our subsidiaries divided by our equity) was 101.4%; and, (iv) our other cash flow requirements, such as operating expenses, are relatively small.
banking subsidiaries' liquidity in the ordinary course of business, the liquidity of cbna and cbpa is managed by matching sources and uses of cash. the primary sources of bank liquidity include (i) deposits from our consumer and commercial franchise customers; (ii) payments of principal and interest on loans and debt securities; and (iii) wholesale borrowings, as needed, and as described under "-liquidity risk management and governance." the primary uses of bank liquidity include (i) withdrawals and maturities of deposits; (ii) payment of interest on deposits; (iii) funding of loan commitments; and (iv) funding of securities purchases. to the extent that the banks have relied on wholesale borrowings, uses also include payments of related principal and interest.
our banking subsidiaries' major businesses involve taking deposits and making loans. hence, a key role of liquidity management is to ensure that customers have timely access to funds from deposits and loans. liquidity management also involves maintaining sufficient liquidity to repay wholesale borrowings, pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding requirements when necessary.
from an external issuance perspective, during 2014, we created a $3.0 billion global note program for cbna. on december 3, 2015, cbna issued $750 million in three-year fixed-rate senior notes under this program. this debt represents a key source of unsecured, term, and stable funding, further diversifies the funding sources of cbna, and creates a more peer-like funding structure for the consolidated enterprise. additionally, on december 1, 2014, cbna issued $1.5 billion in senior notes under this program, consisting of $750 million of three-year fixed-rate notes and $750 million in five-year fixed-rate notes.

management's discussion and analysis liquidity risk we define liquidity risk as the risk that an entity will be unable to meet our payment obligations in a timely manner. we manage liquidity risk at the consolidated enterprise level, and for each material legal entity including us, cbna and cbpa. liquidity risk can arise due to contingent liquidity risk and/or funding liquidity risk.
contingent liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions may reduce an entity's ability to liquidate, pledge and/or finance certain assets and thereby substantially reduce the liquidity value of such assets. drivers of contingent liquidity risk include general market disruptions as well as specific issues regarding the credit quality and/or valuation of a security or loan, issuer or borrower and/or asset class.
funding liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions and/or entity-specific events may reduce an entity's ability to raise funds from depositors and/or wholesale market counterparties. drivers of funding liquidity risk may be idiosyncratic or systemic, reflecting impediments to operations and/or undermining of market confidence.
factors affecting liquidity given the composition of their assets and borrowing sources, contingent liquidity at both cbna and cbpa would be materially affected by such events as deterioration of financing markets for high-quality securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities and other instruments issued by the gnma, fnma and the fhlmc), by any inability of the fhlbs to provide collateralized advances and/or by a refusal of the frb to act as lender of last resort in systemic stress. given the quality of our unencumbered securities, the positive track record of the fhlbs in stress and the commitment of the frb to continue as lender of last resort in systemic stress scenarios, we view contingent liquidity risk at our banking subsidiaries, both cbna and cbpa, to be relatively modest, given the size and configuration of their respective balance sheets.
given the structure of their balance sheets, funding liquidity of cbna and cbpa would be materially affected by an adverse idiosyncratic event (e.g., a major loss, causing a perceived or actual deterioration in its financial condition), an adverse systemic event (e.g., default or bankruptcy of a significant capital markets participant), or a combination of both (e.g., the financial crisis of 2008-2010). however, during the financial crisis, our banking subsidiaries reduced their dependence on unsecured wholesale funding to virtually zero. consequently, and despite ongoing exposure to a variety of idiosyncratic and systemic events, we view our funding liquidity risk to be relatively modest.
an additional variable affecting our access, and the access of our banking subsidiaries, to unsecured wholesale market funds and to large denomination (i.e., uninsured) customer deposits is the credit ratings assigned by such agencies as moody's, standard & poor's and fitch. the following table presents our credit ratings:

nr = not rated changes in our public credit ratings could affect both the cost and availability of our wholesale funding. as a result and in order to maintain a conservative funding profile, our banking subsidiaries continue to minimize reliance on unsecured wholesale funding. at december 31, 2015, the majority of wholesale funding consisted of secured borrowings primarily fhlb advances secured primarily by high-quality residential loan collateral. our dependence on short-term, unsecured and credit-sensitive funding continues to be relatively low.

management's discussion and analysis existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements represent another key driver of systemic liquidity conditions and liquidity management practices. the frbg evaluates our liquidity as part of the supervisory process, and the federal reserve board recently issued regulations that will require us to conduct regular liquidity stress testing over various time horizons and to maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets sufficient to cover expected net cash outflows and projected loss or impairment of funding sources for a short-term liquidity stress scenario. in addition, the basel committee has developed a set of internationally-agreed upon quantitative liquidity metrics: the lcr and the nsfr.
the lcr was developed to ensure banks have sufficient high-quality liquid assets to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30-day liquidity stress period. in september 2014, the u.s. federal banking regulators published the final rule to implement the lcr. this rule also introduced a modified version of the lcr in the united states, which generally applies to bhcs not active internationally (institutions with less than $10 billion of on-balance sheet foreign exposure), with total assets of greater than $50 billion but less than $250 billion. under this definition, we are designated as a modified lcr company. as compared to the basel committee's version of the lcr, the version of the lcr issued by the u.s. federal banking regulators includes a narrower definition of high-quality liquid assets, different prescribed cash inflow and outflow assumptions for certain types of instruments and transactions and a shorter phase-in schedule that began on january 1, 2015 and ends on january 1, 2017. notably, as a modified lcr company, we were required to be 90% compliant beginning in january 2016, and 100% compliant beginning in january 2017. achieving sustainable lcr compliance may require changes in the size and/or composition of our investment portfolio, the configuration of our discretionary wholesale funding portfolio, and our average cash position. we were compliant with the lcr as of december 31, 2015, and we were fully compliant with the lcr as of the required implementation date of january 2016.
the nsfr was developed to provide a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities and has a time horizon of one year. the basel committee contemplates that the nsfr, including any revisions, will be implemented as a minimum standard by january 1, 2018; however, the u.s. federal banking regulators have not yet published a proposed rule to implement the nsfr in the united states.
we continue to review and monitor these liquidity requirements to develop appropriate implementation plans and liquidity strategies. we expect to be fully compliant with the final rules on or prior to the applicable effective date.
liquidity risk management and governance liquidity risk is measured and managed by the funding and liquidity unit within our treasury unit in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our board and the asset and liability management committee. in managing liquidity risk, the funding and liquidity unit delivers regular and comprehensive reporting, including current levels versus threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics, explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and, as appropriate, recommended remedial strategies.
the mission of our funding and liquidity unit is to deliver prudent levels of current, projected and contingent liquidity from stable sources, in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost, without significant adverse consequences.
we seek to accomplish this mission by funding loans with stable deposits; by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding, particularly short-term unsecured funding; and by maintaining ample available liquidity, including a contingent liquidity buffer of unencumbered high-quality loans and securities.
as of december 31, 2015:
•   core deposits, including loans and deposits held for sale, continued to be our primary source of funding and our consolidated year-end loan-to-deposit ratio was 96.9%;
•   short-term unsecured wholesale funding was $527 million, substantially offset by our net overnight position (which is defined as excess cash balances held at the federal reserve banks plus federal funds sold minus federal funds purchased) of $2.0 billion;
•   contingent liquidity was $23.1 billion; net overnight position (defined above), totaled $2.0 billion; unencumbered liquid securities totaled $17.0 billion; and available fhlb capacity primarily secured by mortgage loans totaled $4.1 billion; and
•   available discount window capacity, defined as available total borrowing capacity from the federal reserve based on identified collateral, is secured by non-mortgage commercial and consumer loans and totaled $11.0 billion. use of this borrowing capacity would likely be considered only during exigent circumstances.

management's discussion and analysis the funding and liquidity unit monitors a variety of liquidity and funding metrics, including specific risk threshold limits. the metrics are broadly classified as follows:
•   current liquidity sources and capacities, including excess cash at the federal reserve banks, free and liquid securities and available and secured fhlb borrowing capacity;
•   contingent stressed liquidity, including idiosyncratic, systemic and combined stress scenarios, in addition to evolving regulatory requirements such as the lcr and the nsfr; and
•   current and prospective exposures, including secured and unsecured wholesale funding and spot and cumulative cash-flow gaps across a variety of horizons.
further, certain of these metrics are monitored for each of us, our banking subsidiaries, and for our consolidated enterprise on a daily basis, including net overnight position, unencumbered securities, internal liquidity, available fhlb borrowing capacity and total contingent liquidity. in order to identify emerging trends and risks and inform funding decisions, specific metrics are also forecasted over a one-year horizon.
cash flows from operating activities contributed $1.2 billion in 2015. net cash used by investing activities was $5.9 billion, primarily reflecting net securities available for sale portfolio purchases of $6.8 billion and a net increase in loans and leases of $6.0 billion, partially offset by proceeds from maturities, paydowns and sales of securities available for sale of $7.3 billion. cash provided by financing activities was $4.5 billion, driven by a net increase in deposits of $6.8 billion and proceeds from long-term borrowed funds of $6.8 billion, partially offset by a decrease in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase of $3.5 billion, a decrease in other short-term borrowed funds of $4.4 billion and repayments of long-term borrowed funds of $766 million. these activities represented a cumulative decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $191 million, which, when added to the cash and cash equivalents balance of $3.3 billion at the beginning of the year, resulted in an ending balance of cash and cash equivalents of $3.1 billion as of december 31, 2015.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, our operating activities contributed $1.4 billion in net cash, including an increase in other liabilities, which added $239 million, and an increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion, which added $386 million, partially offset by an increase in other assets of $295 million and a gain on sale of deposits of $286 million. for the year ended december 31, 2014, net cash used by investing activities was $10.3 billion, primarily reflecting net securities available for sale portfolio purchases of $8.3 billion, a net increase in loans and leases of $6.9 billion and securities held to maturity portfolio purchases of $1.2 billion, partially offset by proceeds from maturities, paydowns and sales of securities available for sale of $6.3 billion. cash provided by financing activities was $9.4 billion, including a net increase in other short-term borrowed funds of $4.0 billion and a net increase in deposits of $3.8 billion. these activities represented a cumulative increase in cash and cash equivalents of $519 million, which, when added to the cash and cash equivalents balance of $2.8 billion at the beginning of the year, resulted in an ending balance of cash and cash equivalents of $3.3 billion as of december 31, 2014.

critical accounting estimates our audited consolidated financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this report, are prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our audited consolidated financial statements.
an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our audited consolidated financial statements. estimates are made using facts and circumstances known at a point in time. changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates. the most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below.

management's discussion and analysis allowance for credit losses management's estimate of probable losses in our loan and lease portfolios including unfunded lending commitments is recorded in the alll and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date. our determination of such estimates is based on a periodic evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded credit facilities, as well as other relevant factors. this evaluation is inherently subjective and requires significant estimates and judgments of underlying factors, all of which are susceptible to change.
the alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments could be affected by a variety of internal and external factors. internal factors include portfolio performance such as delinquency levels, assigned risk ratings, the mix and level of loan balances, differing economic risks associated with each loan category and the financial condition of specific borrowers. external factors include fluctuations in the general economy, unemployment rates, bankruptcy filings, developments within a particular industry, changes in collateral values and factors particular to a specific commercial credit such as competition, business and management performance. the alll may be adjusted to reflect our current assessment of various qualitative risks, factors and events that may not be measured in our statistical procedures. there is no certainty that the alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments will be appropriate over time to cover losses because of unanticipated adverse changes in any of these internal, external or qualitative factors.
the evaluation of the adequacy of the commercial, commercial real estate, and lease alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments is primarily based on risk rating models that assess probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default on an individual loan basis. the models are primarily driven by individual customer financial characteristics and are validated against historical experience. additionally, qualitative factors may be included in the risk rating models. after the aggregation of individual borrower incurred loss, additional overlays can be made based on back-testing against historical losses and forward loss curve ratios.
for nonaccruing commercial and commercial real estate loans with an outstanding balance of $3 million or greater and for all commercial and commercial real estate tdrs (regardless of size), we conduct specific analysis on a loan level basis to determine the probable amount of credit loss. if appropriate, a specific alll is established for the loan through a charge to the provision for credit losses. for all classes of impaired loans, individual loan measures of impairment may result in a charge-off to the alll, if deemed appropriate. in such cases, the provision for credit losses is not affected when a specific reserve for at least that amount already exists. techniques utilized include comparing the loan's carrying amount to the estimated present value of its future cash flows, the fair value of its underlying collateral, or the loan's observable market price. the technique applied to each impaired loan is based on the workout officer's opinion of the most probable workout scenario. historically, this has generally led to the use of the estimated present value of future cash flows approach. the fair value of underlying collateral will be used if the loan is deemed collateral dependent. for loans that use the fair value of underlying collateral approach, a charge-off assessment is performed quarterly to write the loans down to fair value.
for most non-impaired retail loan portfolio types, the alll is based upon the incurred loss model utilizing the pd, lgd and exposure at default on an individual loan basis. when developing these factors, we may consider the loan product and collateral type, ltv ratio, lien position, borrower's credit, time outstanding, geographic location, delinquency status and incurred loss period. incurred loss periods are reviewed and updated at least annually, and potentially more frequently when economic situations change rapidly, as they tend to fluctuate with economic cycles. incurred loss periods are generally longer in good economic times and shorter in bad times. certain retail portfolios, including sbo home equity loans, student loans, and credit card receivables utilize roll rate models to estimate the alll. for the portfolios measured using the incurred loss model, roll rate models are also used to support management overlays if deemed necessary.
for home equity lines and loans, a number of factors impact the pd. specifically, the borrower's current fico score, the utilization rate, delinquency statistics, borrower income, current cltv ratio and months on books are all used to assess the borrower's creditworthiness. similarly, the loss severity is also impacted by various factors, including the utilization rate, the cltv ratio, the lien position, the housing price index change for the location (as measured by the case-shiller index), months on books and current loan balance.
when we are not in a first lien position, we use delinquency information on the first lien exposures obtained from third-party credit information providers in the credit assessment. for all first liens, whether owned by a third party or by us, an additional assessment is performed on a quarterly basis. in this assessment, the most recent three months' performance of the senior liens is reviewed for delinquency (90 days or more past due), modification, foreclosure and/or bankruptcy statuses. if any derogatory status is present, the junior lien will be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of its delinquency status on our books. this subsequent change to nonaccrual status will alter the treatment in the pd model, thus affecting the reserve calculation.
in addition, the first lien exposure is combined with the second lien exposure to generate a cltv. the cltv is a more accurate reflection of the leverage of the borrower against the property value, as compared to the ltv from just the junior lien(s). the cltv is used for modeling both the junior lien pd and lgd. this also impacts the alll rates for the junior lien helocs.
94
citizens financial group, inc.
management's discussion and analysis the above measures are all used to assess the pd and lgd for heloc borrowers for whom we originated the loans. there is also a portfolio of home equity products that were originated and serviced by others; however, we currently service some of the loans in this portfolio. the sbo portfolio is modeled as a separate class and the reserves for this class are generated by using the delinquency roll rate models as described below.
for retail tdrs that are not collateral-dependent, allowances are developed using the present value of expected future cash flows, compared to the recorded investment in the loans. expected re-default factors are considered in this analysis. retail tdrs that are deemed collateral-dependent are written down to the fair market value of the collateral less costs to sell. the fair value of collateral is periodically monitored subsequent to the modification.
changes in the levels of estimated losses, even if minor, can significantly affect management's determination of an appropriate alll. for consumer loans, losses are affected by such factors as loss severity, collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. a 1% and 5% increase in the estimated loss rate for consumer loans at december 31, 2015 would have increased the alll by $5 million and $26 million, respectively. the alll for our commercial banking segment is sensitive to assigned credit risk ratings and inherent loss rates. if 10% and 20% of the december 31, 2015 year end loan balances (including unfunded commitments) within each risk rating category of our commercial banking segment had experienced downgrades of two risk categories, the alll would have increased by $36 million and $72 million, respectively.
commercial loans and leases are charged off to the alll when there is little prospect of collecting either principal or interest. charge-offs of commercial loans and leases usually involve receipt of borrower-specific adverse information. for commercial collateral-dependent loans, an appraisal or other valuation is used to quantify a shortfall between the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell and the recorded investment in the commercial loan. retail loan charge-offs are generally based on established delinquency thresholds rather than borrower-specific adverse information. when a loan is collateral-dependent, any shortfalls between the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell and the recorded investment is promptly charged off. placing any loan or lease on nonaccrual status does not by itself require a partial or total charge-off; however, any identified losses are charged off at that time.
for additional information regarding the alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments, see note 1 "significant accounting policies" and note 5 "allowance for credit losses, nonperforming assets and concentrations of credit risk" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included elsewhere in this report.
fair value we measure fair value using the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. fair value is based upon quoted market prices in an active market, where available. if quoted prices are not available, observable market-based inputs or independently sourced parameters are used to develop fair value, whenever possible. such inputs may include prices of similar assets or liabilities, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speeds and foreign exchange rates.
we classify our assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value in accordance with the three-level valuation hierarchy:
•   level 1. quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
•   level 2. observable inputs other than level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar instruments; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and
•   level 3. unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market information and that are significant to the fair value measurement.
classification in the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability. for instruments classified in level 1 and 2 where inputs are primarily based upon observable market data, there is less judgment applied in arriving at the fair value. for instruments classified in level 3, management judgment is more significant due to the lack of observable market data.
significant assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis include our mortgage-backed securities available for sale. these instruments are priced using an external pricing service and are classified as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. the service's pricing models use predominantly observable valuation inputs to measure the fair value of these securities under both the market and income approaches. the pricing service utilizes a matrix pricing methodology to price our u.s. agency pass-through securities, which involves making adjustments to to-be-announced security prices based on a matrix of various mortgage-backed securities characteristics such as weighted-average maturities, indices and other pool-level information. other agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities are priced using a discounted cash flow methodology. this methodology includes estimating the cash flows expected to be received for each security using projected prepayment speeds and default rates based on historical
95
citizens financial group, inc.
management's discussion and analysis statistics of the underlying collateral and current market conventions. these estimated cash flows are then discounted using market-based discount rates that incorporate characteristics such as average life, volatility, ratings, performance of the underlying collateral, and prevailing market conditions.
we review and update the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs in fair value measurements may result in a reclassification between the fair value hierarchy levels and are recognized based on year-end balances. we also verify the accuracy of the pricing provided by our primary external pricing service on a quarterly basis. this process involves using a secondary external vendor to provide valuations for our securities portfolio for comparison purposes. any securities with discrepancies beyond a certain threshold are researched and, if necessary, valued by an independent outside broker.
fair value is also used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate certain assets for impairment or for disclosure purposes. examples of nonrecurring uses of fair value include mortgage servicing rights accounted for by the amortization method, loan impairments for certain loans and goodwill.
for additional information regarding our fair value measurements, see note 1 "significant accounting policies," note 3 "securities," note 10 "mortgage banking," and note 16 "derivatives" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included elsewhere in this report.
goodwill goodwill is an asset that represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to annual impairment tests. goodwill is assigned to reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded. a reporting unit is a business operating segment or a component of a business operating segment. once goodwill has been assigned to reporting units, it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition, and all of the activities within a reporting unit, whether acquired or organically grown, are available to support the value of the goodwill.
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step test. the first step, used to identify potential impairment, involves comparing each reporting unit's fair value to its carrying value including goodwill. if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, applicable goodwill is deemed to be not impaired. if the carrying value exceeds fair value, there is an indication of impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment.
the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated impairment. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination, which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in the first step, over the aggregate fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangible assets as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. an impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit, and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill. subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted.
we review goodwill for impairment annually as of october 31 or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one or more reporting units is below its carrying value. we rely on the income approach (discounted cash flow method) as the primary method for determining fair value. market-based methods are used as benchmarks to corroborate the value determined by the discounted cash flow method.
we rely on several assumptions when estimating the fair value of our reporting units using the discounted cash flow method. these assumptions include the current discount rate, as well as projected loan losses, income taxes and capital retention rates. discount rates are estimated based on the capital asset pricing model, which considers the risk-free interest rate, market risk premium, beta and unsystematic risk and size premium adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit. the discount rates are also calibrated on the assessment of the risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit. multi-year financial forecasts are developed for each reporting unit by considering several key business drivers such as new business initiatives, customer retention standards, market share changes, anticipated loan and deposit growth, forward interest rates, historical performance and industry and economic trends, among other considerations. the long-term growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit was estimated based on management's assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit, as well as broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product and inflation.
we corroborate the fair value of our reporting units determined by the discounted cash flow method using market-based methods: a comparable company method and a comparable transaction method. the comparable company method measures fair value of a business by comparing it to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. this involves identifying and selecting the comparable companies based on a number of factors (i.e., size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment), calculating
96
citizens financial group, inc.
management's discussion and analysis the market multiples (i.e., price-to-tangible book value, price-to-cash earnings and price-to-net income) of these comparable companies and then applying these multiples to our operating results to estimate the value of the reporting unit's equity on a marketable, minority basis. a control premium is then applied to this value to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit on a marketable, controlling basis. the comparable transaction method measures fair value of a business based on exchange prices in actual transactions and on asking prices for controlling interests in public or private companies currently offered for sale. the process involves comparison and correlation of us with other similar companies. adjustments for differences in factors described earlier (i.e., size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment) are also considered.
as a best practice, we also corroborate the fair value of our reporting units determined by the discounted cash flow method by adding the aggregated sum of these fair value measurements to the fair value of our non-segment operations and comparing this total to our observed market capitalization. as part of this process, we analyze the implied control premium to evaluate its reasonableness. all facts and circumstances are considered when completing this analysis, including observed transaction data and any additional external evidence supporting the implied control premium. since none of our reporting units are publicly traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations cannot be directly correlated to cfg's common stock price. the sum of the fair values of the reporting units at october 31, 2015 exceeded the overall market capitalization of cfg as of october 31, 2015. although we believe it is reasonable to conclude that market capitalization could be an indicator of fair value over time, we do not believe that our current market capitalization reflects the aggregate fair value of our individual reporting units.
the valuation of goodwill is dependent on forward-looking expectations related to the performance of the u.s. economy and our associated financial performance. the prolonged delay in the full recovery of the u.s. economy, and the impact of that delay on earnings expectations, prompted a goodwill impairment test as of june 30, 2013. although the u.s. economy has demonstrated signs of recovery, notably improvements in unemployment and housing, the pace and extent of recovery in these indicators, as well as in overall gross domestic product, have lagged previous expectations. the impact of the slow recovery is most evident in our consumer banking reporting unit. accordingly, the percentage by which the estimated fair value of our consumer banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying value declined from 7% at december 31, 2011 to 5% at december 31, 2012.
during the first half of 2013, we observed further deceleration of expected growth for our consumer banking reporting unit's future profits based on forecasted economic growth for the u.s. economy and the continuing impact of the new regulatory framework in the financial industry. this deceleration was incorporated into our revised earnings forecast in the second quarter of 2013, and we subsequently concluded that there was a likelihood of greater than 50% that goodwill impairment had occurred as of june 30, 2013.
an interim goodwill impairment test was subsequently performed for our consumer banking and commercial banking reporting units. step one of these tests indicated that (1) the fair value of our consumer banking reporting unit was less than its carrying value by 19% and (2) the fair value of our commercial banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 27%. step two of the goodwill impairment test was subsequently performed for our consumer banking reporting unit, which resulted in the recognition of a pre-tax $4.4 billion impairment charge in our consolidated statement of operations for the period ending june 30, 2013. the impairment charge, which was a non-cash item, had minimal impact on our tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios. the impairment charge had no impact on our liquidity position or tangible common equity.
we performed an annual test for impairment of goodwill for both reporting units as of october 31, 2015. as of this testing date, the percentage by which the fair value of our consumer banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying value was 6%, and the percentage by which the fair value of our commercial banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying value was 8%.
we based the fair value estimates used in our annual goodwill impairment testing on assumptions we believe to be representative of assumptions that a market participant would use in valuing the reporting units but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain, including estimates of future growth rates and operating margins and assumptions about the overall economic climate and the competitive environment for our reporting units. there can be no assurances that future estimates and assumptions made for purposes of goodwill testing will prove accurate predictions of the future. if the assumptions regarding business plans, competitive environments, market conditions or anticipated growth rates are not achieved, or a market participant view of our total fair value declines, we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods.

management's discussion and analysis income taxes accrued income taxes are reported as a component of either other assets or other liabilities, as appropriate, in the consolidated balance sheets and reflect our estimate of income taxes to be paid or that effectively have been prepaid. deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the amount of future income taxes to be paid or that effectively have been prepaid, and the net balance is reported as an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets. we determine the realization of the deferred tax asset based upon an evaluation of the four possible sources of taxable income: (1) the future reversals of taxable temporary differences; (2) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards; (3) taxable income in prior carryback years; and (4) tax planning strategies. in projecting future taxable income, we utilize forecasted pre-tax earnings, adjust for the estimated book tax differences and incorporate assumptions, including the amount of income allocable to taxing jurisdictions. these assumptions require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage the underlying businesses. the realization of the deferred tax assets could be reduced in the future if these estimates are significantly different than forecasted.
we are subject to income tax in the united states and multiple state and local jurisdictions. the tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction may be interpreted differently in certain situations, which could result in a range of outcomes. thus, we are required to exercise judgment regarding the application of these tax laws and regulations. we evaluate and recognize tax liabilities related to any tax uncertainties. due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may differ from the current estimate of tax liabilities or refunds.
our estimate of accrued income taxes, deferred income taxes and income tax expense can also change in any period as a result of new legislative or judicial guidance impacting tax positions, as well as changes in income tax rates. any changes, if they occur, can be significant to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

risk governance we are committed to maintaining a strong, integrated and proactive approach to the management of all risks to which we are exposed in pursuit of our business objectives. a key aspect of our board's responsibility as the main decision making body is setting our risk appetite to ensure that the levels of risk that we are willing to accept in the attainment of our strategic business and financial objectives are clearly understood.
to enable the board to carry out its objectives, it has delegated authority for risk management activities, as well as governance and oversight of those activities, to a number of board and executive management level risk committees. the key committees that specifically consider risk across the enterprise are set out in the diagram below.

management's discussion and analysis chief risk officer the cro directs our overall risk management function overseeing the credit, interest rate , market, liquidity, operational, compliance, strategic and reputational risk management. the cro reports to our ceo and to the board risk committee.
risk framework our risk management framework is embedded in our business through a "three lines of defense" model which defines responsibilities and accountabilities.
first line of defense the business lines (including their associated support functions) are the first line of defense and are accountable for owning and managing, within our defined risk appetite, the risks which exist in their respective business areas. the business lines are responsible for performing regular risk assessments to identify and assess the material risks that arise in their area of responsibility, complying with relevant risk policies, testing and certifying the adequacy and effectiveness of their controls on a regular basis, establishing and documenting operating procedures and establishing and owning a governance structure for identifying and managing risk.
second line of defense the second line of defense includes independent monitoring and control functions accountable for developing and ensuring implementation of risk and control frameworks and related policies. this centralized risk function is appropriately independent from the business and is accountable for overseeing and challenging our business lines on the effective management of their risks. this risk function utilizes training, communications and awareness to provide expert support and advice to the business lines. this includes interpreting the risk policy standards and risk management framework, overseeing compliance by the businesses with policies and responsibilities, including providing relevant management information and escalating concerns where appropriate.
the executive risk committee, chaired by the cro, actively considers our inherent material risks, analyzes our overall risk profile and seeks confirmation that the risks are being appropriately identified, assessed and mitigated.
third line of defense our internal audit function is the third line of defense providing independent assurance with a view of the effectiveness of citizens' internal controls, governance practices, and culture so that risk is managed appropriately for the size, complexity, and risk profile of the organization. internal audit has complete and unrestricted access to any and all bank records, physical properties, and personnel. internal audit issues a report following each internal review and provides an audit opinion to citizens' audit committees on a quarterly basis.
credit quality assurance also reports to the chief audit executive and also provides the boards, senior management and other stakeholders with independent assurance on the quality of credit portfolios and adherence to agreed credit risk appetite and credit policies and processes. in line with its procedures and regulatory expectations, the credit quality assurance function undertakes a program of portfolio testing, assessing and reporting through four risk pillars of asset quality, rating and data integrity, risk management and credit risk appetite.
risk appetite risk appetite is a strategic business and risk management tool. we define our risk appetite as the maximum limit of acceptable risk beyond which we would either be unable to achieve our strategic objectives and capital adequacy obligations or would assume an unacceptable amount of risk to do so. the board risk committee advises our board of directors in relation to current and potential future risk strategies, including determination of risk appetite and tolerance.
the principal non-market risks to which we are subject are: credit risk, operational risk, liquidity risk, strategic risk and reputational risk. we are also subject to market risks. market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and/or other relevant market rates or prices. modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs, including hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk. as described below, more material market risk arises from our non-trading banking activities, such as loan origination and deposit gathering. we have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market risk. we actively manage both trading and non-trading market risks. we are also subject to liquidity risk, discussed under "-liquidity."
our risk appetite framework and risk limit structure establishes guidelines to determine the balance between existing and desired levels of risk and supports the implementation, measurement and management of our risk appetite.

management's discussion and analysis credit risk overview credit risk represents the potential for loss arising from a customer, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform in accordance with the contractual terms of the obligation. while the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities, we do engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing, asset and liability management, and trading activities. given the financial impact of credit risk on our earnings and balance sheet, the assessment, approval, and management of credit risk represents a major part of our overall risk-management responsibility.
objective the credit risk management organization is responsible for approving credit transactions, monitoring portfolio performance, identifying problem loans, and ensuring remedial management.
organizational structure management and oversight of credit risk is the responsibility of both the line of business and the second line of defense. the second line of defense, the independent credit risk function, is led by the chief credit officer who oversees all of our credit risk. the cco reports to the chief risk officer. the cco, acting in a manner consistent with board policies, has responsibility for, among other things, the governance process around policies, procedures, risk acceptance criteria, credit risk appetite, limits, and authority delegation. the cco and his team also have responsibility for credit approvals for larger or more risky transactions and oversight of line of business credit risk activities. reporting to the cco are the heads of the second line of defense credit functions specializing in: consumer banking; business banking; commercial banking; citizens restructuring management; portfolio analytics and reporting; and credit policy and administration. each team under these leaders is composed of highly experienced credit professionals.
the credit risk teams operate independently from the business lines to ensure decisions are not influenced by unbalanced objectives.
governance the primary mechanisms used to govern our credit risk function are our consumer and commercial credit policies. these policies outline the minimum acceptable lending standards that align with our desired risk appetite. material issues or changes are identified by the individual committees and presented to the credit policy committee, executive risk committee and the board risk committee for approval as appropriate.
key management processes to ensure credit risks are managed within our risk appetite and business and risk strategies are achieved, we employ a comprehensive and integrated control program. the program's objective is to proactively (1) identify, (2) measure, (3) monitor, and (4) mitigate existing and emerging credit risks across the credit lifecycle (origination, account management/portfolio management, and loss mitigation and recovery).
consumer on the consumer banking side of credit risk, our teams use models to evaluate consumer loans across the lifecycle of the loan. starting at origination, credit scoring models are used to forecast the probability of default of an applicant. these models are embedded in the loan origination system, which allows for real-time scoring and automated decisions for many of our products. periodic validations are performed on our purchased and proprietary scores to ensure fit for purpose. when approving customers for a new loan or extension of an existing credit line, credit scores are used in conjunction with other credit risk variables such as affordability, length of term, collateral value, collateral type, and lien subordination.
the origination process is supported by dedicated underwriting teams that reside in the business line. the size of each team depends on the intensity of the approval process as the number of handoffs, documentation, and verification requirements differ substantially depending on the loan product.
to ensure proper oversight of the underwriting teams, lending authority is granted by the second line of defense credit risk function to each underwriter. the amount of delegated authority depends on the experience of the individual. we periodically evaluate the performance of each underwriter and annually reauthorize their delegated authority. only senior members of the second line of defense credit risk team are authorized to approve significant exceptions to credit policies. it is not uncommon to make exceptions to established policies when compensating factors are present. there are exception limits which, when reached, trigger a comprehensive analysis.
100
citizens financial group, inc.
management's discussion and analysis once an account is established, credit scores and collateral values are refreshed at regular intervals to allow for proactive identification of increasing or decreasing levels of credit risk. for accounts with contingent liability (revolving feature), credit policies have been developed that leverage the refreshed customer data to determine if a credit line should be increased, decreased, frozen, or closed. lastly, behavioral modeling, segmentation, and loan modifications are used to cure delinquency, reduce the severity of loss, and maximize recoveries. our approach to managing credit risk is highly analytical and, where appropriate, is automated, to ensure consistency and efficiency.
the credit risk team is constantly evaluating current and projected economic conditions, internal credit performance in relation to budget and predefined risk tolerances, and current and expected regulatory guidance to determine the optimal balance of expansion and contraction policies. all policy change proposals receive intense scrutiny and discussion prior to approval and implementation. this process ensures decisions are made based on risk-based analytics with full adherence to regulatory requirements.
commercial on the commercial banking side of credit risk, the structure is broken into c&i loans and leases and cre. within c&i there are separate verticals established for certain specialty products (e.g., asset-based lending, leasing, franchise finance, health care, technology, mid-corporate). a "specialty vertical" is a stand-alone team of industry or product specialists. substantially all activity that falls under the ambit of the defined industry or product is managed through a specialty vertical when one exists. cre also operates as a specialty vertical.
commercial credit risk management begins with defined credit products and policies.
commercial transactions are subject to individual analysis and approval at origination and, with few exceptions, are subject to a formal annual review requirement. the underwriting process includes the establishment and approval of credit grades that confirm the probability of default ("pd") and loss given default ("lgd"). approval then requires both a business line approver and an independent credit approver with the requisite level of delegated authority. the approval level of a particular credit facility is determined by the size of the credit relationship as well as the pd. the checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit approver function are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted, facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur, and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution. all authority to grant credit is delegated through the independent credit risk function and is closely monitored and regularly updated.
the primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower, assessment of the borrower's management capabilities, cash flows from operations, industry sector trends, type and sufficiency of collateral, type of exposure, transaction structure, and the general economic outlook. while these are the primary factors considered, there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process. in addition to the credit analysis conducted during the approval process at origination and annual review, our credit quality assurance group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the portfolio and new originations. this group conducts portfolio reviews on a risk-based cycle to evaluate individual loans, validate risk ratings, as well as test the consistency of the credit processes and the effectiveness of credit risk management.
the maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers. concentration risk is managed through limits on industry (sector), loan type (asset class), and loan quality factors. we focus predominantly on extending credit to commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary markets (for this purpose defined as our 11 state footprint plus contiguous states), although we do engage in lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe that the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives.
apart from industrials and cre (which together make up 30% of the commercial outstandings as of december 31, 2015), there are no material sector concentrations. as of december 31, 2015, our cre outstandings amounted to 9% of total loans and leases. the industrial sector includes basic c&i lending focused on general manufacturing. the sector is diversified and not managed as a specialized vertical. our customers are local to our market and present no significant concentration.
our credit grading system considers many components that directly correlate to loan quality and likelihood of repayment. our assessment of a borrower's credit strength is reflected in our risk ratings for such loans, which are also an integral component of our alll methodology. when deterioration in credit strength is noted, a loan becomes subject to watch review. the watch review process involves senior representatives from the business line portfolio management team, the independent credit risk team, and our citizens restructuring management group. as appropriate and consistent with regulatory definitions, the credit may be subject to classification as either criticized or classified, which would also trigger a credit rating downgrade. as such, the loan and relationship would be subject to more frequent review.
101
citizens financial group, inc.
management's discussion and analysis substantially all loans categorized as classified are managed by citizens restructuring management, a specialized group of credit professionals that handles the day-to-day management of workouts, commercial recoveries, and problem loan sales. its responsibilities include developing and implementing action plans, assessing risk ratings, determining the appropriateness of specific reserves relating to the loan, accrual status of the loan, and the ultimate collectability of loans in their portfolio.
market risk market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and/or other relevant market rates or prices. modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs, including hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk. as described below, more material market risk arises from our non-trading banking activities, such as loan origination and deposit-gathering. we have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market risk. we actively manage both trading and non-trading market risks.
non-trading risk we are exposed to market risk as a result of non-trading banking activities. this market risk is composed entirely of interest rate risk, as we have no direct currency or commodity risk and de minimis equity risk. this interest rate risk emerges from the balance sheet after the aggregation of our assets, liabilities and equity. we refer to this non-trading risk embedded in the balance sheet as "structural interest rate risk" or "interest rate risk in the banking book." our mortgage servicing rights assets also contain interest rate risk as the value of the fee stream is impacted by the level of long-term interest rates.
a major source of structural interest rate risk is a difference in the repricing of assets, on the one hand, and liabilities and equity, on the other. first, there are differences in the timing of rate changes reflecting the maturity and/or repricing of assets and liabilities. for example, the rate earned on a residential mortgage may be fixed for 30 years; the rate paid on a certificate of deposit may be fixed only for a few months. due to these timing differences, net interest income is sensitive to changes in the level and shape of the yield curve. second, there are differences in the drivers of rate changes of various assets and liabilities. for example, commercial loans may reprice based on one-month libor or prime; the rate paid on retail money market demand accounts may be only loosely correlated with libor and depend on competitive demand for funds. due to these basis differences, net interest income is sensitive to changes in spreads between certain indices or repricing rates.
another important source of structural interest rate risk relates to the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options. for example, most consumer loans can be prepaid without penalty; and most consumer deposits can be withdrawn without penalty. the exercise of such options by customers can exacerbate the timing differences discussed above.
a primary source of our structural interest rate risk relates to faster repricing of floating rate loans relative to the retail deposit funding. this source of asset sensitivity is concentrated at the short end of the yield curve. for the past seven years with the federal funds rate near zero, this risk has been asymmetrical with significantly more upside benefit than potential exposure. as rates have lifted from near zero given the fomc's december 2015 rate hike, exposure to declining rates has increased. the secondary source of our interest rate risk is driven by longer term rates comprising the rollover or reinvestment risk on fixed rate loans as well as the prepayment risk on mortgage related loans and securities funded by non-rate sensitive deposits and equity.
the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by the board. these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short-term and long-term horizons. to ensure that exposure to interest rate risk is managed within this risk appetite, we must both measure the exposure and, as necessary, hedge it. the treasury asset and liability management team is responsible for measuring, monitoring and reporting on the structural interest rate risk position. these exposures are reported on a monthly basis to the asset and liability committee (alco) and at board meetings.
we measure structural interest rate risk through a variety of metrics intended to quantify both short-term and long-term exposures. the primary method that we use to quantify interest rate risk is simulation analysis in which we model net interest income from assets, liabilities and hedge derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios over a three-year horizon. exposure to interest rate risk is reflected in the variation of forecasted net interest income across scenarios.
key assumptions in this simulation analysis relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads, the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments. the most material of these behavioral assumptions relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate (i.e., non-contractual) maturities as well as the pace of mortgage prepayments. assessments are periodically made by running sensitivity analysis of the impact of key assumptions. the results of these analyses are reported to alco.
as the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance, we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including a "most likely" (implied forward) scenario as well as a variety of deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios. these scenarios may assume gradual ramping of the overall level of interest rates, immediate shocks to the level of rates and various yield curve twists in which movements in short- or long-term rates predominate. generally,
102
citizens financial group, inc.
management's discussion and analysis projected net interest income in any interest rate scenario is compared to net interest income in a base case where market forward rates are realized.
the table below reports net interest income exposures against a variety of interest rate scenarios. exposures are measured as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous, or gradual parallel +/- 200 basis point moves in benchmark interest rates. the net interest income simulation analyses do not include possible future actions that management might undertake to mitigate this risk. the current limit is a decrease in net interest income of 10% related to an instantaneous +/- 200 basis point move. as the table illustrates, our balance sheet is asset-sensitive: net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates. exposure to a decline in interest rates is well within limit. it should be noted that the magnitude of any possible decline in interest rates is constrained by the low absolute starting levels of rates. while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis, we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact.
the table below summarizes our positioning in various parallel yield curve shifts:

as part of the routine risk management process, a wide variety of similar analysis are reported for each of the next three rolling years.
we also use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk, economic value of equity ("eve"), as a supplement to net interest income simulations. eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure over a long-term horizon. eve measures the extent to which the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuation in interest rates. this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. the change in value is expressed as a percentage of regulatory capital. the current risk limit is set at a decrease of 20% of regulatory capital given an instantaneous +/- 200 basis point change in interest rates. we are operating within that limit as of december 31, 2015.
we are asset sensitive and as such are positioned to benefit from an increase in interest rates. we have consistently maintained the level of overall asset sensitivity in a tight range of 6.1% to 7.2% over the past year, as defined by the +200 gradual change.
we also had market risk associated with the value of the mortgage servicing right assets, which are impacted by the level of interest rates. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, our mortgage servicing rights had a book value of $164 million and $166 million, respectively, and were carried at the lower of cost or fair value. as of december 31, 2015, and 2014, the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights was $178 million and $179 million, respectively. given low interest rates over recent years, there is a valuation allowance of $9 million and $18 million on the asset as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. depending on the interest rate environment, hedges may be used to stabilize the market value of the mortgage servicing right asset.
trading risk we are exposed to market risk primarily through client facilitation activities including derivatives and foreign exchange products. exposure is created as a result of changes in interest rates and related basis spreads and volatility, foreign exchange rates, and credit spreads on a select range of interest rates, foreign exchange and secondary loans instruments. these trading activities are conducted through our two banking subsidiaries, cbna and cbpa.
103
citizens financial group, inc.
management's discussion and analysis client facilitation activities consist primarily of interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts where we enter into offsetting trades with a separate counterparty or exchange to manage our market risk exposure. we will occasionally execute hedges against the spread that exists across the client facing trade and its offset in the market to maintain a low risk profile. in addition to the aforementioned activities, we operate a secondary loan trading desk with the objective to meet secondary liquidity needs of our issuing clients' transactions and investor clients. we do not engage in any trading activities with the intent to benefit from short term price differences.
we record interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts as derivative assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. trading assets and liabilities are carried at fair value with income earned related to these activities included in net interest income. changes in fair value of trading assets and liabilities are reflected in other income, a component of noninterest income on the consolidated statements of operations.
market risk governance our market risk framework currently leverages rbs technology platform to aggregate, measure and monitor exposure against market risk limits. as part of our separation from rbs, we have entered into a transitional services agreement pursuant to which rbs will continue to provide us with all necessary var and other risk measurements required for regulatory reporting related to interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange trading activities, as well as internal market risk reporting until the end of the transitional services agreement. during the term of the transitional services agreement, we are building out our own market risk organization and framework in order to gradually migrate away from reliance on services provided by rbs.
given the low level of traded market risk, we have received the support of our u.s. banking regulators for relying on rbs' market risk technology platform. in managing our market risk, dealing authorities represent a key control in the management of market risk by setting the scope within which the business is permitted to operate. dealing authorities are established jointly by designated senior business line and senior risk manager, and are reviewed at least annually. dealing authorities are structured to accommodate the client facing trades, market offset trades and sets of hedges needed to maintain a low risk profile. primary responsibility for keeping within established tolerances resides with the business. key risk indicators, including a combined var for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk, are monitored on a daily basis and reported against tolerances consistent with our risk appetite and business strategy to relevant business line management and risk counterparts.
market risk measurement we use var metrics, complemented with sensitivity analysis, market value and stress testing in measuring market risk. during the term of the transition services agreement, we will continue to leverage rbs market risk measurement models for our foreign exchange and interest rate products, which are described further below, that capture correlation effects and allow for aggregation of market risk across risk types, business lines and legal entities. we measure and monitor market risk for both management and regulatory capital purposes.
value-at-risk overview the market risk measurement model is based on historical simulation. the var measure estimates the extent of any fair value losses on trading positions that may occur due to broad market movements (general var) such as changes in the level of interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. it is calculated on the basis that current positions remain broadly unaltered over the course of a given holding period. it is assumed that markets are sufficiently liquid to allow the business to close its positions, if required, within this holding period. var's benefit is that it captures the historic correlations of a portfolio. based on the composition of our "covered positions," we also use a standardized add-on approach for the loan trading desk's specific risk capital which estimates the extent of any losses that may occur from factors other than broad market movements. in addition, for our secondary traded loans we calculate the var on the general interest rate risk embedded within the loans using a standalone model that replicates the general var methodology (the related capital is reflected on the "de minimis" line in the following section). the general var approach is expressed in terms of a confidence level over the past 500 trading days. the internal var measure (used as the basis of the main var trading limits) is a 99% confidence level with a one day holding period, meaning that a loss greater than the var is expected to occur, on average, on only one day in 100 trading days (i.e., 1% of the time). theoretically, there should be a loss event greater than var two to three times per year. the regulatory measure of var is done at a 99% confidence level with a 10-day holding period. the historical market data applied to calculate the var is updated on a 10 business day lag. refer to "market risk regulatory capital" below for details of our 10-day var metrics for the quarters ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, including high, low, average and period end value-at-risk for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks, as well as total var.
market risk regulatory capital effective january 1, 2013, the u.s. banking regulators adopted "risk-based capital guidelines: market risk" as the regulations covering the calculation of market risk capital (the "market risk rule"). the market risk rule, commonly known as

management's discussion and analysis basel 2.5, substantially modified the determination of market risk-weighted assets and implemented a more risk sensitive methodology for the risk inherent in certain trading positions categorized as "covered positions." for the purposes of the market risk rule, all of our client facing trades, market offset trades and sets of hedges needed to maintain a low risk profile to qualify as "covered positions." the internal var measure is calculated based on the same population of trades that is utilized for regulatory var. the following table shows the results of our modeled and non-modeled measures for regulatory capital calculations:

stressed var svar is an extension of var, but uses a longer historical look back horizon that is fixed from january 3, 2005. this is done not only to identify headline risks from more volatile periods, but also to provide a counter balance to var which may be low during periods of low volatility. the holding period for profit and loss determination is 10 days. svar is also a component of market risk regulatory capital. svar for us is calculated under its own dynamic window regime as compared to rbs' static svar window. in a dynamic window regime, values of the 10-day, 99% var are calculated over all possible 260-day periods that can be obtained from the complete historical data set. refer to "market risk regulatory capital" above for details of svar metrics, including high, low, average and period end svar for the combined portfolio.
sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor, such as a one basis point change in rates or credit spread. we conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates, basis spreads, foreign exchange exposures and option prices. whereas var is based on previous moves in market risk factors over recent periods, it may not be an accurate predictor of future market moves. sensitivity analysis complements var as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves and is an effective tool in evaluating the appropriateness of hedging strategies.
stress testing conducting a stress test of a portfolio consists of running risk models with the inclusion of key variables that simulate various historical or hypothetical scenarios. for historical stress tests, profit and loss results are simulated for selected time periods corresponding to the most volatile underlying returns while hypothetical stress tests aim to consider concentration risk, illiquidity under stressed market conditions and risk arising from the bank's trading activities that may not be fully captured by its other models. hypothetical scenarios also assume that the market moves happen simultaneously and that no repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as events unfold. we generate stress tests of our trading positions on a regular basis. for example, we currently include a stress test that simulates a lehman-type crisis scenario by taking the worst 10-day peak to trough moves for the various risk factors that go into var from that period, and assumes they occurred simultaneously.

management's discussion and analysis review of market risk measurement models is the responsibility of rbs risk analytics. aspects covered include challenging the assumptions used, the quantitative techniques employed and the theoretical justification underpinning them, and an assessment of the soundness of the required data over time. where possible, the quantitative impact of the major underlying modeling assumptions will be estimated (e.g., through developing alternative models). results of such reviews are shared with u.s. regulators. for the term of the transitional services agreement, we and rbs expect to utilize the same independently validated var model for both management and regulatory reporting purposes. rbs market risk teams, including those providing consultative services to us under the transitional services agreement, will conduct internal validation before a new or changed model element is implemented and before a change is made to a market data mapping. for example, rbs market risk teams also perform regular reviews of key risk factors that are used in the market risk measurement models to produce profit and loss vectors used in the var calculations. these internal validations are subject to independent re-validation by rbs risk analytics and, depending on the results of the impact assessment, notification to the appropriate regulatory authorities for rbs and us may be required.
var backtesting backtesting is one form of validation of the var model. the market risk rule requires a comparison of our internal var measure to the actual net trading revenue (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, intra-day trading and net interest income) for each day over the preceding year (the most recent 250 business days). any observed loss in excess of the var number is taken as an exception. the level of exceptions determines the multiplication factor used to derive the var and svar-based capital requirement for regulatory reporting purposes. we perform sub-portfolio backtesting as required under the market risk rule, and as approved by our banking regulators, for interest rate and foreign exchange positions. the following table shows our daily net trading revenue and total internal, modeled var for the quarters ended december 31, 2015, september 30, 2015, june 30, 2015 and march 31, 2015. beginning in the quarter ended september 30, 2015, as agreed with our banking regulators, we use a multiplication factor derived from our specific backtesting results and no longer that of rbs.

potential problem loans and leases this disclosure presents outstanding amounts as well as specific reserves for certain loans and leases where information about possible credit problems of borrowers causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present repayment terms. at december 31, 2015, we did not identify any potential problem loans or leases within the portfolio that were not already included in "-risk elements."
cross-border outstandings cross-border outstandings can include loans, receivables, interest-bearing deposits with other banks, other interest-bearing investments and other monetary assets that are denominated in either dollars or other non-local currency.
as of december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, there were no aggregate cross-border outstandings from borrowers or counterparties in any country that exceeded 1%, or were between 0.75% and 1% of consolidated total assets.

(1) as discussed in note 1 "significant accounting policies" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included elsewhere in this report, the alll is reviewed separately for commercial and retail loans, and the alll for each includes an adjustment for qualitative allowance that includes certain risks, factors and events that might not be measured in the statistical analysis. as a result of this adjustment, the unallocated allowance was absorbed into the separately measured commercial and retail qualitative allowance during 2013.
(2) our sbo portfolio consists of home equity loans and lines that were originally serviced by others. we now service a portion of this portfolio internally.
(3) during december 2013, we updated our estimate of the incurred loss period for certain residential mortgages. this change reflected an analysis of defaulted borrowers and aligned to management's view that incurred but unrealized losses emerge differently during various points of an economic/business cycle. for further discussion, see note 5 "allowance for credit losses, nonperforming assets, and concentrations of credit risk" to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data, included elsewhere in this report.

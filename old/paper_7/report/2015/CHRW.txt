overview our company. we are a global provider of transportation services and logistics solutions, operating through a network of offices in north america, europe, asia, and south america. as a third party logistics provider, we enter into contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies, and utilize those relationships to efficiently and cost effectively transport our customers' freight. we have contractual relationships with approximately 68,000 transportation companies, including motor carriers, railroads (primarily intermodal service providers), air freight, and ocean carriers. depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements, we select and hire the appropriate transportation for each shipment. our model enables us to be flexible, provide solutions that optimize service for our customers, and minimize our asset utilization risk.
in addition to transportation and logistics services, we also buy and sell fresh produce. our sourcing business is the buying, selling, and marketing of fresh produce. we purchase fresh produce through our network of produce suppliers and sell it to retail grocers, restaurant chains, produce wholesalers, and foodservice providers. in some cases, we also arrange the transportation of the produce we sell through our relationships with specialized transportation companies. those revenues are reported as transportation revenues.
our business model. we are primarily a service company. we add value and expertise in the procurement and execution of transportation and logistics, including sourcing of produce products for our customers. our total revenues represent the total dollar value of services and goods we sell to our customers. our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services, including contracted motor carrier, rail, ocean, air, and other costs, and the purchase price and services related to the products we source. our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source, add value, and sell services and products that are provided by third parties, and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement. accordingly, the discussion of our results of operations below focuses on the changes in our net revenues.
we keep our business model as variable as possible to allow us to be flexible and adapt to changing economic and industry conditions. we sell transportation services and produce to our customers with varied pricing arrangements. some prices are committed to for a period of time, subject to certain terms and conditions, and some prices are set on a spot market basis. we buy most of our truckload transportation capacity and produce on a spot market basis. because of this, our net revenue per transaction tends to increase in times when there is excess supply and decrease in times when demand is strong relative to supply.
in 2015, changing market conditions impacted our results. fuel prices declined throughout 2015, which contributed to slower growth of our total revenues and an increase in our transportation net revenue margins. in 2015, we completed the acquisition of freightquote.com, inc. ("freightquote"). this acquisition contributed approximately 6.5 percentage points to our consolidated net revenue growth in 2015, primarily in our ltl service line.
in 2014, market conditions were very different than in 2013. there were capacity constraints in nearly all of our transportation services. additionally, we experienced a decrease in the length of haul in our north american truckload business in 2014 compared to 2013, which contributed to increased net revenue margin in our truckload transportation business. in general, a shorter length of haul can result in higher customer rates and transportation costs per mile.
we keep our personnel and other operating expenses as variable as possible. compensation is performance-oriented and, for most employees in the office network, based on the profitability of their individual office.
25
our personnel decisions are decentralized. our office managers determine the appropriate number of employees for their offices, within productivity guidelines, based on their volume of business. this helps keep our personnel expense as variable as possible with the business.
our office network. our office network is a competitive advantage. building local customer and contract carrier relationships has been an important part of our success, and our worldwide network of offices supports our core strategy of serving customers locally, nationally, and globally. our network offices help us penetrate local markets, provide face-to-face service when needed, and recruit contract carriers. our network also gives us knowledge of local market conditions, which is important in the transportation industry because it is market driven and very dynamic.
in january 2015, we completed our acquisition of freightquote, a privately held freight broker based in kansas city, missouri. freightquote provides services throughout north america. the acquisition enhances and brings synergies to our ltl and truckload businesses, and expands our ecommerce capabilities.
our people. because we are a service company, our continued success is dependent on our ability to continue to hire and retain talented, productive people, and to properly align our headcount and personnel expense with our business. our headcount increased by 1,638 employees during 2015. approximately 60 percent of this increase is a result of our acquisition of freightquote. employees act as a team in their sales efforts, customer service, and operations. a significant portion of many of our employees' compensation is performance-oriented, based on individual performance and the profitability of their office. we believe this makes our employees more service-oriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity. all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating long-term ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders.
our customers. in 2015, we worked with more than 110,000 active customers. we work with a wide variety of companies, ranging in size from fortune 100 companies to small family businesses, in many different industries. our customer base is very diverse and unconcentrated. in 2015, our top 100 customers represented approximately 29 percent of our total revenues and approximately 25 percent of our net revenues. our largest customer was approximately two percent of our total revenues.
our contracted carriers. our contracted carrier base includes motor carriers, railroads (primarily intermodal service providers), air freight, and ocean carriers. in 2015, our carrier base was approximately 68,000, up from approximately 63,000 in 2014. motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 83 percent of our truckload shipments in 2015. in our transportation business, no single contracted carrier represents more than approximately two percent of our contracted carrier capacity.
2015 compared to 2014
total revenues and direct costs. total transportation revenues increased 0.4 percent to $12.0 billion in 2015 from $11.9 billion in 2014. this increase in transportation revenues was driven by our acquisition of freightquote and higher volumes in nearly all of our transportation modes. these increases were partially offset by decreased pricing to our customers primarily related to the declining cost of fuel. total purchased transportation and related services decreased 2.0 percent in 2015 to $9.8 billion from $10.0 billion in 2014. this decrease was due to decreased transportation costs, primarily related to the declining cost of fuel, partially offset by the acquisition of freightquote and higher volumes in nearly all of our transportation modes. our sourcing revenue decreased 3.1 percent to $1.49 billion in 2015 from $1.53 billion in 2014. purchased products sourced for resale decreased 3.7 percent in 2015 to $1.37 billion from $1.42 billion in 2014. these decreases were primarily due to decreased revenue and cost per case, partially offset by increased case volumes.
net revenues. total transportation net revenues increased 13.5 percent to $2.1 billion in 2015 from $1.9 billion in 2014. our transportation net revenue margin increased to 17.9 percent in 2015 from 15.9 percent in 2014. this increase in net revenue margin was driven by a decrease in transportation costs, including fuel, and a change in the mix of business due to growth in shorter length of haul freight and the addition of freightquote.
26
our truckload net revenues increased 10.6 percent to $1.3 billion in 2015 from $1.2 billion in 2014. truckload volumes increased approximately six percent in 2015. organic truckload net revenues increased approximately seven percent in 2015. our acquisition of freightquote contributed approximately 3.5 percentage points to our truckload net revenue growth in 2015. north american truckload volumes increased approximately six percent in 2015. north american truckload volumes, excluding freightquote, increased approximately three percent in 2015. truckload net revenue margin increased in 2015 due the declining cost of fuel. in our truckload business, the cost of fuel is generally a pass through to our customers. therefore, in periods of declining fuel prices, we tend to experience higher net revenue margin. excluding the estimated impact of the change in fuel, on average, our truckload rates increased approximately one percent in 2015. our truckload transportation costs were relatively unchanged, excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel.
ltl net revenues increased 39.3 percent to $360.7 million in 2015 from $258.9 million in 2014. freightquote contributed approximately 33 percentage points to our ltl net revenue growth in 2015. net revenue margin increased in 2015 as the result of a change in our freight mix with more small customers from the higher margin freightquote business. ltl volumes increased approximately 32 percent in 2015.
our intermodal net revenue increased 1.0 percent to $41.1 million in 2015 from $40.6 million in 2014. freightquote contributed approximately $3.4 million to our intermodal net revenues in 2015. conversion to truckload from intermodal negatively impacted intermodal volumes and net revenues throughout 2015. our intermodal net revenues declined throughout 2015 and that trend has continued into 2016.
our ocean transportation net revenues increased 7.3 percent to $223.6 million in 2015 from $208.4 million in 2014. the increase in net revenues was primarily due to increased net revenue margin and volumes.
our air transportation net revenues were unchanged at $79.1 million in 2015 from $79.1 million in 2014. this was the result of higher volumes offset by pricing declines.
our customs net revenues increased 5.7 percent to $43.9 million in 2015 from $41.6 million in 2014. the increase was due to increased transaction volumes.
other logistics services net revenues, which include managed services, warehousing, and small parcel, increased 12.9 percent to $82.5 million in 2015 from $73.1 million in 2014. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to growth in managed services as a result of adding new customers. freightquote contributed approximately two percentage points to our other logistics services net revenue growth in 2015.
sourcing net revenues increased 4.7 percent to $121.0 million in 2015 from $115.5 million in 2014. this increase was primarily due to an increase in case volumes, slightly offset by a decrease in net revenue per case. our net revenue margin increased to 8.1 percent in 2015 compared to 7.5 percent in 2014.
operating expenses. operating expenses increased 12.0 percent to $1.4 billion in 2015 from $1.3 billion in 2014. this was due to an increase of 12.0 percent in personnel expenses and an increase of 12.0 percent in other selling, general, and administrative expenses. as a percentage of net revenues, operating expenses decreased to 62.2 percent in 2015 from 62.7 percent in 2014.
our personnel expenses are driven by headcount and earnings growth. in 2015, personnel expenses increased to $1.1 billion from $0.9 billion in 2014. our personnel expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased in 2015 to 46.3 percent from 46.8 percent in 2014. the increase in personnel expense was due primarily to an increase in average headcount growth of approximately 14 percent in 2015. freightquote contributed approximately eight percentage points of the growth in average headcount during 2015. in addition, we experienced growth in expenses related to incentive plans that are designed to keep expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitability.
other selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 12.0 percent to $358.8 million in 2015 from $320.2 million in 2014. the increase in our selling, general, and administrative expenses is primarily due to our acquisition of freightquote, including amortization expense of $7.6 million, and an increase in travel expenses.
income from operations. income from operations increased 14.7 percent to $858.3 million in 2015 from $748.4 million in 2014. income from operations as a percentage of net revenues increased to 37.8 percent in 2015 from 37.3 percent in 2014. this increase was due to our net revenues growing more than our operating expenses.
27
interest and other expense. interest and other expense was $35.5 million in 2015 compared to $25.0 million in 2014. during the fourth quarter, we wrote off an indemnification asset of $7.2 million related to the acquisition of phoenix as the indemnification obligations of the sellers expired. the impact of this write off was partially offset within the provision for income taxes by related tax liabilities that expired under applicable statute of limitations. in addition, we had a higher average outstanding balance on our short-term borrowings throughout 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the acquisition of freightquote.
provision for income taxes. our effective income tax rate was 38.1 percent for 2015 and 37.8 percent for 2014. the effective income tax rate for both periods is greater than the statutory federal income tax rate, primarily due to state income taxes, net of federal benefit.
net income. net income increased 13.3 percent to $509.7 million in 2015 from $449.7 million in 2014. basic net income per share increased 15.0 percent to $3.52 from $3.06 in 2014. diluted net income per share increased 15.1 percent to $3.51 from $3.05 in 2014.
2014 compared to 2013
total revenues and direct costs. our consolidated total revenues increased 5.6 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. total transportation revenues increased 7.7 percent to $11.9 billion in 2014 from $11.1 billion in 2013. this increase in transportation revenues was driven by higher volumes in nearly all of our transportation modes and increased pricing to our customers. total purchased transportation and related services increased 7.2 percent in 2014 to $10.0 billion from $9.4 billion in 2013. this increase was due to higher volumes in nearly all of our transportation modes and higher transportation costs. our sourcing revenue decreased 8.1 percent to $1.5 billion in 2014 from $1.7 billion in 2013. purchased products sourced for resale decreased 8.1 percent in 2014 to $1.4 billion from $1.5 billion in 2013. these decreases were primarily due to decreased case volumes and a change in customer, product, and service mix.
net revenues. total transportation net revenues increased 10.7 percent to $1.9 billion in 2014 from $1.7 billion in 2013. our transportation net revenue margin increased to 15.9 percent in 2014 from 15.4 percent in 2013, largely driven by an increase in transportation rates charged to our customers, partially offset by higher transportation costs.
our truckload net revenues increased 11.7 percent to $1.2 billion in 2014 from $1.1 billion in 2013. truckload volumes increased approximately 3 percent in 2014. truckload net revenue margin increased in 2014 due to increased rates charged to our customers, partially offset by increased cost of capacity. excluding the estimated impact of the change in fuel, on average, our truckload rates increased approximately 11 percent in 2014. our truckload transportation costs increased approximately 10 percent, excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel.
ltl net revenues increased 8.1 percent to $258.9 million in 2014 from $239.5 million in 2013. the increase in net revenues was driven by an increase in total shipments of approximately seven percent and increased customer pricing, partially offset by decreased net revenue margin.
our intermodal net revenue increase of 4.0 percent to $40.6 million in 2014 from $39.1 million in 2013 was driven largely by a change in the mix of business and improved customer pricing, partially offset by volume declines.
our ocean transportation net revenues increased 11.1 percent to $208.4 million in 2014 from $187.7 million in 2013. the increase in net revenues was primarily due to increased volumes and net revenue margin.
our air transportation net revenues increased 8.3 percent to $79.1 million in 2014 from $73.1 million in 2013. the increase was primarily due to increased net revenue margin and volumes.
our customs net revenues increased 13.7 percent to $41.6 million in 2014 from $36.6 million in 2013. the increase was due to increased transaction volumes.
other logistics services net revenues, which include managed services, warehousing, and small parcel, increased 7.6 percent to $73.1 million in 2014 from $67.9 million in 2013. the increase in 2014 was primarily due to growth in managed services as a result of adding new customers.

liquidity and capital resources we have historically generated substantial cash from operations, which has enabled us to fund our growth while paying cash dividends and repurchasing stock. in december 2014, we amended our revolving credit facility to increase the amount available from $500 million to $900 million, to extend the expiration date from october 2017 to december 2019, and to revise a covenant ratio. in 2013, we entered into a note purchase agreement to fund the accelerated share repurchase agreements to repurchase $500 million worth of our common stock. the note purchase agreement was amended in february 2015 to conform its financial covenants to be consistent with the amended revolving credit facility. we also expect to use the revolving credit facility, and potentially other indebtedness incurred in the future, to assist us in continuing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, possible acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases. cash and cash equivalents totaled $168.2 million and $128.9 million as of december 31, 2015 and 2014. cash and cash equivalents held outside the united states totaled $114.3 million and $80.6 million  as of december 31, 2015 and 2014. working capital at december 31, 2015, was $282.1 million. working capital at december 31, 2014, was $529.6 million.
we prioritize our investments to grow the business, as we require some working capital and a relatively small amount of capital expenditures to grow. we are continually looking for acquisitions, but those acquisitions must fit our culture and enhance our growth opportunities.
cash flow from operating activities. we generated $718.3 million, $513.4 million, and $347.8 million of cash flow from operations in 2015, 2014, and 2013. the increase of $204.9 million in cash flow from operations in 2015 is primarily the result of a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in net income, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable. the decreases in accounts receivable and accounts payable are primarily the result of declining fuel prices.
cash used for investing activities. we used $54.4 million of cash in 2015, $388.9 million of cash in 2014, and $28.9 million of cash in 2013 for investing activities. our investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures and cash paid for acquisitions. on december 31, 2014, we funded $359.4 million of the purchase price for the acquisition of freightquote into escrow accounts pursuant to the purchase agreement and for completion of the acquisition in january 2015.

we used $44.6 million, $29.5 million, and $48.2 million of cash for capital expenditures in 2015, 2014, and 2013. we spent $26.0 million, $24.0 million,and $35.9 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013 primarily for annual investments in information technology equipment to support our operating systems, including the purchase and development of software. these information technology investments are intended to improve efficiencies and help grow the business. additionally, in 2014, we completed a new office building on our corporate campus in eden prairie, minnesota. this building was completed in the first quarter of 2014 and it replaced space we previously leased in eden prairie. the cost of the building was approximately $18.5 million, and the majority was funded in 2013.
we anticipate capital expenditures in 2016 to be approximately $70 million to $80 million. the increase is primarily the result of the planned construction of an additional data center, which is expected to be completed in 2016.
cash used for financing activities. we used $607.7 million, $143.6 million, and $364.9 million of cash flow for financing activities in 2015, 2014, and 2013.
we had net short-term repayments of $155.0 million in 2015 and net short-term borrowings of $230.0 million in 2014. on october 29, 2012, we entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility for up to $500 million with a $500 million accordion feature. in december of 2014, we amended this facility to increase the amount available from $500 million to $900 million, extended the expiration of the facility from october 2017 to december 2019, and revise a covenant ratio. this facility had $450.0 million outstanding as of december 31, 2015. the original purpose of this facility was to partially fund the acquisition of phoenix and will assist us in continuing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, possible acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases. advances under the facility carry an interest rate based on our total funded debt to total capitalization, as measured at the end of each quarter, and are based on a spread over libor for outstanding balances. in addition, there is a commitment fee on the average daily undrawn stated amount under each letter of credit issued under the facility. the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum fixed leverage ratio and minimum liquidity. we were in compliance with all of the credit facility's debt covenants as of december 31, 2015.
on august 23, 2013, we entered into a note purchase agreement for $500.0 million, of which the entire balance was outstanding as of december 31, 2015, and december 31, 2014. the primary purpose of this agreement was to fund the asr agreements that were entered into on august 24, 2013. the agreement contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum leverage ratio, an interest coverage ratio, and minimum liquidity. we were in compliance with all the covenants in the notes as of december 31, 2015. the note purchase agreement was amended in february 2015 to conform its financial covenants to be consistent with the amended revolving credit facility.
we used $235.6 million, $215.0 million, and $220.3 million to pay cash dividends in 2015, 2014, and 2013. the increase in 2015 was primarily the result of higher dividends paid compared to 2014. the decrease in 2014 was due to a decrease in the number of shares outstanding compared to 2013, primarily as a result of the accelerated share repurchases made in 2013.
we also used $229.9 million, $164.0 million, and $757.3 million on share repurchases in 2015, 2014, and 2013. in august 2013, the board of directors increased the number of shares authorized to be repurchased by 15,000,000 shares. as of december 31, 2015, there were 6,885,661 shares remaining for future repurchases. the number of shares we repurchase, if any, during future periods will vary based on our cash position, potential uses of our cash, and market conditions.
assuming no change in our current business plan, management believes that our available cash, together with expected future cash generated from operations, the amount available under our credit facility, and credit available in the market, will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital, capital expenditures, and cash dividends in future periods. we also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit or other forms of indebtedness on short notice, if needed.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all majority-owned subsidiaries. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions. in certain circumstances, those estimates and assumptions can affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes. in preparing our financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below. however, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. the following is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates.

revenue recognition. total revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by customers. net revenues are total revenues less the direct costs of transportation, products, and handling. we act principally as the service provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are delivered. at that time, our obligations to the transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured. most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell. in these transactions, we are the primary obligor, we have credit risk, we have discretion to select the supplier, and we have latitude in pricing decisions.
additionally, in our sourcing business, we take loss of inventory risk during shipment and have general inventory risk. certain transactions in customs brokerage, managed services, freight forwarding, and sourcing are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not present.
valuations for accounts receivable. our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based upon the aging of our receivables, our historical experience of uncollectible accounts, and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified. the allowance of $43.5 million as of december 31, 2015, increased compared to the allowance of $41.1 million as of december 31, 2014. this increase was primarily due to changes in the risk level of our accounts receivable portfolio. we believe that the recorded allowance is sufficient and appropriate based on our customer aging trends, the exposures we have identified, and our historical loss experience.
goodwill. we manage and report our operations as one operating segment. our network of offices represent a series of components that are aggregated for the purpose of evaluating goodwill for impairment on an enterprise-wide basis. the fair value of the enterprise-wide reporting unit substantially exceeds the book value; therefore we have determined that there is no goodwill impairment as of december 31, 2015.
stock-based compensation. we issue stock awards, including stock options, performance shares, and restricted stock units, to key employees and outside directors. in general, the awards vest over five years, either based on the company's earnings growth or the passage of time. the fair value of each share-based payment award is established on the date of grant. for grants of restricted shares and restricted units, the fair value is established based on the market price on the date of the grant, discounted for post-vesting holding restrictions. the discounts on outstanding grants vary from 17 percent to 22 percent and are calculated using the black-scholes option pricing model. changes in the measured stock price volatility and interest rates are the primary reason for changes in the discount. for grants of options, we use the black-scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the awards. the determination of the fair value is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends.

(1)   amounts payable relate to the semi-annual interest due on the long-term notes and the principal amount at maturity.
(2)   we have certain facilities and equipment under operating leases.
(3)   purchase obligations include agreements for services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. as of december 31, 2015, such obligations include ocean and air freight capacity, telecommunications services, and maintenance contracts.

we have no capital lease obligations. long-term liabilities consist of noncurrent income taxes payable, long-term notes payable, and the obligation under our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31, 2015, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. therefore, $19.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes. the obligation under our non-qualified deferred compensation plan has also been excluded from the above table as the timing of cash payment is uncertain. as of december 31, 2015, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of sec regulation s-k.

item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.

overview genuine parts company is a service organization engaged in the distribution of automotive parts, industrial parts, office products and electrical/electronic materials. we have a long tradition of growth dating back to 1928, the year we were founded in atlanta, georgia. the company conducted business in 2015 throughout the united states, canada, australia, new zealand, mexico and puerto rico from approximately 2,650 locations.
we recorded consolidated net sales of $15.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015, down 0.4% compared to sales in 2014. consolidated net income for the year ended december 31, 2015 was $706 million, down 1% from $711 million in 2014. our revenue and earnings in 2015 reflect a 3% negative impact of currency translation and after adjusting for this factor, the company produced an increase in both sales and net income. the companys internal growth initiatives, including the positive impact of acquisitions, as well as effective cost management, which we discuss further below, served to support our underlying progress for the year.
the relatively unchanged sales results for 2015 compare to a 9% sales increase in 2014 and an 8% sales increase in 2013. net income in 2014 increased by 4% and was up 6% in 2013. in 2014, improved market conditions relative to the prior year drove sales and earnings growth in each of our four business segments. in 2013, we experienced difficult market conditions in the industrial, electrical/electronic and office industries, while the automotive business performed reasonably well. over the three year period of 2013 through 2015, our financial performance was positively impacted by a variety of initiatives the company implemented to grow sales and earnings across our businesses. examples of such initiatives include strategic acquisitions, the introduction of
18
new and expanded product lines, geographic expansion, sales to new markets, enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives. we discuss these initiatives further below.
with regard to the december 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet, the companys cash balance of $212 million compares to cash of $138 million at december 31, 2014. the company continues to maintain a strong cash position, supported by relatively steady net income and effective asset management in 2015. accounts receivable decreased by approximately 3%, which compares to an approximate 4% sales decrease in the fourth quarter of the year, and inventory was down by approximately 1%. accounts payable increased $267 million or 10% from the prior year, due primarily to improved payment terms with certain suppliers. total debt outstanding at december 31, 2015 was $625 million, down from total debt of $765 at december 31, 2014.
results of operations our results of operations are summarized below for the three years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

net sales consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31, 2015 totaled $15.3 billion, down slightly from 2014. 2015 net sales included a 1.5% increase in sales volume and a 1% contribution from acquisitions, offset by an approximate 3% negative impact of currency. the impact of product inflation varied by business in 2015 and, cumulatively, prices were down 0.2% in the automotive segment, up approximately 0.9% in the industrial segment, up approximately 0.6% in the office segment and down approximately 1.7% in the electrical/electronic segment. the company is well positioned with strategic plans in place to grow sales in 2016.
consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31, 2014 totaled $15.3 billion, a 9% increase from 2013 and driven by revenue growth in each of our four business segments. the increase in sales volume and acquisitions across our four businesses each contributed 5% to our total sales growth, while currency negatively impacted total sales by 1%. the impact of product inflation varied by business in 2014 and, cumulatively, prices were flat in the automotive segment, up approximately 1.5% in the industrial segment, up approximately 1.4% in the office segment and up approximately 0.3% in the electrical/electronic segment.
automotive group net sales for the automotive group (automotive) were $8.0 billion in 2015, a 1% decrease from 2014. the decrease in sales for the year consists of a positive core sales increase of approximately 3.5% and a slight benefit from acquisitions. combined, the approximate 4% growth was offset by a 5% negative impact of currency associated with our automotive businesses in canada, australasia and mexico. automotive sales were not materially impacted by product inflation. in 2015, automotive revenues were flat in the first and second quarters and down 2% in the third and fourth quarters. we believe that the underlying fundamentals in the automotive aftermarket, including the overall number and age of the vehicle population as well as the positive increase in miles driven, remain solid and will serve to drive sustained demand for automotive aftermarket maintenance and supply items in 2016. despite the expectation for continued headwinds associated with the strong u.s. dollar and related impact of currency, we expect these fundamentals and the internal growth initiatives in our automotive business to drive sales growth for this group in 2016.
net sales for automotive were $8.1 billion in 2014, an increase of 8% from 2013. the increase in sales for the year consists of a positive comparable store sales increase of approximately 6% and approximately 4% from
19
acquisitions. these increases were offset by a 2% negative impact of currency associated with our automotive businesses in canada, australasia and mexico. automotive sales were not materially impacted by product inflation. in 2014, automotive revenues were up 23% in the first quarter, up 5% in the second quarter and up 4% in the third and fourth quarters. the first quarter sales increase includes the impact of the gpc asia pacific acquisition, which was anniversaried on april 1, 2014.
industrial group net sales for motion industries, our industrial group (industrial), were $4.6 billion in 2015, a 3% decrease from 2014. sales volumes in industrial were down approximately 4% from the prior year, while a 1% negative impact of currency associated with our canadian and mexican operations also contributed to the decline in sales. these items were partially offset by higher transaction values associated with product inflation, which added an approximate 1% to sales, and 1% in sales from acquisitions. industrial revenues were up 3% in the first quarter of 2015, down 2% in the second quarter, down 4% in the third quarter and down 7.5% in the fourth quarter. the manufacturing indices we track in this group progressively weakened throughout 2015, which correlates to lower demand among our customer base and, in particular, those customers dependent on exports as well as the oil and gas sector. we expect the tough industrial economy to persist well into 2016, although we do have multiple initiatives in place to help us grow our market share and overcome these challenges.
net sales for industrial were $4.8 billion in 2014, an increase of 8% from 2013. sales volumes in industrial were up approximately 4.5% from the prior year, while higher transaction values associated with product inflation added 1.5% and acquisitions contributed approximately 3% to sales in 2014. these items were offset by a 1% negative impact of currency associated with our canadian business. industrial revenues were up 4% in the first quarter of 2014, up 7% in the second quarter and up 10% in the third and fourth quarters.
office group net sales for s. p. richards, our office products group (office), were $1.9 billion in 2015, an increase of 7.5% from 2014. the increase in sales reflects an approximate 4% increase in sales volume, a 0.6% increase in higher transaction values associated with price inflation and a 3% contribution from acquisitions. these items were offset by an approximate 0.5% negative impact of currency associated with our canadian operations. in 2015, office experienced relatively stable industry conditions, as evidenced by the steady growth in new jobs throughout the year. these conditions combined with new business from a primary customer, which anniversaried on july 1, 2015, served to drive the increase in sales volume for the year. sales were up 17% in the first quarter, up 14% in the second quarter, up 3% in the third quarter and down 2% in the fourth quarter of 2015. we will continue to focus on our growth initiatives, including the ongoing diversification of product and customer portfolios, market share gains and acquisitions to further improve the office business in 2016.
net sales for office were $1.8 billion in 2014, an increase of 10% from 2013. the increase in sales reflects a 4% increase in sales volume, a 1.4% increase in higher transaction values associated with price inflation and a 5% contribution from acquisitions. these items were offset by the slight negative impact of currency associated with our canadian operations. in 2014, office experienced improving industry conditions, as evidenced by consistently stronger new jobs reports relative to 2013 as well as a strengthening u.s. gdp. these conditions combined with new business with a primary customer, effective july 1, 2014, served to drive the increased sales volume for the year. sales were unchanged in the first quarter, up 4% in the second quarter, up 15% in the third quarter and up 22% in the fourth quarter of 2014.
electrical/electronic group net sales for eis, our electrical and electronic group (electrical/electronic), were $751 million in 2015, an increase of 1.5% from 2014. the increase in sales consists of a 5% contribution from acquisitions, offset by a 1.7% headwind from lower transaction values associated with price deflation, a 1% negative sales impact of copper pricing and a 1% decrease in sales volume. sales for electrical/electronic increased by 1% in the first quarter, 4% in the second quarter, 2% in the third quarter and were unchanged in the fourth quarter, relative to
20
the prior year periods. as this business is dependent on the manufacturing segment of the economy, we expect to face challenging end market conditions for at least the first half of 2016. to offset the challenges, we have initiatives in place to generate growth for this business.
net sales for electrical/electronic were $739 million in 2014, an increase of 30% from 2013. the increase in sales consists of an increase in sales volume of approximately 1% and a 29% sales contribution from acquisitions. the benefit of higher transaction values associated with slight price inflation for the year was offset by the negative sales impact of copper pricing. sales for electrical/electronic increased by 30% in the first quarter, 32% in the second quarter, 35% in the third quarter and 23% in the fourth quarter.
cost of goods sold the company includes in cost of goods sold the actual cost of merchandise, which represents the vast majority of this line item. other items in cost of goods sold include warranty costs and in-bound freight from the supplier, net of any vendor allowances and incentives. cost of goods sold was $10.72 billion in 2015, $10.75 billion in 2014 and $9.86 billion in 2013. cost of goods sold in 2015 and 2014 changed from the prior year periods in accordance with the related percentage change in sales for the same periods. for these periods, product inflation was relatively insignificant and actual costs were relatively unchanged from the prior year. cost of goods sold represented 70.2% of net sales in 2015, 70.1% of net sales in 2014 and 70.0% of net sales in 2013 and, as a percent of net sales, increased slightly in 2015 from 2014 and also in 2014 from 2013.
in 2015, 2014 and 2013, the industrial and office business segments experienced slight vendor price increases. in 2014 and 2013, the electrical/electronic business also experienced slight vendor price increases. in any year where we experience price increases, we are able to work with our customers to pass most of these along to them.
operating expenses the company includes in selling, administrative and other expenses (sg&a), all personnel and personnel-related costs at its headquarters, distribution centers, stores and branches, which accounts for approximately 65% of total sg&a. additional costs in sg&a include our facilities, delivery, marketing, advertising, legal and professional costs.
sg&a of $3.28 billion in 2015 decreased by $37 million or approximately 1% from 2014. this represents 21.4% of net sales, and compares favorably to 21.6% of net sales in 2014. the decrease in sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales from the prior year reflect the positive impact of our cost control measures and our management teams focus on properly managing the companys expenses. we also continue to assess the optimal cost structure in our businesses. depreciation and amortization expense was $142 million in 2015, a decrease of approximately $6 million or 4% from 2014. the provision for doubtful accounts was $12 million in 2015, up from $7 million in 2014. we believe the company is adequately reserved for bad debts at december 31, 2015.
sg&a increased by $286 million or approximately 9% to $3.31 billion in 2014, representing 21.6% of net sales, which compares to 21.5% of net sales in 2013. the increase in sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales from the prior year primarily reflects the $54 million one-time gain, net of other expense adjustments, recorded to sg&a in the second quarter of 2013 as a purchase accounting adjustment associated with the april 1, 2013 acquisition of gpc asia pacific. our management teams remain focused on properly managing the companys expenses and continuing to assess the appropriate cost structure in our businesses. depreciation and amortization expense was $148 million in 2014, an increase of $14 million or 11% from 2013. this increase relates to higher depreciation and the amortization associated with acquisitions in both 2014 and 2013. the provision for doubtful accounts was $7 million in 2014, down from $9 million in 2013.
total share-based compensation expense for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $17.7 million, $16.2 million and $12.6 million, respectively. refer to note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding share-based compensation.
21
non-operating expenses and income non-operating expenses consist primarily of interest. interest expense was $22 million in 2015, $25 million in 2014 and $27 million in 2013. the $3 million decrease in interest expense in 2015 reflects the impact of lower outstanding debt levels during the year relative to 2014. the $2 million decrease in interest expense in 2014 reflects the favorable interest rate on certain debt, which was renewed in november 2013.
in other, the net benefit of interest income, equity method investment income, investment dividends and noncontrolling interests in 2015 was $21 million, a $2 million increase from the prior year due to higher interest income earned in 2015 relative to 2014. these items were $19 million in 2014, down from $22 million in 2013. the decrease of $3 million from the prior year was due to lower interest income earned in 2014 relative to 2013.
income before income taxes income before income taxes was $1.1 billion in 2015, a slight increase from 2014. as a percentage of net sales, income before income taxes was 7.4% in 2015 compared to 7.3% in 2014. in 2014, income before income taxes of $1.1 billion was up 7% from 2013 and as a percentage of net sales was 7.3% compared to 7.4% in 2013.
automotive group automotive income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales, which we refer to as operating margin, increased to 9.1% in 2015 from 8.7% in 2014. this groups initiatives to improve its gross margin and effectively manage its costs positively impacted automotives operating profit during the year. looking forward, planned initiatives to grow sales and control costs are intended to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead.
automotives operating margin of 8.7% in 2014 was up slightly from 8.6% in 2013. the change in operating costs as a percentage of net sales positively impacted operating profit during the year.
industrial group industrials operating margin decreased to 7.3% in 2015 from 7.8% in 2014, as the decline in sales for the year resulted in lower volume incentives, which pressured gross margins, and reduced expense leverage relative to 2014. the challenging market conditions for this business are expected to persist well into 2016. however, industrial has multiple initiatives in place to help us overcome these challenges.
industrials operating margin improved to 7.8% in 2014 from 7.2% in 2013, as the combination of greater expense leverage associated with the increase in sales and generally improving gross margins, primarily related to the increase in volume incentives, positively impacted operating profit in 2014.
office group offices operating margin decreased slightly to 7.3% in 2015 from 7.4% in 2014, primarily related to the deleveraging of expenses due to slower sales growth in the last half of the year. office will continue to focus on its sales initiatives and cost control measures in 2016.
offices operating margin decreased to 7.4% in 2014, down from 7.5% in 2013, primarily related to the lower operating margin generated by new business with a large primary customer. this was partially offset by greater expense leverage driven by this groups overall sales increase in 2014.
electrical/electronic group electrical/electronics operating margin increased to 9.3% in 2015 from 8.8% in 2014, as higher margin acquisitions, declining copper prices and effective cost management positively impacted the operating margins for this group. electrical/electronic will continue to focus on its sales initiatives and cost controls to further improve its operating margin in 2016.
electrical/electronics operating margin increased to 8.8% in 2014 from 8.4% in 2013, primarily due to greater expense leverage associated with this groups sales increase in 2014.
22
income taxes the effective income tax rate of 37.2% in 2015 increased from 36.4% in 2014. the increase in rate primarily reflects the companys higher mix of u.s. earnings in 2015, which is taxed at a higher rate relative to our foreign operations. to a lesser extent, the less favorable retirement asset valuation adjustment in 2015 relative to 2014 impacted the increase in rate.
the income tax rate of 36.4% in 2014 increased from 34.4% in 2013. the increase in rate is primarily due to the favorable tax rate applied to the one-time gain associated with the gpc asia pacific acquisition recorded in 2013. additionally, the companys retirement asset valuation adjustment was less favorable in 2014 relative to 2013. the higher mix of u.s. earnings, taxed at a higher rate relative to our foreign operations, also contributed to the increase in the 2014 tax rate.
net income net income was $706 million in 2015, a decrease of 1% from $711 million in 2014. on a per share diluted basis, net income was $4.63 in 2015, up slightly compared to $4.61 in 2014. net income was 4.6% of net sales in 2015 and 2014.
net income was $711 million in 2014, an increase of 4% from $685 million in 2013. on a per share diluted basis, net income was $4.61 in 2014 compared to $4.40 in 2013, up 5%. net income in 2014 was 4.6% of net sales compared to 4.9% of net sales in 2013.
in connection with the acquisition of gpc asia pacific, the company recorded one-time positive purchase accounting adjustments of $33 million or $0.21 per diluted share in 2013. before the impact of these adjustments, net income in 2014 was up 9% from 2013, and on a per share diluted basis, net income was up 10% from 2013.
financial condition our cash balance of $212 million at december 31, 2015 compares to our cash balance of $138 million at december 31, 2014, as discussed further below. the companys accounts receivable balance at december 31, 2015 decreased by approximately 3% from the prior year. this compares to the companys 4% sales decrease for the fourth quarter of 2015, and we are satisfied with the quality and collectability of our accounts receivable. inventory at december 31, 2015 decreased by approximately 1% from december 31, 2014 and accounts payable increased $267 million or approximately 10% from december 31, 2014 due primarily to improved payment terms with certain suppliers.
liquidity and capital resources the companys sources of capital consist primarily of cash flows from operations, supplemented as necessary by private issuances of debt and bank borrowings. we have $625 million of total debt outstanding at december 31, 2015, of which $250 million matures in november 2016 and $250 million matures in december 2023. in addition, the company has an unsecured revolving line of credit with a consortium of financial institutions for $1.2 billion, of which approximately $125 million and $265 million were outstanding under the line of credit at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. currently, we believe that our cash on hand and available short-term and long-term sources of capital are sufficient to fund the companys operations, including working capital requirements, scheduled debt payments, interest payments, capital expenditures, benefit plan contributions, income tax obligations, dividends, share repurchases and contemplated acquisitions.
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.4 to 1 at december 31, 2015 and 1.6 to 1 at december 31, 2014. our liquidity position remains solid. the companys total debt outstanding at december 31, 2015 is down $140 million or 18% from december 31, 2014.

net cash provided by operating activities:
the company continues to generate cash and in 2015 net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.2 billion. this reflects a 47% increase from 2014, as the collective change in trade accounts receivable, merchandise inventories and trade accounts payable represented a $312 million source of cash in 2015 compared to a $34 million use of cash in 2014. net cash provided by operating activities was $790 million in 2014, a 25% decrease from 2013 due primarily to the change in trade accounts receivable, merchandise inventories and trade accounts payable, which, collectively, net to a $34 million use of cash in 2014 compared to a $278 million source of cash in 2013. this decline was partially offset by the increase in net income and depreciation and amortization of $26 million and $14 million, respectively, in 2014.
net cash used in investing activities:
net cash flow used in investing activities was $264 million in 2015 compared to $387 million in 2014, a decrease of 32%. cash used for acquisitions of businesses and other investing activities in 2015 was $163 million, or $125 million less than in 2014. capital expenditures of $110 million in 2015 were relatively unchanged from 2014, and were slightly lower than our original estimate of $125 to $145 million for the year. we estimate that cash used for capital expenditures in 2016 will be approximately $140 to $160 million. net cash flow used in investing activities was $387 million in 2014 compared to $826 million in 2013, a decrease of 53%. cash used for acquisitions of businesses and other investing activities in 2014 was $288 million, or $424 million less than in 2013. capital expenditures of $108 million in 2014 decreased by $16 million or 13% from 2013, and were slightly lower than our estimate of $120 to $130 million for the year.
net cash used in financing activities:
the company used $806 million of cash in financing activities in 2015, up 77% from the $455 million used in financing activities in 2014. cash used in financing activities in 2014 was up $30 million or 7% from the $425 million used in 2013. for the three years presented, net cash used in financing activities was primarily for dividends paid to shareholders and repurchases of the companys common stock. the company paid dividends to shareholders of $368 million, $347 million and $326 million during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the company expects this trend of increasing dividends to continue in the foreseeable future. during 2015, 2014 and 2013, the company repurchased $292 million, $96 million and $121 million, respectively, of the companys common stock. we expect to remain active in our share repurchase program, but the amount and value of shares repurchased will vary. in 2015, net cash used in financing activities also included payments on debt of approximately $140 million net of debt proceeds.
notes and other borrowings the company maintains a $1.2 billion unsecured revolving line of credit with a consortium of financial institutions, which matures in june 2020 with two optional one year extensions and bears interest at libor plus a margin, which is based on the companys leverage ratio (1.17% at december 31, 2015). the company also has the option under this agreement to increase its borrowing an additional $350 million, as well as an option to decrease the borrowing capacity or terminate the facility with appropriate notice. at december 31, 2015 and
24
2014, approximately $125 million and $265 million were outstanding under this line of credit, respectively. due to the workers compensation and insurance reserve requirements in certain states, the company also had unused letters of credit of approximately $63 million outstanding at december 31, 2015 and 2014.
at december 31, 2015, the company had unsecured senior notes outstanding under financing arrangement as follows: $250 million series d and e senior unsecured notes, 3.35% fixed, due 2016; and $250 million series f senior unsecured notes, 2.99% fixed, due 2023. these borrowings contain covenants related to a maximum debt-to-capitalization ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings. at december 31, 2015, the company was in compliance with all such covenants. the weighted average interest rate on the companys total outstanding borrowings was approximately 2.76% at december 31, 2015 and 2.46% at december 31, 2014. total interest expense, net of interest income, for all borrowings was $20.4 million, $24.2 million and $24.3 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
contractual and other obligations the following table shows the companys approximate obligations and commitments, including interest due on credit facilities, to make future payments under specified contractual obligations as of december 31, 2015:
contractual obligations payment due by period total                     less than                     1-3 years                3-5 years           over

due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with the companys unrecognized tax benefits at december 31, 2015, the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. therefore, $18 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. refer to note 6 of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes.
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates. we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. the company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements.

the company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores (independents) and certain other affiliates in which the company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest (affiliates). the companys maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to the companys guarantee. to date, the company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents and affiliates borrowings. the following table shows the companys approximate commercial commitments as of december 31, 2015:
other commercial commitments amount of commitment expiration per period total                  less than                    1-3 years                    3-5 years                   over amounts                1 year                                                                                5 years committed

in addition, the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time. contributions in 2015 were $55 million. we expect to make $49 million in cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit plans in 2016, and contributions required for 2016 and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans obligations.
share repurchases in 2015, the company repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares and the company had remaining authority to purchase approximately 6.3 million shares at december 31, 2015.
critical accounting policies general managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates, assumptions and judgments. an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. for further information on the critical accounting policies, see note 1 of the consolidated financial statements.
inventories  provisions for slow moving and obsolescence the company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate provisions related thereto. historically, these losses have not been significant as the vast majority of the companys inventories are
26
not highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs. while the company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future, its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur.
allowance for doubtful accounts  methodology the company evaluates the collectability of trade accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience and periodically adjusts this estimate when the company becomes aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filing) or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable. while the company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed, a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and, therefore, the need to revise estimates for bad debts. for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of approximately $12.4 million, $7.2 million, and $8.7 million, respectively.
consideration received from vendors the company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives. generally, the company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria. the company accrues for the receipt of these incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year. while management believes the company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in 2016 and beyond, there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future or that we will be able to achieve the specified volumes necessary to take advantage of such incentives.
impairment of property, plant and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets at least annually, the company evaluates property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators. the companys judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance, among other factors. future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired. evaluating for impairment also requires the company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which require judgment by management. any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and results of operations.
employee benefit plans the companys benefit plan committees in the u.s. and canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the companys pension plan assets. the pension plan investment strategy implemented by the companys management is to achieve long-term objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the u.s. and canada, as well as fiduciary standards. the long-term primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital without undue exposure to risk, protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plans actuarially assumed long term rates of return. the companys investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark (49% s&p 500 index, 5% russell mid cap index, 8% russell 2000 index, 5% msci eafe index, 5% dj global moderate index and 28% barcap u.s. govt/credit).
we make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan assets and liabilities and related pension expense. we believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases, mortality rates, retirement patterns and turnover rates. refer to note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these assumptions.
27
based on the investment policy for the pension plans, as well as an asset study that was performed based on the companys asset allocations and future expectations, the companys expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2016 pension expense or income is 7.83% for the plans. the asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the companys benefit obligations, using capital market data and historical relationships.
the discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date. we have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of high-quality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate. based upon this cash flow matching analysis, we selected a weighted average discount rate for the plans of 4.82% at december 31, 2015.
net periodic benefit (income) cost for our defined benefit pension plans was ($5.8) million, ($9.6) million and $51.1 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the income associated with the pension plans in 2015 and 2014 reflects the impact of the hard freeze effective december 31, 2013. refer to note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans.

we recorded the quarterly earnings per share amounts as if each quarter was a discrete period. as a result, the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per share will not necessarily total the annual basic and diluted earnings per share.
the preparation of interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. specifically, the company makes estimates and assumptions in its interim condensed consolidated financial statements for inventory adjustments, the accrual of bad debts, customer sales returns and volume incentives earned, among others. inventory adjustments (including adjustments for a majority of inventories that are valued under the last-in, first-out (lifo) method) are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual book to physical inventory adjustment and lifo valuation, which is performed each year-end. reserves for bad debts and customer sales returns are estimated and accrued on an interim basis based upon historical experience. volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing levels. the estimates and assumptions for interim reporting may change upon final determination at year-end, and such changes may be significant. the effect of these adjustments in 2015 and 2014 was not significant.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is intended to provide a summary of significant factors relevant to our financial performance and condition. the discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data. results for the fiscal year ended may 31, 2015 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be attained in the future.
executive overview conagra foods, inc. (nyse: cag) is one of north america's largest packaged food companies with branded and private branded food found in 99% of america's households, as well as a strong commercial foods business serving restaurants and foodservice operations globally. consumers can find recognized brands such as banquet®, chef boyardee®, egg beaters®, healthy choice®, hebrew national®, hunt's®, marie callender's®, orville redenbacher's®, pam®, peter pan®, reddi-wip®, slim jim®, snack pack®, and many other conagra foods brands, along with food sold by conagra foods under private brand labels, in grocery, convenience, mass merchandise, club, and drug stores. additionally, conagra foods supplies frozen and sweet potato products as well as other vegetable, spice, bakery, and grain products to commercial and foodservice customers.
management's primary objective for fiscal 2015 was stabilization and recovery. fiscal 2015 performance reflected increased volumes in the consumer foods and commercial foods segments, primarily due to the extra week in the fiscal year. private brands performance continued to reflect weak volumes and margin pressures resulting from an intense bidding environment and executional challenges. we generated operating cash flows of approximately $1.47 billion from continuing operations and repaid $1.1 billion of debt during fiscal 2015.
subsequent to fiscal 2015, on june 30, 2015, we announced our plan to exit the private brands operations. our plans for creating long-term value will center on a more aggressive approach to driving margin improvement through selling, general and administrative expense reductions, supply chain efficiencies, and other projects. it also focuses on growing our consumer foods and commercial foods segments, as well as balanced capital allocation.
diluted loss per share in fiscal 2015 was $0.60, including a loss of $1.46 per diluted share from continuing operations and earnings of $0.86 per diluted share from discontinued operations. diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2014 were $0.70, including $0.37 per diluted share from continuing operations and $0.33 per diluted share from discontinued operations. several significant items affect the comparability of year-over-year results of continuing operations (see "items impacting comparability" below).

acquisitions on may 12, 2015, we acquired blake's all natural foods, a family-owned company specializing in all natural and organic frozen meals, including pot pies, casseroles, pasta dishes, and other entrees, for $20.7 million in cash, net of cash acquired. the purchase included property and equipment associated with making frozen meals. this business is included in the consumer foods segment.
in july 2014, we acquired taimei potato industry limited, a chinese potato processor, for $92.2 million, consisting of $74.9 million in cash, net of cash acquired, plus assumed liabilities. the purchase included property and equipment associated with making frozen potato products. this business is included in the commercial foods segment.
18
in september 2013, we acquired frozen dessert production assets from harlan bakeries for $39.9 million in cash. the purchase included machinery, operating systems, warehousing/storage, and other assets associated with making frozen fruit pies, cream pies, pastry shells, and loaf cakes. this business is included in the consumer foods segment.
discontinued operations in april 2014, we completed the sale of a small snack business, medallion foods, for $32.0 million in cash. the business results were previously reflected in the private brands segment. we reflected the results of these operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
in september 2013, we completed the sale of the assets of the lightlife® business for $54.7 million in cash. the business results were previously reflected in the consumer foods segment. we reflected the results of these operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
formation of ardent mills on may 29, 2014, the company, cargill, incorporated, and chs, inc. completed the formation of ardent mills. in connection with the formation, we contributed all of the assets of conagra mills, including $49.0 million of cash, to ardent mills, we received a 44% ownership interest in ardent mills, and ardent mills distributed $391.4 million in cash to us as a return of capital. the contribution of the assets of conagra mills in exchange for a non-controlling interest in the newly formed joint venture is required to be accounted for at fair value, and, accordingly, we recognized a gain of $625.6 million ($379.6 million after-tax) in fiscal 2015 in income from discontinued operations, to reflect the excess of the fair value of our interest over its carrying value at the time of the transfer. as part of the formation of ardent mills, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, pursuant to an agreement with the u.s. department of justice, we sold three flour milling facilities to miller milling company llc for $163.0 million. we received the cash proceeds from the sale of these flour milling facilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we used the net cash proceeds from the ardent mills transaction to repay debt. the operating results of our legacy milling business, including the disposition of three mills aforementioned, are included as discontinued operations and our equity in the earnings of ardent mills is reflected in our continuing operations within our consolidated statement of operations. the related assets and liabilities have been reclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale within our condensed consolidated balance sheet for the period presented prior to divestiture.
restructuring plans we previously announced a plan for the integration and restructuring of the operations of ralcorp, optimization of the entire company's supply chain network, manufacturing assets, and dry distribution and mixing centers, and improvement of selling, general and administrative effectiveness and efficiencies, which we refer to as the supply chain and administrative efficiency plan (the "scae plan"). although we announced on june 30, 2015 our intent to exit the private brands business, a divestiture of our private brands operations may not occur in a timely manner or at all. we will continue to implement portions of the scae plan, including work related to optimizing our supply chain network and pursue cost reductions through our selling, general and administrative functions and productivity improvements.
although we remain unable to make good faith estimates relating to the entire scae plan, we are reporting on actions initiated through the end of fiscal 2015, including the estimated amounts or range of amounts for each major type of costs expected to be incurred, and the charges that have resulted or will result in cash outflows. as of may 31, 2015, our board of directors has approved the incurrence of up to $394.0 million of expenses in connection with the scae plan. we have incurred or expect to incur approximately $267.3 million of charges ($177.3 million of cash charges and $90.0 million of non-cash charges) for actions identified to date under the scae plan. in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, we recognized charges of $85.2 million and $83.7 million, respectively, in relation to the scae plan. we expect to incur costs related to the scae plan over a multi-year period.
during fiscal 2012, we started incurring costs in connection with actions taken to attain synergies when integrating businesses acquired prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2013. these costs, collectively referred to as "acquisition-related restructuring costs", include severance and other costs associated with consolidating facilities and administrative functions. we have recognized cumulative pre-tax expenses of $23.7 million ($15.8 million of which have resulted in cash outflows) related to the acquisition-related restructuring costs. in fiscal 2015, we recognized charges of $0.3 million. in fiscal 2014, we recognized charges of $9.4 million, primarily representing costs related to asset impairments on equipment. the acquisition-related restructuring costs are substantially complete.
19
at the time of its acquisition, ralcorp had certain initiatives underway designed to optimize its manufacturing and distribution networks. we refer to these actions and the related costs as the "ralcorp pre-acquisition restructuring plans". these plans involved, among other things, the exit of certain manufacturing facilities. in connection with the ralcorp pre-acquisition restructuring plans, we have incurred $3.7 million of pre-tax charges ($1.9 million of which resulted in cash outflows). in fiscal 2014, we recognized charges of $2.4 million. at the end of fiscal 2014, the ralcorp pre-acquisition restructuring plans were substantially complete.
segment review we report our operations in three reporting segments: consumer foods, commercial foods, and private brands.
consumer foods the consumer foods reporting segment includes branded food sold in various retail channels primarily in north america. our food products are sold in a variety of categories (meals, entrees, condiments, sides, snacks, and desserts) in various retail channels across frozen, refrigerated, and shelf-stable temperature classes.
commercial foods the commercial foods reporting segment includes commercially branded and private branded food and ingredients, which are sold primarily to commercial, restaurants, foodservice, food manufacturing, and industrial customers. the segment's primary food items include: frozen potato and sweet potato items and a variety of vegetable, spice, bakery, and grain products which are sold under brands such as lamb weston® and spicetec flavors & seasonings®.
private brands the private brands reporting segment principally includes private brand and customized food products which are sold in various retail channels, primarily in north america. the products include a variety of categories including: bars, cereal, snacks, condiments, pasta, and retail bakery products. subsequent to fiscal 2015, on june 30, 2015, we announced our plan to exit the private brands operations.
presentation of derivative gains (losses) from economic hedges of forecasted cash flows in segment results derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. we believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions. as such, these derivatives are generally recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses. the gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings. in the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge, we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results, immediately.
the following table presents the net derivative gains (losses) from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions, under this methodology:

as of may 31, 2015, the cumulative amount of net derivative losses from economic hedges that had been recognized in general corporate expenses and not yet allocated to reporting segments was $23.3 million. this amount reflected net losses of $23.7 million incurred during the fiscal year ended may 31, 2015, as well as net gains of $0.4 million incurred prior to fiscal 2015. based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items, we expect to reclassify to segment operating results losses of $23.5 million in fiscal 2016 and gains of $0.2 million in fiscal 2017 and thereafter.
in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, management determined that certain derivatives that had been previously entered into as an economic hedge of forecasted commodity purchases had ceased to function as economic hedges. we recognized $18.9 million, $5.2 million, and $1.4 million of net derivative losses during fiscal 2015 within the operating results of the consumer foods, private brands, and commercial foods segments, respectively, in connection with these derivatives. management effectively exited these derivative positions in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.

overall, our net sales were $15.83 billion in fiscal 2015, essentially flat compared to fiscal 2014.
consumer foods net sales for fiscal 2015 were $7.30 billion, a decrease of $11.3 million compared to fiscal 2014. results reflected a volume benefit of approximately 1% in fiscal 2015 due to the inclusion of an additional week of results, offset by 1% decrease due to the impact of foreign exchange rates. in addition, we increased prices in fiscal 2015 for some categories to cover commodity costs.
sales of products associated with some of our most significant brands, including act ii®, chef boyardee®, hebrew national®, hunt's®, marie callender's®, odom's®, pam®, reddi-wip®, ro*tel®, and slim jim®, grew in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. significant brands whose products experienced sales declines in fiscal 2015 include bertolli®, blue bonnet®, healthy choice®, libby's®, orville redenbacher's®, peter pan®, snack pack®, swiss miss®, and wesson®.
commercial foods net sales were $4.46 billion in fiscal 2015, an increase of $131.0 million, or 3%, compared to fiscal 2014. results for fiscal 2015 reflected increased volumes in the lamb weston specialty potato products business and foodservice businesses due to the inclusion of an additional week of results. lamb weston results also reflected good domestic performance, more than offsetting the negative impact of the west coast labor dispute on international sales and challenges facing quick service restaurant customers.
private brands net sales for fiscal 2015 were $4.06 billion, a decrease of $130.9 million, or 3%, compared to fiscal 2014. the decreases in private brands net sales for fiscal 2015 reflected weak volumes resulting from an intense bidding environment and executional challenges, more than offsetting the benefit of the inclusion of an additional week of results in fiscal 2015.
selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expenses (includes general corporate expenses)
sg&a expenses totaled $3.47 billion for fiscal 2015, an increase of $700.9 million compared to fiscal 2014. we estimate that the inclusion of an extra week in the fiscal 2015 results increased sg&a expenses by approximately $30 million.
sg&a expenses for fiscal 2015 reflected the following:
•   charges of $1.59 billion related to impairment of goodwill, other intangibles, and fixed assets impacting reporting units within our private brands segment,
•   a decrease in advertising and promotion spending of $69.8 million,
•   a decrease in salaries and wages of $57.3 million, in connection with our efficiency and effectiveness initiatives,

consumer foods operating profit for fiscal 2015 was $1.07 billion, an increase of $177.7 million, or 20%, compared to fiscal 2014. gross profits in consumer foods were flat compared to fiscal 2014, driven by the impact of comparable net sales, discussed above, favorable product mix and improved plant productivity, offset by $18.9 million of net derivative losses in
22
connection with certain derivatives that ceased to function as economic hedges and higher commodity costs. operating profit was favorably impacted by the decrease in advertising and promotion expenses of $63.4 million and lower salaries expense. the decrease in advertising expense reflected a continually increasing focus on prioritization, efficiency, and return on investment. consumer foods operating profit in fiscal 2015 included a charge of $4.8 million related to impairment of the poppycock® brand intangible asset. operating profit for the consumer foods segment for fiscal 2015 also includes $31.7 million of estimated negative impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. charges totaling $35.4 million related to our restructuring plans also impacted consumer foods results in fiscal 2015, compared to $25.6 million in fiscal 2014. in fiscal 2014, consumer foods operating profit included charges of $72.5 million related to impairment of intangible assets, principally the chef boyardee® brand. charges of $1.8 million for transaction-related expenses also impacted fiscal 2014 consumer foods operating profit.
operating profit for the commercial foods segment was $568.5 million in fiscal 2015, an increase of $30.8 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2014. gross profits in the commercial foods segment were flat compared to fiscal 2014. commercial foods recognized $1.4 million of net derivative losses in connection with certain derivatives that ceased to function as economic hedges. the increases in operating profits reflected good domestic performance (discussed above), a better quality raw potato crop, and good operating efficiencies; collectively, these more than offset lower profits from international sales. international sales and profits were weak, resulting from challenges facing quick-serve restaurant customers in key asian markets and the impact of the slowdown from the west coast port labor dispute. the west coast port labor dispute was resolved toward the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2015. commercial foods operating profit also included charges of $3.2 million and $4.8 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to the execution of our restructuring plans. commercial foods operating profit for fiscal 2014 also included a charge of $16.5 million in connection with the impairment of a small production facility, as well as a charge of $8.9 million for the impairment of certain nonoperating assets and a $5.1 million gain from the sale of land, both related to assets received in connection with the bankruptcy of an onion products supplier.
private brands operating loss for fiscal 2015 and 2014 was $1.46 billion and $373.4 million, respectively. gross profits were $114.2 million lower in fiscal 2015 than in fiscal 2014. gross profits in fiscal 2015 included $5.2 million of net derivative losses in connection with certain derivatives that ceased to function as economic hedges. in fiscal 2015 and 2014, we recognized charges of $1.59 billion and $605.4 million, respectively, in connection with the impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets, and fixed assets within the private brands segment. additional decreases were driven by the impact of lower net sales, discussed above, and higher commodity costs (particularly for durum wheat and tree nuts). private brands operating profit in fiscal 2015 and 2014 also included $36.1 million and $35.9 million, respectively, of charges related to the execution of our restructuring plans. the company is working to improve execution in its private brands segment, including increasing speed of responsiveness to customers and commercialization of new products, improving fill rates and on-time deliveries, and better commodity cost management. subsequent to fiscal 2015, on june 30, 2015, we announced our plan to exit the private brands operations.
interest expense, net in fiscal 2015, net interest expense was $331.9 million, a decrease of $47.5 million, or 13%, from fiscal 2014. the decrease reflects the repayment of debt and other debt financing actions. interest expense in fiscal 2015 and 2014 reflected a net benefit of $8.0 million and $12.1 million, respectively, primarily resulting from interest rate swaps used to effectively convert the interest rates of certain outstanding debt instruments from fixed rate to floating rate.
income taxes our income tax expense was $234.0 million and $220.1 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. income tax expense for fiscal 2015 reflected an impairment of goodwill that is largely non-deductible for tax purposes. the implementation of new positions we are taking on tax credits that apply to prior year tax returns also resulted in an income tax benefit of $10.9 million in fiscal 2015. income tax expense for fiscal 2014 also reflected an impairment of goodwill that is largely non-deductible for tax purposes. the fiscal 2014 effective tax rate also included a change in estimate related to tax methods used for certain international sales, favorable tax adjustments resulting from changes in legal structure and state tax filing positions, resolution of foreign tax matters that were previously reserved, the effect of a law change in mexico requiring deconsolidation for tax reporting purposes, and the resolution of certain income tax matters related to dispositions of foreign operations in prior years.
we expect our effective tax rate in fiscal 2016, exclusive of any unusual transactions or tax events, to be approximately 33%-34%.
23
equity method investment earnings we include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates. significant affiliates include the ardent mills joint venture and affiliates that produce and market potato products for retail and foodservice customers. our share of earnings from our equity method investments was $122.1 million ($119.1 million in the commercial foods segment and $3.0 million in the consumer foods segment) and $32.5 million ($29.7 million in the commercial foods segment and $2.8 million in the consumer foods segment) in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increase in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 reflects the earnings from the ardent mills joint venture as well as higher profits for an international potato joint venture. the earnings from the ardent mills joint venture reflect results for 11 months of operations, as we recognize earnings on a one-month lag, due to differences in fiscal year periods. in fiscal 2014, earnings also reflected a $3.4 million charge reflecting the year-end write-off of actuarial losses in excess of 10% of the pension liability for an international potato venture.
results of discontinued operations our discontinued operations generated after-tax income of $366.6 million and $141.4 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. the results of discontinued operations for fiscal 2015 include a pre-tax gain of $625.6 million ($379.6 million after-tax) recognized on the formation of the ardent mills joint venture. the results for fiscal 2014 reflect a pre-tax gain of $90.0 million ($55.7 million after-tax) related to the disposition of three flour milling facilities as part of the ardent mills formation.
in fiscal 2014, we also completed the sale of a small snack business, medallion foods, for $32.0 million in cash. we recognized an after-tax loss of $3.5 million on the sale of this business in fiscal 2014. in fiscal 2014, we recognized an impairment charge related to allocated amounts of goodwill and intangible assets, totaling $15.2 million after-tax, in anticipation of this divestiture. we also completed the sale of the assets of the lightlife® business for $54.7 million in cash. we recognized an after-tax gain of $19.8 million on the sale of this business in fiscal 2014.
earnings (loss) per share diluted loss per share in fiscal 2015 was $0.60, including a loss of $1.46 per diluted share from continuing operations and earnings of $0.86 per diluted share from discontinued operations. diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2014 were $0.70, including $0.37 per diluted share from continuing operations and $0.33 per diluted share from discontinued operations. see "items impacting comparability" above as several significant items affected the comparability of year-over-year results of operations.

overall, our net sales increased $2.37 billion to $15.84 billion in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, primarily related to the acquisition of ralcorp.
consumer foods net sales for fiscal 2014 were $7.32 billion, a decrease of $235.7 million, or 3%, compared to fiscal 2013. results reflected a 3% decrease in volume performance and a 1% decrease due to the impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by a 1% increase in price/mix. volume performance from our base businesses for fiscal 2014 was impacted negatively by competitor promotional activity. significant slotting and promotion investments related to new product launches, particularly in the first quarter, also weighed heavily on net sales in fiscal 2014. in addition, certain shipments planned for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 were shifted to the first quarter of fiscal 2015 as a result of change in timing of retailer promotions and this negatively impacted volume performance.
24
sales of products associated with some of our most significant brands, including bertolli®, hunt's®, odom's®, libby's®, reddi-wip®, ro*tel®, slim jim®, and swiss miss® grew in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013. significant brands whose products experienced sales declines in fiscal 2014 include act ii®, banquet®, chef boyardee®, healthy choice®, marie callender's®, orville redenbacher's®, snack pack®, and wesson®. a significant portion of the overall volume decline was driven by healthy choice®, orville redenbacher's®, and chef boyardee® (which collectively have annual sales in excess of $1 billion).
commercial foods net sales were $4.33 billion in fiscal 2014, an increase of $222.5 million, or 5%, compared to fiscal 2013. results for fiscal 2014 reflected a 5% benefit from the acquisition of the frozen bakery business of ralcorp in january 2013. results for fiscal 2014 also reflected increased volume of 2% in the segment's lamb weston specialty potato products business, driven by increased sales to international customers, partially offset by lower price/mix. sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 to international customers were favorably impacted by increased promotional activity and accelerated orders due to concerns about the effect of a potential external labor dispute on west coast exports. sales volume in the foodservice business decreased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 due to industry trends.
private brands net sales for fiscal 2014 were $4.20 billion. the increase of $2.39 billion represented a full year of ownership of the legacy ralcorp business in fiscal 2014 compared to four months in fiscal 2013.
selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expenses (includes general corporate expenses)
sg&a expenses totaled $2.77 billion for fiscal 2014, an increase of $705.3 million compared to fiscal 2013. the increase in overall sg&a occurred as a result of the additional eight months of sg&a expenses for the ralcorp business as well as the following changes from our base business:

operating profit for the commercial foods segment was $537.7 million in fiscal 2014, a decrease of $47.8 million, or 8%, compared to fiscal 2013. gross profits in the commercial foods segment were $35.6 million lower in fiscal 2014 than in fiscal 2013. decreases in operating profit for fiscal 2014 were driven by lower gross profit in the lamb weston specialty potato operations related to the change in mix of sales to international and retail customers due to the impact of a major foodservice customer not renewing a sizable amount of potato business at the end of fiscal 2013, moderate inflation in key inputs, and poor quality raw potatoes affecting plant recovery and throughputs. the significant decreases in lamb weston results were offset by significant reductions in incentive compensation expenses in fiscal 2014. commercial foods operating profit for fiscal 2014 also included a charge of $16.5 million in connection with the impairment of a small production facility, as well as a charge of $8.9 million for the impairment of certain nonoperating assets and a $5.1 million gain from the sale of land, both related to assets received in connection with the bankruptcy of an onion products supplier. in addition, there were $4.8 million of charges in connection with our restructuring plans. results for fiscal 2013 reflected a $10.2 million charge to reduce the carrying value of collateral received in connection with the bankruptcy of the onion products supplier to its estimated fair value based upon updated appraisals. commercial foods operating profit also included $6.1 million of charges in fiscal
26
2013 related to the execution of our restructuring plans. included in the results of the commercial foods operating profit in fiscal 2013 was $3.1 million of incremental cost of goods sold due to the fair value adjustment to inventory resulting from acquisition accounting.
private brands segment operating loss for fiscal 2014 was $373.4 million, compared to an operating profit for fiscal 2013 of $125.4 million. the majority of our private brands segment is comprised of the former ralcorp business. the increase in net sales, discussed above, reflects the impact of the ralcorp acquisition. operating profits have been below expectations due to sales force, supply chain, and pricing actions, as well as cost challenges associated with integration and business transition. in fiscal 2014, we recognized charges of $605.4 million in connection with the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets within the private brands segment. also included in the operating loss for fiscal 2014 were $35.9 million of charges in connection with our restructuring plans. included in the results of the private brands operating profit in fiscal 2013 was $13.6 million of incremental cost of goods sold due to the fair value adjustment to inventory resulting from acquisition accounting.
interest expense, net in fiscal 2014, net interest expense was $379.4 million, an increase of $103.2 million, or 37%, from fiscal 2013. the increase reflects the issuance of $3.975 billion of senior debt, outstanding borrowings of $900 million under a term loan facility, and $716.0 million of senior debt that was exchanged in january 2013 in financing the ralcorp acquisition, in addition to the issuance of $750.0 million of senior notes in september 2012. interest expense in fiscal 2014 and 2013 reflected a net benefit of $12.1 million and $8.6 million, respectively, primarily resulting from interest rate swaps used to effectively convert the interest rates of certain outstanding debt instruments from fixed rate to floating rate.
income taxes our income tax expense was $220.1 million and $361.9 million in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. the effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was 56% for fiscal 2014 and 34% in fiscal 2013. the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 reflects the incurrence of an impairment of intangible assets, $529.2 million of which was non-deductible goodwill, as well as the benefit of normal, recurring, income tax credits and deductions, some of which expired on december 31, 2013. during fiscal 2015, these income tax credits and deductions were extended through december 31, 2014. accordingly, the related income tax benefit was recognized in fiscal 2015. the fiscal 2014 effective tax rate also included a change in estimate related to tax methods used for certain international sales, favorable tax adjustments resulting from changes in legal structure and state tax filing positions, resolution of foreign tax matters that were previously reserved, the effect of a law change in mexico requiring deconsolidation for tax reporting purposes, and the resolution of certain income tax matters related to dispositions of foreign operations in prior years. the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 reflects the incurrence of various non-deductible transaction-related expenses, as well as a reduced domestic manufacturing deduction benefit, in connection with the acquisition of ralcorp. the fiscal 2013 effective tax rate also included favorable tax adjustments resulting from the implementation of the 2012 american taxpayer relief act during fiscal 2013.
equity method investment earnings we include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates. significant affiliates produce and market potato products for retail and foodservice customers. our share of earnings from our equity method investments was $32.5 million ($29.7 million in the commercial foods segment and $2.8 million in the consumer foods segment) and $37.5 million ($35.7 million in the commercial foods segment and $1.8 million in the consumer foods segment) in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. in fiscal 2014, earnings also reflected a $3.4 million charge reflecting the year-end write-off of actuarial losses in excess of 10% of the pension liability of an international potato venture.
results of discontinued operations our discontinued operations generated after-tax income of $141.4 million and $87.7 million in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively.
the results for fiscal 2014 reflect a pre-tax gain of $90.0 million ($55.7 million after-tax) related to the disposition of three flour milling facilities as part of the ardent mills formation.
in fiscal 2014, we also completed the sale of a small snack business, medallion foods, for $32.0 million in cash. we recognized an after-tax loss of $3.5 million on the sale of this business in fiscal 2014. in fiscal 2014, we recognized an
27
impairment charge related to allocated amounts of goodwill and intangible assets, totaling $15.2 million after-tax, in anticipation of this divestiture. we also completed the sale of the assets of the lightlife® business for $54.7 million in cash. we recognized an after-tax gain of $19.8 million on the sale of this business in fiscal 2014.
earnings per share our fiscal 2014 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.70, including $0.37 per diluted share from continuing operations and income of $0.33 per diluted share from discontinued operations. our fiscal 2013 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.85, including $1.64 per diluted share from continuing operations and income of $0.21 per diluted share from discontinued operations.
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity and capital our primary financing objective is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives. if necessary, we use short-term debt principally to finance ongoing operations, including our seasonal requirements for working capital and a combination of equity and long-term debt to finance both our base working capital needs and our non-current assets. we are committed to maintaining an investment grade credit rating.
at may 31, 2015, we had a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. the facility is scheduled to mature in september 2018. the facility has historically been used principally as a back-up facility for our commercial paper program. as of may 31, 2015, there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility. the facility requires that our consolidated funded debt not exceed 65%of our consolidated capital base and that our fixed charges coverage ratio be greater than 1.75 to 1.0. on march 23, 2015, the company entered into an amendment to the facility to exclude certain goodwill and other intangible asset impairments from the calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio. as of may 31, 2015, we were in compliance with these financial covenants.
as of may 31, 2015, we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. the highest level of borrowings during fiscal 2015 was $685.8 million. as of may 25, 2014, we had $137.0 million in borrowings under our commercial paper program.
in january 2013, we borrowed $1.5 billion under a term loan facility ("term loan facility") as part of the financing used to acquire ralcorp. during the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we repaid the $900.0 million remaining principal balance and associated accrued interest, and terminated the term loan facility. we were allowed to prepay borrowings without premium or penalty.
on july 21, 2014, we issued floating rate senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $550.0 million due july 2016. the notes carry an interest rate equal to the three-month libor plus 0.37%. the net proceeds were used to repay $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2023, $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2043, $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2019, $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2018, and $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2017, in each case prior to maturity in a tender offer, and reduce our commercial paper balances.
as of the end of fiscal 2015, our senior long-term debt ratings were all investment grade. a significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility, although borrowing costs would increase. a downgrade of our short-term credit ratings would impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations, as well as making access to commercial paper more difficult.
we repurchase our shares of common stock from time to time after considering market conditions and in accordance with repurchase limits authorized by our board of directors. in december 2011, the company's board of directors approved a $750.0 million increase to our share repurchase authorization. under the share repurchase authorization, we may repurchase our shares periodically over several years, depending on market conditions and other factors, and may do so in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. the authorization has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $50.0 million under this program in fiscal 2015. the company's total remaining share repurchase authorization as of may 31, 2015 was $131.9 million.
28
in fiscal 2015, we received $505.4 million in cash (net of $49.0 million contributed to ardent mills) upon the formation of ardent mills, which included $163.0 million associated with the sale of three flour milling facilities in fiscal 2014 and a payment of $11.5 million to ardent mills for a working capital adjustment in the second quarter of fiscal 2015.
in fiscal 2015, the company completed its multi-year debt reduction goal of repaying $2.1 billion between the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and the end of fiscal 2015, exceeding the goal of $2.0 billion of debt repayment in that time period. despite the progress in debt reduction, the company continues to have a substantial amount of debt outstanding. given weaker-than-planned operating performance, the company's leverage ratios are still higher than targeted, so debt reduction is expected to remain a component of capital allocation in the foreseeable future.
on june 30, 2015, the company announced its intention to sell the private brands operations. at this time the impact of the sale of these operations on the company's liquidity is unknown.
cash flows in fiscal 2015, we generated $1.48 billion from operating activities, used $41.6 million for investing activities, used $1.43 billion for financing activities, and had a decrease of $8.8 million in cash due to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations totaled $1.47 billion in fiscal 2015, as compared to $1.45 billion generated in fiscal 2014. operating cash outflows for interest payments decreased $57.9 million to $337.7 million in fiscal 2015 as a result of the decreases in outstanding debt. we contributed $13.5 million and $18.3 million to our pension plans in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. we paid approximately $86.0 million less in annual incentive compensation payments in fiscal 2015 (earned in fiscal 2014) than in fiscal 2014 (earned in fiscal 2013). increases in inventory in fiscal 2015 resulted from lower volumes in international shipments in our fiscal third quarter due to the slowdown from the west coast port labor dispute, expansion of our potato manufacturing capacity in the united states and china, higher durum wheat costs, and larger harvests of corn, tomatoes, and potatoes. reductions in cash outflows for advertising and promotions in our consumer foods business have been largely offset by increases in trade promotions. during fiscal 2015, our income tax payments were approximately $47.7 million more than those made in fiscal 2014, due primarily to prior year income tax deductions related to the ralcorp debt exchange and ralcorp loss carryforwards from fiscal 2013. we received dividends of $77.9 million from our investment in the ardent mills joint venture during fiscal 2015. cash generated from operating activities of discontinued operations was $6.9 million and $114.0 million in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively, reflecting the timing of the milling business disposition.
investing activities used $41.6 million in fiscal 2015 versus $531.5 million in fiscal 2014. investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2015 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $471.9 million and acquisitions of a potato manufacturer in china and an organic frozen food business in the united states totaling $95.7 million. capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 were lower than fiscal 2014 as a result of fewer significant plant expansions and improvements. in fiscal 2014, we purchased certain frozen dessert production assets for $39.9 million million. the fiscal 2015 investments were offset by $391.4 million in cash received from ardent mills in connection with the formation of that joint venture. cash generated from investing activities of discontinued operations in fiscal 2015 totaled $114.0 million resulting from receipt of $163.0 million cash associated with the sale of three flour milling facilities at the end of fiscal 2014, partially offset by $49.0 million cash contributed to ardent mills upon the formation of the joint venture. investing activities of discontinued operations generated $58.2 million in fiscal 2014 primarily from the sale of assets of the lightlife and medallion foods businesses offset by capital expenditures in our former milling operations.
cash used for financing activities of continuing operations totaled $1.43 billion in fiscal 2015 compared to $1.03 billion in fiscal 2014. in fiscal 2015, we repaid $1.50 billion of long-term debt, partially financed by the issuance of $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes. we also reduced short term debt, primarily commercial paper, by $150.0 million. in fiscal 2014, we decreased our total debt by $612.4 million, including the repayment of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.875% senior notes upon maturity in april 2014. during fiscal 2015 and 2014, we paid dividends of $425.2 million and $420.9 million, respectively. in fiscal 2015 and 2014, we repurchased $50.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively, of our common stock as part of our share repurchase program. amounts generated from proceeds of employee stock option exercises and issuance of other stock awards were $153.8 million and $103.7 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively.
29
the company had cash and cash equivalents of $183.1 million at may 31, 2015 and $141.3 million at may 25, 2014, of which $102.3 million at may 31, 2015 and $104.5 million at may 25, 2014 was held in foreign countries. as of may 31, 2015 and may 25, 2014, certain of the company's foreign subsidiaries had extended short term loans to domestic entities totaling $36.4 million and $37.8 million, respectively. domestic entities repaid these amounts early in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. the company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment outside the united states, with the balance available to be repatriated to the united states. the cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future foreign investments. no related tax liability has been accrued as of may 31, 2015. at may 31, 2015, management does not intend to permanently repatriate additional foreign cash. any future decision to repatriate foreign cash could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax liability after considering available foreign tax credits and other tax attributes. it is not practicable to determine the amount of any such deferred tax liability at this time.
our preliminary estimate of capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 is approximately $575 million. this includes amounts attributable to the private brands operations we intend to divest.
management believes that existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, existing credit facilities, and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months.
off-balance sheet arrangements we use off-balance sheet arrangements (e.g., leases accounted for as operating leases) where sound business principles warrant their use. we also periodically enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. these are described further in "obligations and commitments," below.
variable interest entities not consolidated we have variable interests in certain entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities, but for which we are not the primary beneficiary. we do not consolidate the financial statements of these entities.
we hold a 50.0% interest in lamb weston rdo, a potato processing venture. we provide all sales and marketing services to lamb weston rdo. we receive a fee for these services based on a percentage of the net sales of the venture. we reflect the value of our ownership interest in this venture in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets, based upon the equity method of accounting. the balance of our investment was $14.6 million and $12.6 million at may 31, 2015 and may 25, 2014, respectively, representing our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with this venture. the capital structure of lamb weston rdo includes owners' equity of $29.2 million and term borrowings from banks of $41.6 million as of may 31, 2015. we have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of this venture.
we lease certain office buildings from entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities. the lease agreements with these entities include fixed-price purchase options for the assets being leased, representing our only variable interest in these lessor entities. these leases are accounted for as operating leases, and accordingly, there are no material assets or liabilities associated with these entities included in our consolidated balance sheets. we have no material exposure to loss from our variable interests in these entities. we have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities. in making this determination, we have considered, among other items, the terms of the lease agreements, the expected remaining useful lives of the assets leased, and the capital structure of the lessor entities.
obligations and commitments as part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements, debt agreements, and unconditional purchase obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices, such as "take-or-pay" contracts). the unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in our normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available. of these items, debt, notes payable, and capital lease obligations, which totaled $7.8 billion as of may 31, 2015, were recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. operating lease obligations and
30
unconditional purchase obligations, which totaled $2.4 billion as of may 31, 2015, were not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
a summary of our contractual obligations as of may 31, 2015 was as follows:

1 amount includes open purchase orders and agreements, some of which are not legally binding and/or may be cancellable. such agreements are generally settleable in the ordinary course of business in less than one year.
we are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our long-term debt and capital lease obligations. the weighted average coupon interest rate of the long-term debt obligations outstanding as of may 31, 2015 was approximately 4.1%.
the operating lease obligations noted in the table above have not been reduced by non-cancellable sublease rentals of $29.6 million.
we own a 49.99% interest in lamb weston bsw, llc ("lamb weston bsw"), a potato processing venture with ochoa ag unlimited foods, inc. ("ochoa"). we provide all sales and marketing services to lamb weston bsw. under certain circumstances, we could be required to compensate ochoa for lost profits resulting from significant production shortfalls ("production shortfalls"). commencing on june 1, 2018, or on an earlier date under certain circumstances, we have a contractual right to purchase the remaining equity interest in lamb weston bsw from ochoa (the "call option"). we are currently subject to a contractual obligation to purchase all of ochoa's equity investment in lamb weston bsw at the option of ochoa (the "put option"). the purchase prices under the call option and the put option (the "options") are based on the book value of ochoa's equity interest at the date of exercise, as modified by an agreed-upon rate of return for the holding period of the investment balance. the agreed-upon rate of return varies depending on the circumstances under which any of the options are exercised. as of may 31, 2015, the price at which ochoa had the right to put its equity interest to us was $41.6 million. this amount, which is presented within other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, is not included in the "contractual obligations" table above as the payment is contingent upon the exercise of the put option by ochoa, and the eventual occurrence and timing of such exercise is uncertain.
as part of our ongoing operations, we also enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event (e.g., guarantees of debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform). in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the following commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. a summary of our commitments, including commitments associated with equity method investments, as of may 31, 2015, was as follows:

we are a party to various potato supply agreements. under the terms of certain such potato supply agreements, we have guaranteed repayment of short-term bank loans of the potato suppliers, under certain conditions. at may 31, 2015, the amount
31
of supplier loans effectively guaranteed by us was $39.3 million, included in the table above. we have not established a liability for these guarantees, as we have determined that the likelihood of our required performance under the guarantees is remote.
federal income tax credits were generated related to our sweet potato production facility in delhi, louisiana. third parties invested in these income tax credits. we have guaranteed these third parties the face value of these income tax credits over their statutory lives, through fiscal 2017, in the event that the income tax credits are recaptured or reduced. the face value of the income tax credits was $26.7 million, included in the table above, as of may 31, 2015. we believe the likelihood of the recapture or reduction of the income tax credits is remote, and therefore we have not established a liability in connection with this guarantee.
we hold a fifty percent ownership interest in lamb-weston/meijer, v.o.f. ("lamb weston meijer"), a netherlands joint venture, headquartered in the netherlands, that manufactures and sells frozen potato products principally in europe. we and our partner are jointly and severally liable for all legal liabilities of lamb weston meijer. as of may 31, 2015 and may 25, 2014, the total liabilities of lamb weston meijer were $129.1 million and $144.7 million, respectively. lamb weston meijer is well capitalized, with partners' equity of $255.9 million and $247.0 million as of may 31, 2015 and may 25, 2014, respectively. we have not established a liability on our balance sheets for the obligations of lamb weston meijer, as we have determined the likelihood of any required payment by us to settle such liabilities of lamb weston meijer is remote.
the obligations and commitments tables above do not include any reserves for uncertainties in income taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes. the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at may 31, 2015 was $73.7 million. the net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at may 31, 2015, that, if recognized, would impact our effective tax rate was $43.2 million. recognition of these tax benefits would have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate.
critical accounting estimates the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management. the estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with management's understanding of current facts and circumstances. certain of our accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management. the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management.
our audit/finance committee has reviewed management's development, selection, and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates.
marketing costs-we incur certain costs to promote our products through marketing programs, which include advertising, customer incentives, and consumer incentives. we recognize the cost of each of these types of marketing activities as incurred in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. the judgment required in determining marketing costs can be significant. for volume-based incentives provided to customers, management must continually assess the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets. similarly, for consumer coupons, management must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by consumers in the future. estimates made by management in accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends. as these factors change, management's estimates could change and we could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over different periods of time.
we have recognized reserves of $159.9 million for these marketing costs as of may 31, 2015. changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual customer marketing program would not result in a material change in our results of operations or cash flows.
advertising and promotion expenses totaled $344.2 million, $414.0 million, and $463.4 million in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
income taxes-our income tax expense is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining our income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. management reviews tax positions at least quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. such assets arise because of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in our balance sheets, as well as from net operating
32
loss and tax credit carryforwards. management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies. these estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment. management uses historical experience and short and long-range business forecasts to develop such estimates. further, we employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. to the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established.
further information on income taxes is provided in note 15 "pre-tax income and income taxes" to the consolidated financial statements.
environmental liabilities-environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated. management works with independent third-party specialists in order to effectively assess our environmental liabilities. management estimates our environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required clean-up, our known volumetric contribution, other potentially responsible parties, and our experience in remediating sites. environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of clean-up. management's estimate as to our potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements. insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims. we do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable. to the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above, management's estimate of environmental liabilities may also change.
we have recognized a reserve of approximately $55.0 million for environmental liabilities as of may 31, 2015. the reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy. in fiscal 2013, we made an adjustment to the reserve of $4.5 million to increase our estimate based on expected payments.
employment-related benefits-we incur certain employment-related expenses associated with pensions, postretirement health care benefits, and workers' compensation. in order to measure the annual expense associated with these employment-related benefits, management must make a variety of estimates including, but not limited to, discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities, assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses, compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, anticipated health care costs, and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to us. the estimates used by management are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances. we use third-party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employment-related benefits. different estimates used by management could result in us recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time.
we have recognized a pension liability of $573.7 million and $451.8 million, a postretirement liability of $235.3 million and $283.2 million, and a workers' compensation liability of $100.1 million and $107.7 million, as of the end of fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. we also have recognized a pension asset of $20.5 million and $18.8 million as of the end of fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively, as certain individual plans of the company had a positive funded status.
we recognize cumulative changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation ("the corridor") in current period expense annually as of our measurement date, which is our fiscal year-end, or when measurement is required otherwise under generally accepted accounting principles.
we recognized pension expense (benefit) from company plans of $0.9 million, $(5.9) million, and $23.5 million in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. such amounts reflect the year-end write-off of actuarial losses in excess of 10% of our pension liability of $6.9 million, $3.4 million, and $5.7 million in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. this also reflected expected returns on plan assets of $267.9 million, $252.9 million, and $216.4 million in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. we contributed $13.5 million, $18.3 million, and $19.8 million to our pension plans in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. we anticipate contributing approximately $13.0 million to our pension plans in fiscal 2016.
one significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate. we select a discount rate each year (as of our fiscal year-end measurement date) for our plans based upon a hypothetical bond portfolio for which the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the year-by-year projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans. the hypothetical bond
33
portfolio is comprised of high-quality fixed income debt instruments (usually moody's aa) available at the measurement date. based on this information, the discount rate selected by us for determination of pension expense was 4.15% for fiscal 2015, 4.05% for fiscal 2014, and 4.5% for fiscal 2013. we selected a discount rate of 4.10% for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2016. a 25 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2015 would have resulted in a decrease of $2.9 million in our pension expense for fiscal 2015. a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2015 would have resulted in an increase of $89.0 million in our pension expense for fiscal 2015. the disproportionate impact on pension expense of a reduction of our discount rate is due to our policy of writing-off actuarial losses in excess of 10% of our pension liability immediately. for our year-end pension obligation determination, we selected discount rates of 4.10% and 4.15% for fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively.
another significant assumption used to account for our pension plans is the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. in developing the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense, we consider long-term historical returns (arithmetic average) of the plan's investments, the asset allocation among types of investments, estimated long-term returns by investment type from external sources, and the current economic environment. based on this information, we selected 7.75% for the long-term rate of return on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2015 pension expense. a 25 basis point increase/decrease in our expected long-term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2015 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for our pension plans by $8.7 million. we selected an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75% to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2016. a 25 basis point increase/decrease in our expected long-term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2016 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for our pension plans by $8.7 million.
the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information for pension plans. we determine this assumption based on our long-term plans for compensation increases and current economic conditions. based on this information, we selected 3.70% and 4.25% for fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively, as the rate of compensation increase for determining our year-end pension obligation. we selected 4.25% for the rate of compensation increase for determination of pension expense for each of fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013. a 25 basis point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2015 would increase pension expense for our pension plans by $0.8 million for the year. a 25 basis point decrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2015 would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by $1.2 million for the year. we selected a rate of 3.70% for the rate of compensation increase to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2016. a 25 basis point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2016 would increase pension expense for our pension plans by $1.1 million for the year. a 25 basis point decrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2016 would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by $1.6 million for the year.
in october 2014, the society of actuaries' retirement plan experience committee published new mortality tables and recommended their use for the measurement of u.s. pension plan obligations. with the assistance of our third-party actuary, in measuring our pension obligations as of may 31, 2015, we incorporated revised assumptions that generally reflect the mortality improvement inherent in these new tables, as adjusted for experience specific to our industry.
we also provide certain postretirement health care benefits. we recognized postretirement benefit expense of $6.1 million, $9.9 million, and $8.8 million in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. we reflected liabilities of $235.3 million and $283.2 million in our balance sheets as of may 31, 2015 and may 25, 2014, respectively. we anticipate contributing approximately $23.7 million to our postretirement health care plans in fiscal 2016.
the postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on our assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts. these assumptions include discount rates (discussed above), health care cost trend rates, inflation rates, retirement rates, mortality rates (also discussed above), and other factors. the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook, and an assessment of likely long-term trends. assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators. retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. the discount rate we selected for determination of postretirement expense was 3.65% for fiscal 2015, 3.35% for fiscal 2014, and 3.9% for fiscal 2013. we have selected a weighted-average discount rate of 3.5% for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2016. a 25 basis point increase/decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2015 would not have resulted in a material change to postretirement expense for our plans. we have assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 9.0%, with the trend rate decreasing to 4.5% by 2023. a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects:
34
($ in millions)                                        one percentincrease   one percentdecrease effect on total service and interest cost                    $0.6            $(0.5             )
effect on postretirement benefit obligation   14.0                           (12.5             )
we provide workers' compensation benefits to our employees. the measurement of the liability for our cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs. one significant assumption we make is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our obligation. the weighted-average discount rate used at may 31, 2015 was 2.16%. a 25 basis point increase/decrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers' compensation expense.
business combinations, impairment of long-lived assets (including property, plant and equipment), identifiable intangible assets, and goodwill-we use the acquisition method in accounting for acquired businesses. under the acquisition method, our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing of the acquisition. the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired, particularly intangible assets. as a result, in the case of significant acquisitions we normally obtain the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets. the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of marketplace participants. while management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.
we reduce the carrying amounts of long-lived assets (including property, plant and equipment) to their fair values when their carrying amount is determined to not be recoverable. we generally compare undiscounted estimated future cash flows of an asset or asset group to the carrying values of the asset or asset group. if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows exceed the carrying values of the asset or asset group, no impairment is recognized. if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying values of the asset or asset group, we write-down the asset or assets to their estimated fair values. the estimates of fair value are generally in the form of appraisal, or by discounting estimated future cash flows of the asset or asset group.
determining the useful lives of intangible assets also requires management judgment. certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands, while other acquired intangible assets (e.g., customer relationships) are expected to have determinable useful lives. our estimates of the useful lives of definite-lived intangible assets are primarily based upon historical experience, the competitive and macroeconomic environment, and our operating plans. the costs of definite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life.
we reduce the carrying amounts of indefinite-lived intangible assets, and goodwill to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts (i.e., assets are deemed to be impaired). fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. when determining future cash flow estimates, we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions, industry-specific conditions, product pricing, and necessary capital expenditures. the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts (or none at all) for long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets.
in assessing other intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, then we are not required to perform any additional tests for assessing intangible assets for impairment. however, if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment, then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test that involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
35
if we perform a quantitative impairment test in evaluating impairment of our indefinite lived brands/trademarks, we utilize a "relief from royalty" methodology. the methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated "royalty rate" we would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand. when determining the future cash flow estimates, we must estimate future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each applicable brand and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. estimating future net sales requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions, product pricing, and consumer trends. in determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows, we consider the current interest rate environment and our estimated cost of capital.
in fiscal 2015, we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles. during fiscal 2015, we recognized impairment charges of $43.7 million in our private brands segment to write-down various brands. we also recognized impairment charges of $4.8 million in our consumer foods segment for our poppycock® brand and a $0.3 million impairment charge in our commercial foods segment for a small brand.
in fiscal 2014, we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles. we recognized impairment charges of $72.5 million in our consumer foods segment, primarily for our chef boyardee® brand, and a $3.2 million impairment charge in our private brands segment for two small brands. we also recognized a $3.2 million impairment charge for an amortizable technology license in our corporate expenses in fiscal 2014.
goodwill is tested annually for impairment of value and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired. a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have negative effects on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill.
in testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (more than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test, otherwise no further analysis is required. we also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test.
under the qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified (similar to impairment indicators above). furthermore, management considers the results of the most recent two-step quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital between the current and prior years for each reporting unit.
under the two-step quantitative impairment test, the first step of the evaluation involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the reporting unit being tested for impairment as well as to select a risk-adjusted discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. when determining future cash flow estimates, we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. we estimate cash flows for the reporting unit over a discrete period (typically four or five years) and the terminal period (considering expected long term growth rates and trends). estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions, industry-specific conditions, product pricing, and necessary capital expenditures. the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows or significant changes in risk-adjusted discounts rates due to changes in market conditions could produce substantially different estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit.
if the fair value of a reporting unit determined in the first step of the evaluation is lower than its carrying value, we proceed to the second step, which compares the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value. in estimating the implied fair value of goodwill for a reporting unit, we must assign the fair value of the reporting unit (as determined in the first step) to the assets and liabilities associated with the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination (i.e., we estimate the fair value of each asset and liability held in the reporting unit). the various assets and liabilities within the reporting unit are generally not adjusted to their new, estimated fair values (unless impairments of any individual assets are indicated). the implied goodwill is equal to the residual of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair values of each identifiable asset and liability within the reporting unit. any excess of the carrying value of goodwill of the reporting unit over its implied fair value is recorded as impairment.

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, in conjunction with our annual review for impairment, we performed a qualitative analysis of goodwill for the reporting units in our consumer foods and commercial foods segments. the results of the qualitative analysis did not result in further testing of impairment.
because forecasted sales and profits for the private brands segment continued to fall below our expectations relative to our previous projections throughout fiscal 2015, we performed quantitative analyses of goodwill on certain of our private brands segment reporting units in the second, third, and fourth quarters of fiscal 2015. estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and future industry and economic conditions. we estimated the future cash flows of each reporting unit within the private brands segment and calculated the net present value of those estimated cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate, in order to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit from the perspective of a market participant. we used discount rates and terminal growth rates of 8% and 3%, respectively, to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows. we then compared the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the respective historical carrying value (including allocated assets and liabilities of certain shared and corporate functions), and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value for six of our reporting units within the private brands segment throughout fiscal 2015. with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, we estimated the fair value of the assets and liabilities of each of these reporting units in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill of each reporting unit. we recognized impairment charges for the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and the carrying value of goodwill within each reporting unit at the respective measurement dates. accordingly, during fiscal 2015, we recorded charges totaling $1.53 billion for the impairment of goodwill in the private brands segment. the following reporting units within private brands were impacted: $328.7 million in bars and coordinated, $195.1 million in cereal, $157.1 million in pasta, $536.5 million in snacks, $174.4 million in retail bakery, and $136.1 million in condiments.
during fiscal 2014, we recorded a $602.2 million charge for the impairment of goodwill in the private brands segment. the following reporting units within private brands were impacted: $66.4 million in bars and coordinated, $154.6 million in cereal, $94.2 million in pasta, $231.6 million in snacks, and $55.4 million in retail bakery.
in the case of four reporting units within the private brands segment: cereal, pasta, snacks, and retail bakery, the estimated fair value of certain amortizing intangible assets (customer relationships) used in step two of our impairment analysis was substantially less than the carrying value of those assets and, as a result, the carrying value of the cereal, pasta, snacks, and retail bakery reporting units exceeded the estimated fair values of those reporting units, even after the previously described goodwill impairment charges were recorded. we assess the recoverability of these amortizing intangibles at the segment level and expect to recover the carrying value over their remaining lives (on an undiscounted basis) and, accordingly, no impairments were required to be recognized.
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we concluded that, due to a decline in estimated future cash flows, there was an indicator of impairment for certain property, plant, and equipment within the private brands segment. as a result, we reviewed the long-lived assets for impairment and recorded a $13.7 million impairment charge within the private brands segment. the impairment was measured based upon an estimated disposal value for the related production facility.
following the impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2015, the carrying value of goodwill in our private brands reporting units included $269.3 million for cereal, $588.2 million for pasta, $276.5 million for snacks, and $535.5 million for retail bakery. all of the goodwill for the bars and coordinated and condiments reporting units was impaired as of the end of fiscal 2015. if the future performance of one or more of the reporting units within the private brands segment falls short of our expectations or if there are significant changes in risk-adjusted discount rates due to changes in market conditions, we could be required to recognize additional, material impairment charges in future periods.

recently issued accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. the asu will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("u.s. gaap"). on july 9, 2015, the fasb deferred the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year. based on the fasb's asu, we will apply the new revenue standard in our fiscal year 2019. early adoption in our fiscal year 2018 is permitted. we are evaluating the effect that asu 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. the standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which appear elsewhere in this report. it contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly under the headings "item 1a - risk factors" and "forward-looking statements."
general we report our results through five segments: assurant solutions, assurant specialty property, assurant health, assurant employee benefits, and corporate and other. the corporate and other segment includes activities of the holding company, financing and interest expenses, net realized gains (losses) on investments and investment income earned from short-term investments held. the corporate and other segment also includes the amortization of deferred gains associated with the sales of ffg and ltc, through reinsurance agreements as described below.
the following discussion covers the twelve months ended december 31, 2015 ("twelve months 2015"), twelve months ended december 31, 2014 ("twelve months 2014") and twelve months ended december 31, 2013 ("twelve months 2013"). please see the discussion that follows, for each of these segments, for a more detailed analysis of the fluctuations.
executive summary consolidated net income decreased $329,352, or 70%, to $141,555 for twelve months 2015 from $470,907 for twelve months 2014. the decrease was primarily related to higher loss experience and adverse claims development on 2015 individual major medical policies, a reduction in the 2014 estimated recoveries from the affordable care act risk mitigation programs and $106,389 (after-tax) of exit and disposal costs, including premium deficiency reserve accruals, severance and retention costs, long-lived asset impairments and other costs associated with our exit from the health insurance market.
assurant solutions net income decreased $21,765, or 10%, to $197,183 for twelve months 2015 from $218,948 for twelve months 2014. the decrease was primarily due to the previously disclosed loss of a domestic mobile tablet program and declining service contract volumes at certain north american retail clients.
total revenues were relatively flat at $4,178,140 for twelve months 2015 compared with $4,179,360 for twelve months 2014. net earned premiums decreased $113,022 primarily due to foreign exchange volatility, the loss of a domestic mobile tablet program and the continued run-off of our credit insurance business. these items were partially offset by growth from our auto warranty business and from a large domestic service contract client.
overall, we expect assurant solutions 2016 net income and net earned premiums and fees to increase from twelve months 2015 amounts. results are expected to improve in the second half of 2016 driven by new mobile programs, improved international profitability and additional expense initiatives. foreign exchange volatility, lower service contract revenue from legacy north american retail clients and continued run-off in credit insurance will impact results.
assurant specialty property net income decreased $34,052, or 10%, to $307,705 for twelve months 2015 from $341,757 for twelve months 2014. the decrease is primarily due to the previously disclosed loss of client business and ongoing normalization in our lender-placed homeowners insurance business, partially offset by more favorable non-catastrophe loss experience and lower catastrophe reinsurance costs. the divestiture of american reliable insurance company ("aric") also contributed to the decrease in net income.
total revenues decreased $365,948 to $2,543,105 for twelve months 2015 from $2,909,053 for twelve months 2014. the decrease was primarily due to the divestiture of aric, combined with lower lender-placed homeowners insurance net earned premiums. the decline in lender-placed homeowners insurance net earned premiums is primarily due to a decline in placement rates, lower premium rates and previously disclosed loss of client business. these items were partially offset by an increase in fees and other income reflecting contributions from mortgage solutions businesses.
the twelve months 2015 expense ratio increased 620 basis points compared with twelve months 2014. the increase was primarily due to lower net earned premiums and higher legal costs related to outstanding matters. in addition, growth in fee-based businesses, which have higher expense ratios than our insurance products, contributed to the increase.
for 2016, we expect assurant specialty property net income and net earned premiums to decrease compared with twelve months 2015 reflecting the ongoing normalization of lender-placed insurance business partially offset by increased efficiencies, including the implementation of new technology, and other expense savings initiatives. contributions from multi-family housing and mortgage solutions businesses are expected to partially offset the decline. in addition, catastrophe losses may affect overall results.

as previously announced, the company concluded a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives for its health business and expects to substantially complete the process to exit the health insurance market in 2016. during the remainder of the exit process, we expect to incur up to $50,000 of additional exit-related charges, as well as certain overhead expenses that are excluded from the premium deficiency reserve accrual.
in addition, the company signed a definitive agreement to sell its assurant employee benefits segment to sun life. the transaction is expected to close by the end of first quarter 2016.
for more information, see notes 3 and 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
critical factors affecting results our results depend on the appropriateness of our product pricing, underwriting and the accuracy of our methodology for the establishment of reserves for future policyholder benefits and claims, returns on and values of invested assets and our ability to manage our expenses. factors affecting these items, including unemployment, difficult conditions in financial markets and the global economy, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. for more information on these factors, see "item 1a - risk factors."
management believes the company will have sufficient liquidity to satisfy its needs over the next twelve months including the ability to pay interest on our senior notes and dividends on our common stock.
for twelve months 2015, net cash provided by operating activities, including the effect of exchange rate changes and the reclassification of assets held for sale on cash and cash equivalents, totaled $192,483; net cash provided by investing activities totaled $264,293 and net cash used in financing activities totaled $487,127. we had $1,288,305 in cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2015. please see " - liquidity and capital resources," below for further details.
revenues we generate revenues primarily from the sale of our insurance policies and service contracts and from investment income earned on our investments. sales of insurance policies are recognized in revenue as earned premiums while sales of administrative services are recognized as fee income.
under the universal life insurance guidance, income earned on preneed life insurance policies sold after january 1, 2009 are presented within policy fee income net of policyholder benefits. under the limited pay insurance guidance, the consideration received on preneed policies sold prior to january 1, 2009 is presented separately as net earned premiums, with policyholder benefits expense being shown separately.
our premium and fee income is supplemented by income earned from our investment portfolio. we recognize revenue from interest payments, dividends and sales of investments. currently, our investment portfolio is primarily invested in fixed maturity securities. both investment income and realized capital gains on these investments can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
interest rate volatility can increase or reduce unrealized gains or losses in our investment portfolios. interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. fluctuations in interest rates affect our returns on, and the market value of, fixed maturity and short-term investments.
the fair market value of the fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio and the investment income from these securities fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions. the fair market value generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us from future investments in fixed maturity securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates. we also have investments that carry pre-payment risk, such as mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. interest rate fluctuations may cause actual net investment income and/or cash flows from such investments to differ from estimates made at the time of investment. in periods of declining interest rates, mortgage prepayments generally increase and mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage obligations and bonds are more likely to be prepaid or redeemed as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates. therefore, in these circumstances we may be required to reinvest those funds in lower-interest earning investments.
expenses our expenses are primarily policyholder benefits, underwriting, general and administrative expenses and interest expense.
policyholder benefits are affected by our claims management programs, reinsurance coverage, contractual terms and conditions, regulatory requirements, economic conditions, and numerous other factors. benefits paid or reserves required for
37
future benefits could substantially exceed our expectations, causing a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
underwriting, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of commissions, premium taxes, licenses, fees, amortization of deferred costs, general operating expenses and income taxes.
we incur interest expense related to our debt.
critical accounting estimates certain items in our consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and judgment. differences between actual results and these estimates could in some cases have material impacts on our consolidated financial statements.
the following critical accounting policies require significant estimates. the actual amounts realized in these areas could ultimately be materially different from the amounts currently provided for in our consolidated financial statements.
health insurance premium rebate liability the affordable care act was signed into law in march 2010. one provision of the affordable care act, effective january 1, 2011, established a minimum medical loss ratio ("mlr") designed to ensure that a minimum percentage of premiums is paid for clinical services or health care quality improvement activities. the affordable care act established an mlr of 80% for individual and small group business and 85% for large group business. if the actual loss ratios, calculated in a manner prescribed by the department of health and human services ("hhs"), are less than the required mlr, premium rebates are payable to the policyholders by august 1 of the subsequent year.
the assurant health loss ratio reported in "results of operations" below (the "gaap loss ratio") differs from the loss ratio calculated under the mlr rules. the most significant differences include: the fact that the mlr is calculated separately by state, legal entity and type of coverage (individual or group); the mlr calculation includes credibility adjustments for each state/entity/coverage cell, which are not applicable to the gaap loss ratio; the mlr calculation applies only to some of our health insurance products, while the gaap loss ratio applies to the entire portfolio, including products not governed by the affordable care act; the mlr includes quality improvement expenses, taxes and fees; changes in reserves and affordable care act risk mitigation program amounts are treated differently in the mlr calculation; the mlr premium rebate amounts are considered adjustments to premiums for gaap reporting whereas they are reported as additions to incurred claims in the mlr rebate estimate calculations; and the mlr is calculated using a rolling three years of experience while the gaap loss ratio represents the current year only.
assurant health has estimated the 2015 impact of this regulation based on definitions and calculation methodologies outlined in the hhs regulations and guidance. the estimate was based on separate projection models for individual medical and small group business using projections of expected premiums, claims, and enrollment by state, legal entity and market for medical businesses subject to mlr requirements for the mlr reporting year. in addition, the projection models include quality improvement expenses, state assessments, taxes, and estimated impacts of the affordable care act risk mitigation programs (commonly referred to as the "3r's"). the premium rebate is presented as a reduction of net earned premiums in the consolidated statement of operations and included in unearned premiums in the consolidated balance sheet.
affordable care act risk mitigation programs beginning in 2014, the affordable care act introduced new and significant premium stabilization programs. these programs, discussed in further detail below, are meant to mitigate the potential adverse impact to individual health insurers as a result of affordable care act provisions that became effective january 1, 2014.a three-year (2014-2016) reinsurance program provides reimbursement to insurers for high cost individual business sold on or off the public marketplaces. the reinsurance entity established by hhs is funded by a per-member reinsurance fee assessed on all commercial medical plans, including self-insured group health plans. only affordable care act individual plans are eligible for recoveries if claims exceed a specified threshold, up to a reinsurance cap. reinsurance contributions associated with affordable care act individual plans are reported as a reduction in net earned premiums in the consolidated statements of operations, and estimated reinsurance recoveries are established as reinsurance recoverables in the consolidated balance sheets with an offsetting reduction in policyholder benefits in the consolidated statement of operations. reinsurance fee contributions for non-affordable care act business are reported in underwriting, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.
38
a permanent risk adjustment program transfers funds from insurers with lower risk populations to insurers with higher risk populations based on the relative risk scores of participants in affordable care act plans in the individual and small group markets, both on and off the public marketplaces. based on the risk of its members compared to the total risk of all members in the same state and market, considering data obtained from industry studies, the company estimates its year-to-date risk adjustment transfer amount. the company records a risk adjustment transfer receivable (payable) in premiums and accounts receivable (unearned premium) in the consolidated balance sheets, with an offsetting adjustment to net earned premiums in the consolidated statements of operations when the amounts are reasonably estimable and collection is reasonably assured.
a three-year (2014-2016) risk corridor program limits insurer gains and losses by comparing allowable medical costs to a target amount as defined by hhs. this program applies to a subset of affordable care act eligible individual and small group products certified as qualified health plans. the public marketplace can only sell qualified health plans. in addition, carriers who sell qualified health plans on the public marketplace can also sell them off the public marketplace. variances from the target amount exceeding certain thresholds may result in amounts due to or due from hhs. during 2015, the company participated in the federal insurance public marketplaces so the risk corridor program is applicable. however, as the current full funding for this program is unclear at this time, no accruals were established for any receivable amounts from this program for 2015, so there was no impact on the company's 2015 operations. the company does not anticipate any payables into this program for 2015.
reserves reserves are established in accordance with gaap using generally accepted actuarial methods and reflect judgments about expected future claim payments. calculations incorporate assumptions about inflation rates, the incidence of incurred claims, the extent to which all claims have been reported, future claims processing, lags and expenses and future investment earnings, and numerous other factors. while the methods of making such estimates and establishing the related liabilities are periodically reviewed and updated, the calculation of reserves is not an exact process.
reserves do not represent precise calculations of expected future claims, but instead represent our best estimates at a point in time of the ultimate costs of settlement and administration of a claim or group of claims, based upon actuarial assumptions and projections using facts and circumstances known at the time of calculation.
many of the factors affecting reserve adequacy are not directly quantifiable and not all future events can be anticipated when reserves are established. reserve estimates are refined as experience develops. adjustments to reserves, both positive and negative, are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such estimates are updated.
because establishment of reserves is an inherently complex process involving significant judgment and estimates, there can be no certainty that ultimate losses will not exceed existing claim reserves. future loss development could require reserves to be increased, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings in the periods in which such increases are made. see "item 1a - risk factors - risks related to our company - our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims, and this may require us to establish additional reserves that may materially affect our results of operations, profitability and capital" for more detail on this risk.

for a description of our reserving methodology, see note 13 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
long duration contracts reserves for future policy benefits represent the present value of future benefits to policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums. reserve assumptions reflect best estimates for expected investment yield, inflation, mortality, morbidity, expenses and withdrawal rates. these assumptions are based on our experience to the extent it is credible, modified where appropriate to reflect current trends, industry experience and provisions for possible unfavorable deviation. we also record an unearned revenue reserve which represents premiums received which have not yet been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations.
historically, premium deficiency testing on continuing lines of business has not resulted in material adjustments to deferred acquisition costs or reserves. such adjustments could occur, however, if economic or mortality conditions significantly deteriorated.
risks related to the reserves recorded for certain discontinued individual life, annuity, and long-term care insurance policies have been 100% ceded via reinsurance. while the company has not been released from the contractual obligation to the policyholders, changes in and deviations from economic, mortality, morbidity, and withdrawal assumptions used in the calculation of these reserves will not directly affect our results of operations unless there is a default by the assuming reinsurer.
short duration contracts claims and benefits payable reserves for short duration contracts include (1) case reserves for known claims which are unpaid as of the balance sheet date; (2) ibnr reserves for claims where the insured event has occurred but has not been reported to us as of the balance sheet date; and (3) loss adjustment expense reserves for the expected handling costs of settling the claims. periodically, we review emerging experience and make adjustments to our reserves and assumptions where necessary. below are further discussions on the reserving process for our major short duration products.
group disability and group term life
40
case or claim reserves are set for active individual claims on group long term disability policies and for waiver of premium benefits on group term life policies. reserve factors used to calculate these reserves reflect assumptions regarding disabled life mortality and claim recovery rates, claim management practices, awards for social security and other benefit offsets and yield rates earned on assets supporting the reserves. group long term disability and group term life waiver of premium reserves are discounted because the payment pattern and ultimate cost are fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis.
factors considered when setting ibnr reserves include patterns in elapsed time from claim incidence to claim reporting, and elapsed time from claim reporting to claim payment.
key sensitivities at december 31, 2015 for group long term disability claim reserves include the discount rate and claim termination rates:
claims andbenefits payable                                                             claims andbenefits payable group disability, discount rate decreased by 100 basis points            $1,251,532              group disability, claim termination rate 10% lower             $1,224,925

the discount rate is also a key sensitivity for group term life waiver of premium reserves (included within group term life reserves).
claims and benefits payable group term life, discount rate decreased by 100 basis points                $206,000

group term life, discount rate increased by 100 basis points                $190,392
medical ibnr reserves calculated using generally accepted actuarial methods represent the largest component of reserves for short duration medical claims and benefits payable. the primary methods we use in their estimation are the loss development method and the projected claim method. under the loss development method, we estimate ultimate losses for each incident period by multiplying the current cumulative losses by the appropriate loss development factor. when there is not sufficient data to reliably estimate reserves under the loss development method, such as for recent claim periods, the projected claim method is used. this method utilizes expected ultimate loss ratios to estimate the required reserve. where appropriate, we also use variations on each method or a blend of the two.
reserves for our various product lines are calculated using experience data where credible. if sufficient experience data is not available, data from other similar blocks may be used. industry data provides additional benchmarks when historical experience is too limited. reserve factors may also be adjusted to reflect considerations not reflected in historical experience, such as changes in claims inventory levels, changes in provider negotiated rates or cost savings initiatives, increasing or decreasing medical cost trends, product changes and demographic changes in the underlying insured population.
key sensitivities as of december 31, 2015 for short duration medical reserves include claims processing levels, claims under case management, medical inflation, seasonal effects, medical provider discounts and product mix. the effects of these sensitivities can be summarized by adjusting loss development factors, as follows:
claims and benefits payable short duration medical, loss development factors 1% lower*                 $508,811
short duration medical, as reported                                        $488,811
short duration medical, loss development factors 1% higher*                $470,811
*   this refers to loss development factors for the most recent four months. our historical claims experience indicates that approximately 87.5% of medical claims are paid within four months of the incurred date.
changes in medical loss development may increase or decrease the mlr rebate liability.

property and warranty our property and warranty lines of business include lender-placed homeowners, manufactured housing homeowners, multi-family housing, credit property, credit unemployment and warranty insurance and some longer-tail coverages (e.g. asbestos, environmental, other general liability and personal accident). claim reserves for these lines are calculated on a product line basis using generally accepted actuarial principles and methods. they consist of case and ibnr reserves. the method we most often use in setting our property and warranty reserves is the loss development method. under this method, we estimate ultimate losses for each accident period by multiplying the current cumulative losses by the appropriate loss development factor. we then calculate the reserve as the difference between the estimate of ultimate losses and the current case-incurred losses (paid losses plus case reserves). we select loss development factors based on a review of historical averages, adjusted to reflect recent trends and business-specific matters such as current claims payment practices.
the loss development method involves aggregating loss data (paid losses and case-incurred losses) by accident quarter (or accident year) and accident age for each product or product grouping. as the data ages, we compile loss development factors that measure emerging claim development patterns between reporting periods. by selecting the most appropriate loss development factors, we project the known losses to an ultimate incurred basis for each accident period.
the data is typically analyzed using quarterly paid losses and/or quarterly case-incurred losses. some product groupings may also use annual paid loss and/or annual case-incurred losses, as well as other actuarially accepted methods.
each of these data groupings produces an indication of the loss reserves for the product or product grouping. the process to select the best estimate differs by line of business. the single best estimate is determined based on many factors, including but not limited to:
•   the nature and extent of the underlying assumptions;
•   the quality and applicability of historical data - whether internal or industry data;
•   current and future market conditions - the economic environment will often impact the development of loss triangles;
•   the extent of data segmentation - data should be homogeneous yet credible enough for loss development methods to apply; and
•   the past variability of loss estimates - the loss estimates on some product lines will vary from actual loss experience more than others.
most of our credit property and credit unemployment insurance business is either reinsured or written on a retrospective commission basis. business written on a retrospective commission basis permits management to adjust commissions based on claims experience. thus, any adjustment to prior years' incurred claims is partially offset by a change in commission expense, which is included in the underwriting, general and administrative expenses line in our consolidated statements of operations.
while management has used its best judgment in establishing its estimate of required reserves, different assumptions and variables could lead to significantly different reserve estimates. two key measures of loss activity are loss frequency, which is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure, and loss severity, which is a measure of the average size of claims. factors affecting loss frequency include the effectiveness of loss controls and safety programs and changes in economic activity or weather patterns. factors affecting loss severity include changes in policy limits, retentions, rate of inflation and judicial interpretations.
if the actual level of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected, the ultimate reserves required will be different than management's estimate. the effect of higher and lower levels of loss frequency and severity levels on our ultimate costs for claims occurring in 2015 would be as follows:
change in both loss frequency andseverity for all property and warranty        ultimate cost of claimsoccurring in 2015   change in cost of claimsoccurring in 2015

reserving for asbestos and other claims
42
our property and warranty line of business includes exposure to asbestos, environmental and other general liability claims arising from our participation in various reinsurance pools from 1971 through 1985. this exposure arose from a contract that we discontinued writing many years ago. we carry case reserves, as recommended by the various pool managers, and ibnr reserves totaling $30,519 (before reinsurance) and $27,721 (net of reinsurance) at december 31, 2015. we believe the balance of case and ibnr reserves for these liabilities are adequate. however, any estimation of these liabilities is subject to greater than normal variation and uncertainty due to the general lack of sufficiently detailed data, reporting delays and absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for those exposures. there are significant unresolved industry legal issues, including such items as whether coverage exists and what constitutes a claim. in addition, the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of losses to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain. however, based on information currently available, and after consideration of the reserves reflected in the consolidated financial statements, we do not believe that changes in reserve estimates for these claims are likely to be material.
deferred acquisition costs only direct incremental costs associated with the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts are deferred, to the extent that such costs are deemed recoverable from future premiums or gross profits. acquisition costs primarily consist of commissions and premium taxes. certain direct response advertising expenses are deferred when the primary purpose of the advertising is to elicit sales to customers who can be shown to have specifically responded to the advertising and the direct response advertising results in probable future benefits.
the deferred acquisition costs ("dac") asset is tested annually to ensure that future premiums or gross profits are sufficient to support the amortization of the asset. such testing involves the use of best estimate assumptions to determine if anticipated future policy premiums and investment income are adequate to cover all dac and related claims, benefits and expenses. to the extent a deficiency exists, it is recognized immediately by a charge to the consolidated statements of operations and a corresponding reduction in the dac asset. if the deficiency is greater than unamortized dac, a liability will be accrued for the excess deficiency.
long duration contracts acquisition costs for preneed life insurance policies issued prior to january 1, 2009 and certain discontinued life insurance policies have been deferred and amortized in proportion to anticipated premiums over the premium-paying period. these acquisition costs consist primarily of first year commissions paid to agents.
for preneed investment-type annuities, preneed life insurance policies with discretionary death benefit growth issued after january 1, 2009, universal life insurance policies and investment-type annuity contracts that are no longer offered, dac is amortized in proportion to the present value of estimated gross profits from investment, mortality, expense margins and surrender charges over the estimated life of the policy or contract. estimated gross profits include the impact of unrealized gains or losses on investments as if these gains or losses had been realized, with corresponding credits or charges included in aoci. the assumptions used for the estimates are consistent with those used in computing the policy or contract liabilities.
acquisition costs relating to group worksite products, which typically have high front-end costs and are expected to remain in force for an extended period of time, consist primarily of first year commissions to brokers, costs of issuing new certificates and compensation to sales representatives. these acquisition costs are front-end loaded, thus they are deferred and amortized over the estimated terms of the underlying contracts.
short duration contracts acquisition costs relating to property contracts, warranty and extended service contracts and single premium credit insurance contracts are amortized over the term of the contracts in relation to premiums earned.
acquisition costs relating to monthly pay credit insurance business consist mainly of direct response advertising costs and are deferred and amortized over the estimated average terms and balances of the underlying contracts.
acquisition costs relating to group term life, group disability, group dental and group vision consist primarily of compensation to sales representatives. these acquisition costs are front-end loaded; thus, they are deferred and amortized over the estimated terms of the underlying contracts.
investments we regularly monitor our investment portfolio to ensure investments that may be other-than-temporarily impaired are identified in a timely fashion, properly valued, and charged against earnings in the proper period. the determination that a security has incurred an other-than-temporary decline in value requires the judgment of management. assessment factors include, but are not limited to, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and rating of the issuer, whether any collateral is held, the intent and ability of the company to retain the investment
43
for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery for equity securities, and the intent to sell or whether it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell for fixed maturity securities.
any equity security whose price decline is deemed other-than-temporary is written down to its then current market value with the amount of the impairment reported as a realized loss in that period. the impairment of a fixed maturity security that the company has the intent to sell or that it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell is deemed other-than-temporary and is written down to its market value at the balance sheet date, with the amount of the impairment reported as a realized loss in that period. for all other-than-temporarily impaired fixed maturity securities that do not meet either of these two criteria, the company analyzes its ability to recover the amortized cost of the security by calculating the net present value of projected future cash flows. for these other-than-temporarily impaired fixed maturity securities, the net amount recognized in earnings is equal to the difference between its amortized cost and its net present value.
inherently, there are risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments. changes in circumstances and critical assumptions such as a continued weak economy, or unforeseen events which affect one or more companies, industry sectors or countries could result in additional impairments in future periods for other-than-temporary declines in value. see also note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and "item 1a - risk factors - risks related to our company - the value of our investments could decline, affecting our profitability and financial strength" and "investments" contained later in this item.
reinsurance reinsurance recoverables include amounts we are owed by reinsurers. reinsurance costs are expensed over the terms of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the policies. amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves and are reported in our consolidated balance sheets. an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers (net of collateral), reinsurer solvency, management's experience and current economic conditions. the ceding of insurance does not discharge our primary liability to our insureds.
the following table sets forth our reinsurance recoverables as of the dates indicated:
december 31, 2015       december 31, 2014
reinsurance recoverables   $7,470,403              $7,254,585
we have used reinsurance to exit certain businesses, including blocks of individual life, annuity, and long-term care business. the reinsurance recoverables relating to these dispositions amounted to $4,607,056 and $4,549,699 at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
in the ordinary course of business, we are involved in both the assumption and cession of reinsurance with non-affiliated companies. the following table provides details of the reinsurance recoverables balance for the years ended december 31:

we utilize reinsurance for loss protection and capital management, business dispositions and, in assurant solutions and assurant specialty property, client risk and profit sharing. see also "item 1a - risk factors - reinsurance may not be available or adequate to protect us against losses and we are subject to the credit risk of reinsurers," and "item 7a - quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - credit risk."
retirement and other employee benefits we sponsor a qualified pension plan, (the "assurant pension plan") and various non-qualified pension plans (including an executive pension plan), along with a retirement health benefits plan covering our employees who meet specified eligibility requirements. effective march 1, 2016, benefit accruals for the assurant pension plan, the various non-qualified pension plans and the retirement health benefits plan were frozen. the reported expense and liability associated with these plans requires an extensive use of assumptions which include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases. we determine these assumptions based upon currently available market and industry data, and
44
historical performance of the plan and its assets. the actuarial assumptions used in the calculation of our aggregate projected benefit obligation vary and include an expectation of long-term appreciation in equity markets which is not changed by minor short-term market fluctuations, but does change when large interim deviations occur. the assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants.
contingencies we account for contingencies by evaluating each contingent matter separately. a loss is accrued if reasonably estimable and probable. we establish reserves for these contingencies at the best estimate, or, if no one estimated amount within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other, we report an estimated reserve at the low end of the estimated range. contingencies affecting the company include litigation matters which are inherently difficult to evaluate and are subject to significant changes.
deferred taxes deferred income taxes are recorded for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the company expects the temporary differences to reverse. a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the asset will not be realized. the valuation allowance is sufficient to reduce the asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. the company has deferred tax assets resulting from temporary differences that may reduce taxable income in future periods. the detailed components of our deferred tax assets, liabilities and valuation allowance are included in note 8 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
as of december 31, 2014, the company had a cumulative valuation allowance of $18,164 against deferred tax assets of international subsidiaries. during twelve months 2015, the company recognized a cumulative income tax benefit of $4,946 primarily related to the release of a valuation allowance of certain international subsidiaries. as of december 31, 2015, the company has a cumulative valuation allowance of $13,218 against deferred tax assets, as it is management's assessment that it is more likely than not that this amount of deferred tax assets will not be realized. the realization of deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards of international subsidiaries depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character in the same jurisdiction.
in determining whether the deferred tax asset is realizable, the company weighed all available evidence, both positive and negative. we considered all sources of taxable income available to realize the asset, including the future reversal of existing temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences, carry forwards and tax-planning strategies.
the company believes it is more likely than not that the remainder of its deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. accordingly, other than noted herein for certain international subsidiaries, a valuation allowance has not been established.
future reversal of the valuation allowance will be recognized either when the benefit is realized or when we determine that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be realized. depending on the nature of the taxable income that results in a reversal of the valuation allowance, and on management's judgment, the reversal will be recognized either through other comprehensive income (loss) or through continuing operations in the consolidated statements of operations. likewise, if the company determines that it is not more likely than not that it would be able to realize all or part of the deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded through a charge to continuing operations in the consolidated statements of operations in the period such determination is made.
in determining the appropriate valuation allowance, management makes judgments about recoverability of deferred tax assets, use of tax loss and tax credit carryforwards, levels of expected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. the assumptions used in making these judgments are updated periodically by management based on current business conditions that affect the company and overall economic conditions. these management judgments are therefore subject to change based on factors that include, but are not limited to, changes in expected capital gain income in the foreseeable future and the ability of the company to successfully execute its tax planning strategies. please see "item 1a-risk factors-risks related to our company-unanticipated changes in tax provisions, changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could materially and adversely affect our results" for more information.
valuation and recoverability of goodwill goodwill represented $833,512 and $841,239 of our $30,043,128 and $31,562,466 of total assets as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we review our goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. such indicators include, but are not limited to, significant adverse change in legal factors,
45
adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, loss of key personnel or a significant decline in our expected future cash flows due to changes in company-specific factors or the broader business climate. the evaluation of such factors requires considerable judgment. any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
we have concluded that our reporting units for goodwill testing are equivalent to our operating segments. therefore, we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level.
the following table illustrates the amount of goodwill carried at each reporting unit:

in 2015, the company chose the option to perform qualitative assessments for our assurant solutions and assurant specialty property reporting units. this option allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. however, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the first step of the two-step impairment test.
we initially considered the 2014 quantitative analysis performed by the company whereby it compared the estimated fair value of the assurant solutions and assurant specialty property reporting units with their respective net book values ("step 1"). based on the 2014 step 1 tests, assurant solutions had an estimated fair value that exceeded its net book value by 25.4%, and assurant specialty property had an estimated fair value that exceeded its net book value by 33.3%.
based on our qualitative assessments, having considered the factors in totality we determined that it was not necessary to perform a step 1 quantitative goodwill impairment test for the assurant solutions and assurant specialty property reporting units and that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of each reporting unit continues to exceed its net book value in 2015. significant changes in the external environment or substantial declines in the operating performance of assurant solutions and assurant specialty property could cause us to reevaluate this conclusion in the future.
in undertaking our qualitative assessments for the assurant solutions and assurant specialty property reporting units, we considered macro-economic, industry and reporting unit-specific factors. these included (i.) the effect of the current interest rate environment on our cost of capital; (ii.) each reporting unit's ability to sustain market share over the year; (iii.) lack of turnover in key management; (iv.) 2015 actual performance as compared to expected 2015 performance from our 2014 step 1 assessment; and, (v.) the overall market position and share price of assurant, inc.

year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014
net income decreased $329,352, or 70%, to $141,555 for twelve months 2015 from $470,907 for twelve months 2014. the decrease was primarily related to higher loss experience and adverse claims development on 2015 individual major medical policies, a reduction in the 2014 estimated recoveries from the affordable care act risk mitigation program and $106,389 (after-tax) of exit and disposal costs, including premium deficiency reserves, severance and retention costs, long-lived asset impairments and other costs associated with our exit from the health insurance market. for more information see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013
net income decreased $18,000, or 4%, to $470,907 for twelve months 2014 from $488,907 for twelve months 2013. the decrease was primarily related to lower net income at assurant specialty property, a net loss at assurant health and a $19,400 (after-tax) loss associated with a divested business. please see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. these items were partially offset by improved results in our assurant solutions and assurant employee benefits segments, lower expenses in the corporate and other segment, an increase in net realized gains on investments and a favorable change in tax liabilities, including a $20,753 one-time tax benefit related to the conversion of the canadian branch operations of certain u.s. subsidiaries to foreign corporate entities. please see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014
net income segment net income decreased $21,765, or 10%, to $197,183 for twelve months 2015 from $218,948 for twelve months 2014. the decrease was primarily due to the previously disclosed loss of a domestic mobile tablet program and declining service contract volumes from north american retail clients.
total revenues total revenues were relatively flat at $4,178,140 for twelve months 2015 compared with $4,179,360 for twelve months 2014. net earned premiums decreased $113,022 primarily due to foreign exchange volatility, the loss of a domestic mobile tablet program, lower service contract volumes from north american retail clients and the continued run-off of our credit insurance business. these items were partially offset by growth from our auto warranty business and from a large domestic service contract client. fees and other income increased $117,759 primarily driven by contributions from global mobile programs and related services. a few significant clients continued to account for a substantial portion of segment revenues.
gross written premiums increased $473,445, or 9%, to $5,759,867 for twelve months 2015 from $5,286,422 for twelve months 2014. gross written premiums from our domestic service contract business increased $798,200, primarily driven by growth in the number of covered mobile devices and increased activity from existing clients in our auto warranty and extended service contract business. this increase was partially offset by the continued runoff of our credit insurance business and foreign exchange volatility.
preneed face sales decreased $33,350, or 3%, to $936,434 for twelve months 2015 from $969,784 for twelve months 2014. this decrease was mostly attributable to a change in product offerings, a client's temporary operational change, and foreign exchange volatility. on june 25, 2014, we extended our exclusive distribution partnership with services corporation international ("sci"), for an additional 10 years, through september 29, 2024.
total benefits, losses and expenses total benefits, losses and expenses increased $44,139, or 1%, to $3,901,666 for twelve months 2015 from $3,857,527 for twelve months 2014. policyholder benefits decreased $108,066 driven by favorable loss experience in our domestic service contract business and from our mobile business in europe. selling, underwriting and general expenses increased $152,205. commissions, taxes, licenses and fees, of which amortization of dac is a component, decreased $12,666 due to the loss of a domestic mobile tablet program. general expenses increased $164,871 primarily due to growth in our domestic mobile business and the 2014 cwi acquisition.
year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013
net income segment net income increased $93,796, or 75%, to $218,948 for twelve months 2014 from $125,152 for twelve months 2013. the increase was primarily driven by improved results in our domestic mobile business, reflecting growth in mobile subscribers, contributions from ongoing client marketing programs, continued favorable loss experience and expense savings in our domestic credit and domestic service contract businesses.
total revenues total revenues increased $618,987, or 17%, to $4,179,360 for twelve months 2014 from $3,560,373 for twelve months 2013. the increase was primarily driven by higher net earned premiums in our domestic and international service contract businesses. the increase in domestic service contract business reflects continued growth in mobile subscribers, growth at a large client due to increased subscribers and price increases as well as higher contributions from vehicle service contracts due to increased sales from new and existing dealers. the increase in international service contracts is due to growth in mobile subscribers. fees and other income increased $267,482 primarily driven by mobile client marketing programs and from the lifestyle service group ("lsg") acquisition in october 2013.
49
gross written premiums increased $910,407, or 21%, to $5,286,422 for twelve months 2014 from $4,376,015 for twelve months 2013. gross written premiums from our domestic service contract business increased $1,022,366 primarily driven by growth in mobile subscribers. gross written premiums from our international service contract business increased $45,653 primarily due to growth in the number of global mobile subscribers, the lsg acquisition and new and existing clients in latin america. this increase was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, primarily in latin america and canada.
preneed face sales decreased $38,131 or 4%, to $969,784 for twelve months 2014 from $1,007,915 for twelve months 2013. this decrease was mostly attributable to a change in product offerings and a client's temporary operational change.
total benefits, losses and expenses total benefits, losses and expenses increased $487,764, or 14%, to $3,857,527 for twelve months 2014 from $3,369,763 for twelve months 2013. policyholder benefits increased $131,965 primarily related to the lsg acquisition partially offset by favorable loss experience in our domestic mobile business. selling, underwriting and general expenses increased $355,799. commissions, taxes, licenses and fees, of which amortization of dac is a component, increased $82,828 due to higher net earned premiums in our domestic service contract and domestic mobile business. general expenses increased $272,971 primarily due to increased administration expenses directly related to growth in our domestic mobile business and expenses related to the lsg acquisition. these items were partially offset by expense savings in our domestic credit and domestic service contract businesses.

regulatory matters in january 2015, nydfs issued regulations regarding tracking costs associated with lender placed insurance rates. the company reached an agreement with the nydfs to file for a 6.2% reduction in lender-placed hazard insurance rates in new york. the rates have been filed and approved, and were effective for new and renewing policies starting february 1, 2016.
lender-placed insurance products accounted for 73% and 71% of net earned premiums for twelve months 2015 and twelve months 2014, respectively. the approximate corresponding contributions to the segment net income in these periods were 78% and 73%, respectively. the portion of total segment net income attributable to lender-placed products may vary substantially over time depending on the frequency, severity and location of catastrophic losses, the cost of catastrophe reinsurance and reinstatement coverage, the variability of claim processing costs and client acquisition costs, and other factors. in addition, we expect placement rates for these products to decline.
year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014
net income segment net income decreased $34,052, or 10%, to $307,705 for twelve months 2015 from $341,757 for twelve months 2014. the decrease is primarily due to the ongoing normalization in our lender-placed homeowners insurance business, previously disclosed loss of client business, and increased legal expenses, partially offset by more favorable non-catastrophe loss experience and lower catastrophe reinsurance costs. the divestiture of american reliable insurance company ("aric") also contributed to the decrease in net income.
total revenues total revenues decreased $365,948, or 13%, to $2,543,105 for twelve months 2015 from $2,909,053 for twelve months 2014. the decrease was primarily due to the divestiture of aric, combined with lower lender-placed homeowners insurance net earned premiums. the decline in lender-placed homeowners insurance net earned premiums is primarily due to a decline in placement rates, lower premium rates and previously disclosed loss of client business. these items were partially offset by an increase in fees and other income reflecting contributions from mortgage solutions businesses. a few significant clients continued to account for a substantial portion of segment revenues.
total benefits, losses and expenses total benefits, losses and expenses decreased $311,139 or 13%, to $2,079,486 for twelve months 2015 from $2,390,625 for twelve months 2014. the loss ratio decreased 470 basis points due to fewer non-catastrophe losses primarily attributable to lower frequency and severity of theft and fire claims and the impact of the aric divestiture, partially offset by lower premium rates from the implementation of a new lender-placed insurance product. reportable catastrophe losses for twelve months 2015 were $29,652 compared to $28,410 for twelve months 2014. reportable catastrophe losses include only individual catastrophic events that generated losses to the company in excess of $5,000, pre-tax and net of reinsurance. the expense ratio increased 620 basis points for twelve months 2015 compared with twelve months 2014 mainly due to lower lender-placed homeowners insurance net earned premiums and a higher mix of fee-based business.
year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013
net income segment net income decreased $81,829, or 19%, to $341,757 for twelve months 2014 from $423,586 for twelve months 2013. the decrease is primarily due to lower placement and premium rates and higher non-catastrophe losses in our lender-placed insurance business. twelve months 2013 results included a $14,000 (non-tax deductible) regulatory settlement with the nydfs.
total revenues total revenues increased $296,939, or 11%, to $2,909,053 for twelve months 2014 from $2,612,114 for twelve months 2013. the increase was primarily due to growth in lender-placed homeowners insurance net earned premiums, as well as fee income from the acquisitions of field asset services ("fas") and streetlinks. growth in lender-placed homeowners insurance was primarily due to the previously disclosed discontinuation of a client quota share reinsurance agreement and loan portfolios added in 2013 and was partially offset by the impact of lower placement and premium rates.

total benefits, losses and expenses total benefits, losses and expenses increased $431,943 or 22%, to $2,390,625 for twelve months 2014 from $1,958,682 for twelve months 2013. the loss ratio increased to 43.3% for twelve months 2014 from 37.4% for twelve months 2013 due to higher non-catastrophe losses from severe weather, high severity fire claims and lower premium rates from the new lender-placed homeowners insurance product. reportable catastrophe losses for twelve months 2014 were $28,410 compared to reportable catastrophe losses for twelve months 2013 of $29,503. reportable catastrophe losses include only individual catastrophic events that generated losses to the company in excess of $5,000, pre-tax and net of reinsurance. the expense ratio increased to 46.5% for twelve months 2014 from 42.5% for twelve months 2013 primarily due to growth in fee-based businesses. twelve months 2013 included a $14,000 (non-tax deductible) regulatory settlement with the nydfs.
assurant health as previously announced, the company concluded a comprehensive review of its portfolio and decided to sharpen its focus on specialty housing and lifestyle protection products and services. as a result, the company will exit the health insurance market. for more information, see notes 3 and 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. the company expects to substantially complete its exit of the health insurance market by the end of 2016.

the affordable care act most provisions of the affordable care act have now taken effect. given the sweeping nature of the changes represented by the affordable care act, our results of operations and financial position have been, and could in the future be, materially adversely affected. for more information, see item 1a, "risk factors - risk related to our industry - reform of the health insurance industry could materially reduce the profitability of certain of our businesses or render them unprofitable" in this report.
because all individuals now have a guaranteed right to purchase health insurance policies, the affordable care act introduced new and significant premium stabilization programs in 2014: reinsurance, risk adjustment, and risk corridor (together, the "3 rs"). these programs, discussed in further detail below, are meant to mitigate the potential adverse impact to individual health insurers as a result of affordable care act provisions that became effective january 1, 2014.
reinsurance this is a transitional program for 2014-2016, with decreasing benefit over the three years. all commercial individual and group medical health plans are required to contribute to the funding of the program. only individual health plans that are compliant with the essential health benefits of the affordable care act are eligible to receive benefits from the program.
we are required to make contributions, which are recorded quarterly, based on both our affordable care act and non-affordable care act business. contributions based on our non-affordable care act business are included in selling, underwriting and general expenses and contributions based on our affordable care act business are included as ceded premiums. recoveries are recorded quarterly as ceded policyholder benefits and reflect the anticipated experience of our affordable care act plans based on our analysis of current and historical claim data.
for the twelve months 2015, we recorded reinsurance contributions of $10,387 and reinsurance recoveries of $274,977 in our consolidated statements of operations. as of december 31, 2015, we recorded reinsurance contributions payable of $2,597 and reinsurance recoverables of $296,421 on our consolidated balance sheets. during 2015 we collected $255,536 under the 2014 program. both contributions payable and recoveries for the 2015 program are scheduled to be settled in 2016. included in the $274,977 is a $(21,444) change in our december 31, 2014 estimate pertaining to the 2014 program and $296,421 associated with the 2015 program. reinsurance recovery amounts are based on final notification from the centers for medicare and medicaid services ("cms").
risk adjustment this is a permanent program to transfer funds between health insurers based on the average health risk scores of their affordable care act insured populations. insurers with below-average risk scores will contribute into the pool. insurers with above-average risk scores will receive payments out of the pool.
risk scores are evaluated at the state, market, and legal entity level for affordable care act-compliant policies. risk adjustment amounts payable and receivable are reflected as adjustments to net earned premiums, and are recorded quarterly based on our current estimated loss experience of our affordable care act business.
based on the demographics of our affordable care act population, extensive analytical evaluations, current and historical claim data as well as other internal and external data sources, external market studies and other published data, we believe that our average risk scores will be significantly higher than the industry averages.
for the twelve months 2015, we recorded net risk adjustment premiums of $199,554 in our consolidated statements of operations, and we carried net risk adjustment receivables of $225,195 on our consolidated balance sheets. during 2015 we collected $96,247 under the 2014 program. risk transfer payments and receipts for the 2015 program are scheduled to be settled in 2016. included in the $199,554 of net risk adjustment premiums is a $(25,641) change in our december 31, 2014 estimate pertaining to the 2014 program and $225,195 associated with the 2015 program. risk adjustment recoverable amounts are based on final notifications from cms.
risk corridor this is a temporary risk-sharing program for 2014-2016. based on ratios of allowable costs to target costs as defined by the affordable care act, health insurers will make payments to the department of health and human services ("hhs") or receive funds from hhs. because assurant health did not participate in any public insurance marketplaces for 2014, risk
53
corridors have no impact on our 2014 operations. assurant health began participating in the public insurance marketplaces for 2015, however no net recoverable has been recorded for 2015 because payments from hhs under this program are uncertain.
estimates of amounts receivable from these programs are subject to considerable uncertainty and actual amounts received may vary substantially from our estimates.
year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014
net loss segment net loss increased $304,159, or 477%, to a net loss of $367,907 for twelve months 2015 from a net loss of $63,748 for twelve months 2014. the increase was primarily attributable to higher loss experience and adverse claims development on 2015 individual major medical policies, a reduction in the 2014 estimated recoveries from the affordable care act risk mitigation programs and $106,389 (after-tax) of exit and disposal costs, including premium deficiency reserves, severance and retention costs, long-lived asset impairments and similar exit and disposal costs related to the decision to exit the health business mentioned above.
total revenues total revenues increased $281,968, or 14%, to $2,302,805 for twelve months 2015 from $2,020,837 for twelve months 2014. net earned premiums from our individual medical business increased $351,002, or 23%, due to growth in the major medical product line. net earned premiums from our small employer group business decreased $72,758, or 18%, due to policy lapses and the sale of supplemental and small-group self-funded lines of business and certain assets to national general on october 1, 2015. for more information see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. fees and other income increased $14,606, or 37%, due to growth of our self funded product until its sale on october 1, 2015, noted above.
total benefits, losses and expenses total benefits, losses and expenses increased $757,210, or 37%, to $2,828,661 for twelve months 2015 from $2,071,451 for twelve months 2014. policyholder benefits increased $725,608, or 46%, and the loss ratio increased to 103.5% from 81.0%. the increase is primarily attributable higher loss experience and adverse claims development on 2015 individual major medical policies as well as the establishment of premium deficiency reserves. at december 31, 2015, a $78,047 premium deficiency reserve remains on the company's consolidated balance sheet. selling, underwriting and general expenses increased $31,602, or 6.4%, due to severance and retention costs, long-lived asset impairments and other exit and disposal costs, as well as a net $10,643 loss on the sale of our supplemental and small-group self-funded lines of business and certain assets to national general on october 1, 2015.
year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013
net (loss) income segment results decreased $69,605, or 1,188%, to a net loss of $63,748 for twelve months 2014 from net income of $5,857 for twelve months 2013. the decrease was primarily attributable to increased claims from the new affordable care act qualified policies, reflecting the guaranteed issue requirements and the health profiles of many first-time buyers, as well as a higher non-deductible expenses and reform fees related to the affordable care act. these items were partially offset by estimated recoveries from affordable care act risk mitigation programs.
total revenues total revenues increased $373,634, or 23%, to $2,020,837 for twelve months 2014 from $1,647,203 for twelve months 2013. net earned premiums from our individual medical business increased $370,827, or 32%, due to growth in individual major medical product sales, and estimated recoveries from the affordable care act's risk adjustment program.
total benefits, losses and expenses total benefits, losses and expenses increased $466,826, or 29%, to $2,071,451 for twelve months 2014 from $1,604,625 for twelve months 2013. policyholder benefits increased $406,558, or 35%, and the loss ratio increased to 81.0% from 73.9%. the increases in policyholder benefits and the loss ratio were primarily attributable to higher volumes of individual business and higher loss experience on individual affordable care act medical policies. selling, underwriting and general expenses increased $60,268, or 14%, due to higher commissions on new sales and health reform fees. fourth quarter 2013 included $4,589 of severance expense.

56
segment net loss decreased $31,983 or 43%, to $42,748 for twelve months 2015 compared with a net loss of $74,731 for twelve months 2014. the decrease is primarily due to a $10,016 (after-tax) gain on the sale of our vehicle title administration business in twelve months 2015, while twelve months 2014 includes a $19,400 (after-tax) loss on the sale of aric.
total revenues total revenues increased $19,404 or 24%, to $98,686 for twelve months 2015 compared with $79,282 for twelve months 2014. the increase in revenues is mainly due to a $16,773 gain on sale of our vehicle title administration business, mentioned above.
total benefits, losses and expenses total benefits, losses and expenses decreased $15,922 or 8%, to $185,551 in twelve months 2015 compared with $201,473 in twelve months 2014. this decrease is primarily attributable to a $21,526 loss on sale of aric included in twelve months 2014, mentioned above.
year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013
net loss segment net loss decreased $25,510 or 25%, to $74,731 for twelve months 2014 compared with a net loss of $100,241 for twelve months 2013. the decrease is primarily due to a $20,753 one-time tax benefit related to the conversion of the canadian branch operations of certain u.s. subsidiaries to foreign corporate entities, a $17,068 (after-tax) change in net realized gains on investments, lower employee-related costs and impact of expense reduction initiatives. these items were partially offset by a $19,400 (after-tax) loss on an asset held for sale.
total revenues total revenues increased $7,189 or 10%, to $79,282 for twelve months 2014 compared with $72,093 for twelve months 2013. the increase in revenues is mainly due to an $26,258 increase in net realized gains on investments partially offset by a decrease of $17,816 in amortization of deferred gain on disposal of businesses ("amortization of deferred gain"). the reduction in the amortization of deferred gain is related to a change in estimate for the recognition of a deferred gain associated with ffg that we previously sold through reinsurance.
total benefits, losses and expenses total benefits, losses and expenses decreased $19,600 or 9%, to $201,473 in twelve months 2014 compared with $221,073 in twelve months 2013. interest expense declined $19,340 primarily due to repayment of the 2004 senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $500,000 on february 18, 2014. included in selling, underwriting and general expenses is a $21,526 loss on an asset held for sale. excluding this item, twelve months 2014 had lower selling, underwriting and general expenses compared with twelve months 2013 primarily due to lower employee-related costs and impact of expense reduction initiatives.
investments the company had total investments of $12,994,772 and $14,131,452 as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. net unrealized gains on the company's fixed maturity portfolio decreased $470,541 during 2015, from $1,215,074 at december 31, 2014 to $744,533 at december 31, 2015. this decrease was primarily due to an increase in treasury yields and an increase in credit spreads. for more information on the company's investments see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

net investment income decreased $30,212, or 5%, to $626,217 for twelve months 2015 from $656,429 for twelve months 2014. the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in invested assets as well as lower investment yields, partially offset by an increase of $5,747 in investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships.
net investment income increased $6,133, or 1%, to $656,429 for twelve months 2014 from $650,296 for twelve months 2013. the increase for the period was primarily related to $12,353 in additional investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships and $3,195 in additional investment income related to the loss recovery on certain mortgage-backed securities as a result of a trust settlement agreement. excluding the investment income from the real estate joint venture partnerships and the trust settlement agreement, net investment income decreased $9,415, primarily reflecting lower investment yields.
as of december 31, 2015, the company owned $170,552 of securities guaranteed by financial guarantee insurance companies. included in this amount was $158,274 of municipal securities, whose credit rating was a+ with the guarantee, but would have had a rating of a without the guarantee.

the company's investments in foreign government fixed maturity securities are held mainly in countries and currencies where the company has policyholder liabilities, which allow the assets and liabilities to be more appropriately matched. at december 31, 2015, approximately 79%, 8%, and 5% of the foreign government securities were held in the canadian government/provincials and the governments of brazil and germany, respectively. at december 31, 2014, approximately 76%, 10% and 5% of the foreign government securities were held in the canadian government/provincials and the governments of

brazil and germany, respectively. no other country represented more than 3% of the company's foreign government securities as of december 31, 2015 and 2014.
the company has european investment exposure in its corporate fixed maturity and equity securities of $888,923 with a net unrealized gain of $67,957 at december 31, 2015 and $1,060,655 with a net unrealized gain of $116,975 at december 31, 2014. approximately 25% and 22% of the corporate european exposure is held in the financial industry at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the company's largest european country exposure represented approximately 5% of the fair value of the company's corporate securities as of december 31, 2015 and 2014. approximately 6% of the fair value of the corporate european securities are pound and euro-denominated and are not hedged to u.s. dollars, but held to support those foreign-denominated liabilities. the company's international investments are managed as part of the overall portfolio with the same approach to risk management and focus on diversification.
the company has exposure to the energy sector in its corporate fixed maturity securities of $779,720 with a net unrealized loss of $6,985 at december 31, 2015 and $992,012 with a net unrealized gain of $89,590 at december 31, 2014. approximately 89% of the energy exposure is rated as investment grade as of december 31, 2015 and 2014.
the company has exposure to sub-prime and related mortgages within the company's fixed maturity security portfolio. at december 31, 2015, approximately 2% of the residential mortgage-backed holdings had exposure to sub-prime mortgage collateral. this represented less than 1% of the total fixed income portfolio and approximately 2% of the total unrealized gain position. of the securities with sub-prime exposure, approximately 9% are rated as investment grade. all residential mortgage-backed securities, including those with sub-prime exposure, are reviewed as part of the ongoing other-than-temporary impairment monitoring process.
as required by the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance, the company has identified and disclosed its financial assets in a fair value hierarchy, which consists of the following three levels:
•   level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company can access.
•   level 2 inputs utilize other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset. level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable in the marketplace for the asset. the observable inputs are used in valuation models to calculate the fair value for the asset.
•   level 3 inputs are unobservable but are significant to the fair value measurement for the asset, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset. these inputs reflect management's own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset.
the company reviews fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of levels for certain securities within the fair value hierarchy.
the company values level 2 securities using various observable market inputs obtained from a pricing service. the pricing service prepares estimates of fair value measurements for the company's level 2 securities using proprietary valuation models based on techniques such as matrix pricing which include observable market inputs. the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance defines observable market inputs as the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed on market data obtained from sources independent of the company. the extent of the use of each observable market input for a security depends on the type of security and the market conditions at the balance sheet date. depending on the security, the priority of the use of observable market inputs may change as some observable market inputs may not be relevant or additional inputs may be necessary. the company uses the following observable market inputs ("standard inputs"), listed in the approximate order of priority, in the pricing evaluation of level 2 securities: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data including market research data.
when market observable inputs are unavailable to the pricing service, the remaining unpriced securities are submitted to independent brokers who provide non-binding broker quotes or are priced by other qualified sources. if the company cannot corroborate the non-binding broker quotes with level 2 inputs, these securities are categorized as level 3.
a non-pricing service source prices certain privately placed corporate bonds using a model with observable inputs including, but not limited to, the credit rating, credit spreads, sector add-ons, and issuer specific add-ons. a non-pricing service source prices certain derivatives using a model with inputs including, but not limited to, the time to expiration, the notional amount, the strike price, the forward rate, implied volatility and the discount rate.
management evaluates the following factors in order to determine whether the market for a financial asset is inactive. the factors include, but are not limited to:
59
•   there are few recent transactions,
•   little information is released publicly,
•   the available prices vary significantly over time or among market participants,
•   the prices are stale (i.e., not current), and
•   the magnitude of the bid-ask spread.
illiquidity did not have a material impact in the fair value determination of the company's financial assets.
the company generally obtains one price for each financial asset. the company performs a monthly analysis to assess if the evaluated prices represent a reasonable estimate of their fair value. this process involves quantitative and qualitative analysis and is overseen by investment and accounting professionals. examples of procedures performed include, but are not limited to, initial and on-going review of pricing service methodologies, review of the prices received from the pricing service, review of pricing statistics and trends, and comparison of prices for certain securities with two different appropriate price sources for reasonableness. following this analysis, the company generally uses the best estimate of fair value based upon all available inputs. on infrequent occasions, a non-pricing service source may be more familiar with the market activity for a particular security than the pricing service. in these cases the price used is taken from the non-pricing service source. the pricing service provides information to indicate which securities were priced using market observable inputs so that the company can properly categorize the company's financial assets in the fair value hierarchy.
collateralized transactions as of december 31, 2015, the company has terminated its securities lending program and there are no outstanding transactions or balances.
in the past, the company lent fixed maturity securities, primarily bonds issued by the u.s. government and government agencies and authorities, and u.s. corporations, to selected broker/dealers. all such loans were negotiated on an overnight basis; term loans were not permitted. the company received collateral, greater than or equal to 102% of the fair value of the securities lent, plus accrued interest, in the form of cash and cash equivalents held by a custodian bank for the benefit of the company. the use of cash collateral received was unrestricted. the company reinvested the cash collateral received, generally in investments of high credit quality that are designated as available-for-sale. the company monitored the fair value of securities loaned and the collateral received, with additional collateral obtained, as necessary. the company was subject to the risk of loss on the re-investment of cash collateral.
as of december 31, 2014, the company's collateral held under securities lending agreements, of which its use was unrestricted, was $95,985, and is included in the consolidated balance sheets under the collateral held/pledged under securities agreements. the company's liability to the borrower for collateral received was $95,986, and is included in the consolidated balance sheets under the obligation under securities agreements. the difference between the collateral held and obligations under securities lending was recorded as an unrealized gain (loss) and included as part of aoci. the company included the available-for-sale investments purchased with the cash collateral in its evaluation of other-than-temporary impairments.
cash proceeds that the company received as collateral for the securities it lent and subsequent repayment of the cash were regarded by the company as cash flows from financing activities, since the cash received was considered a borrowing. since the company reinvested the cash collateral generally in investments that were designated as available-for-sale, the reinvestment is presented as cash flows from investing activities.
liquidity and capital resources regulatory requirements assurant, inc. is a holding company and, as such, has limited direct operations of its own. our holding company's assets consist primarily of the capital stock of our subsidiaries. accordingly, our holding company's future cash flows depend upon the availability of dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries, such as payments under our tax allocation agreement and under management agreements with our subsidiaries. the ability to pay such dividends and to make such other payments will be limited by applicable laws and regulations of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled, which subject our subsidiaries to significant regulatory restrictions. the dividend requirements and regulations vary from state to state and by type of insurance provided by the applicable subsidiary. these laws and regulations require, among other things, our insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends they can pay to the holding company. for further information on pending amendments to state insurance holding company laws, including the naic's "solvency modernization initiative," see "item 1a - risk factors - risks related to our industry - changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth." along with solvency regulations, the primary driver in
60
determining the amount of capital used for dividends is the level of capital needed to maintain desired financial strength ratings from a.m. best.
regulators or rating agencies could become more conservative in their methodology and criteria, increasing capital requirements for our insurance subsidiaries. this in turn, could negatively affect our capital resources. during 2015, the company announced that it will exit the health insurance market and has signed a definitive agreement to sell its assurant employee benefits segment. as a result of these announcements, the following actions were taken by the rating agencies:
a.m. best
•   ratings of union security insurance company and union security life insurance company of new york were placed under review with negative implications.
•   ratings of assurant's rated dental hmos were placed under review with positive implications.
•   ratings of john alden insurance company and time insurance company were downgraded from a- to b+.
•   ratings of assurant's senior debt were upgraded from bbb to bbb+.
•   ratings of assurant's commercial paper were upgraded from amb-2 to amb-1.
•   ratings of all other rated entities were affirmed with a stable outlook.
moody's investor services ("moody's")
•   rating of union security insurance company was affirmed and the outlook revised from developing to stable.
•   ratings of john alden life insurance company and time insurance company were downgraded from baa2 to ba1, and the outlook revised to negative.
•   ratings of assurant's senior debt (baa2), american security insurance company (a2), american bankers insurance company of florida (a2) and american bankers life assurance company of florida (a3) were affirmed with a stable outlook.
standard and poor's ("s&p")
•   union security insurance company (a-) was placed on creditwatch positive.
•   ratings of john alden life insurance company and time insurance company were downgraded from bbb to bb+, and the outlook revised to stable.
•   ratings of assurant's senior debt (bbb+), american bankers insurance company of florida (a), american bankers life assurance company of florida (a), american memorial life insurance company (a) and american security insurance company (a) were affirmed with a stable outlook.
no actions were taken on assurant's debt rating and other financial strength ratings by any of the agencies and these ratings remain unchanged. for further information on our ratings and the risks of ratings downgrades, see "item 1 - business" and "item 1a - risk factors - risks related to our company - a.m. best, moody's and s&p rate the financial strength of our insurance company subsidiaries, and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease."
for 2016, the maximum amount of dividends our u.s. domiciled insurance subsidiaries could pay, under applicable laws and regulations without prior regulatory approval, is approximately $564,000.
liquidity as of december 31, 2015, we had $462,248 in holding company capital. we use the term "holding company capital" to represent cash and other liquid marketable securities held at assurant, inc., out of a total of $601,819, that we are not otherwise holding for a specific purpose as of the balance sheet date, but can be used for stock repurchases, stockholder dividends, acquisitions, and other corporate purposes. $250,000 of the $462,248 of holding company capital is intended to serve as a buffer against remote risks (such as large-scale hurricanes). dividends or returns of capital paid by our subsidiaries, net of infusions and excluding amounts received from dispositions and amounts used for acquisitions, totaled $174,579, $453,485, and $607,295 for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. we use these cash inflows primarily to pay expenses, to make interest payments on indebtedness, to make dividend payments to our stockholders, to make subsidiary capital contributions, to fund acquisitions and to repurchase our outstanding shares.
in addition to paying expenses and making interest payments on indebtedness, our capital management strategy provides for several uses of the cash generated by our subsidiaries, including without limitation, returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, investing in our businesses to support growth in targeted areas, and making prudent and opportunistic acquisitions. during 2015, 2014 and 2013 we made share repurchases and paid dividends to our stockholders of $378,819, $295,765 and $472,308, respectively. we expect 2016 dividends from assurant solutions and assurant specialty
61
property to approximate their earnings, subject to the growth of the businesses, rating agency and regulatory capital requirements as well as investment performance. in addition, we expect the sale of assurant employee benefits to generate approximately $1,000,000 in net cash proceeds including capital releases and assurant health to contribute approximately $475,000, subject to ultimate development of claims, actual expenses needed to wind down operations, recoveries from affordable care act risk mitigation payments and regulatory approval.
the primary sources of funds for our subsidiaries consist of premiums and fees collected, proceeds from the sales and maturity of investments and net investment income. cash is primarily used to pay insurance claims, agent commissions, operating expenses and taxes. we generally invest our subsidiaries' excess funds in order to generate investment income.
we conduct periodic asset liability studies to measure the duration of our insurance liabilities, to develop optimal asset portfolio maturity structures for our significant lines of business and ultimately to assess that cash flows are sufficient to meet the timing of cash needs. these studies are conducted in accordance with formal company-wide asset liability management ("alm") guidelines.
to complete a study for a particular line of business, models are developed to project asset and liability cash flows and balance sheet items under a large, varied set of plausible economic scenarios. these models consider many factors including the current investment portfolio, the required capital for the related assets and liabilities, our tax position and projected cash flows from both existing and projected new business.
alternative asset portfolio structures are analyzed for significant lines of business. an investment portfolio maturity structure is then selected from these profiles given our return hurdle and risk preference. sensitivity testing of significant liability assumptions and new business projections is also performed.
our liabilities generally have limited policyholder optionality, which means that the timing of payments is relatively insensitive to the interest rate environment. in addition, our investment portfolio is largely comprised of highly liquid fixed maturity securities with a sufficient component of such securities invested that are near maturity which may be sold with minimal risk of loss to meet cash needs. therefore, we believe we have limited exposure to disintermediation risk.
generally, our subsidiaries' premiums, fees and investment income, along with planned asset sales and maturities, provide sufficient cash to pay claims and expenses. however, there may be instances when unexpected cash needs arise in excess of that available from usual operating sources. in such instances, we have several options to raise needed funds, including selling assets from the subsidiaries' investment portfolios, using holding company cash (if available), issuing commercial paper, or drawing funds from our revolving credit facility. in addition, we have filed an automatically effective shelf registration statement on form s-3 with the sec. this registration statement allows us to issue equity, debt or other types of securities through one or more methods of distribution. the terms of any offering would be established at the time of the offering, subject to market conditions. if we decide to make an offering of securities, we will consider the nature of the cash requirement as well as the cost of capital in determining what type of securities we may offer.
on january 15, 2016, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per common share payable on march 14, 2016 to stockholders of record as of february 29, 2016. we paid dividends of $0.50 per common share on december 14, 2015 to stockholders of record as of november 30, 2015. this represents a 67 percent increase above the quarterly dividend of $0.30 per common share paid on september 15, 2015 to stockholders of record as of august 31, 2015. we paid dividends of $0.30 per common share on june 9, 2015 to stockholders of record as of may 26, 2015. this represents an 11 percent increase above the quarterly dividend of $0.27 per common share paid on march 9, 2015 to stockholders of record as of february 23, 2015. any determination to pay future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon: our subsidiaries' payments of dividends and/or other statutorily permissible payments to us; our results of operations and cash flows; our financial position and capital requirements; general business conditions; legal, tax, regulatory and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends; and other factors our board of directors deems relevant.
on september 9, 2015, our board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $750,000 of its outstanding common stock. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we repurchased 4,184,889 shares of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $284,567, exclusive of commissions. as of december 31, 2015, $952,103 remained under the total repurchase authorization. the timing and the amount of future repurchases will depend on market conditions, our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors.
management believes the company will have sufficient liquidity to satisfy its needs over the next twelve months, including the ability to pay interest on our senior notes and dividends on our common shares.
retirement and other employee benefits we sponsor a qualified pension plan, (the "assurant pension plan") and various non-qualified pension plans (including an executive pension plan), along with a retirement health benefits plan covering our employees who meet specified eligibility requirements. the reported expense and liability associated with these plans requires an extensive use of assumptions which
62
include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases. we determine these assumptions based upon currently available market and industry data, and historical performance of the plan and its assets. the actuarial assumptions used in the calculation of our aggregate projected benefit obligation vary and include an expectation of long-term appreciation in equity markets which is not changed by minor short-term market fluctuations, but does change when large interim deviations occur. the assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants.
as of january 1, 2014, the assurant pension plan and executive pension plans are no longer offered to new hires. subsequently, effective january 1, 2016, the assurant pension plan was amended and split into two separate plans (plan no. 1 and plan no. 2). the new plan no. 2 will include a subset of the terminated vested population and the total in-payment population as of january 1, 2016. assets for both plans will remain in the assurant, inc. pension plan trust, however separate accounting entities will be maintained for plan no. 1 and plan no. 2.
effective march 1, 2016, the assurant pension plan and various non-qualified pension plans (including an executive pension plan) were frozen. no additional benefits will be earned after february 29, 2016.
the pension protection act of 2006 ("ppa") requires certain qualified plans, like the assurant pension plan, to meet specified funding thresholds. if these funding thresholds are not met, there are negative consequences to the assurant pension plan and participants. if the funded percentage falls below 80%, full payment of lump sum benefits as well as implementation of amendments improving benefits are restricted.
as of january 1, 2015, the assurant pension plan's funded percentage was 136% on a ppa calculated basis (based on an actuarial average value of assets compared to the funding target). therefore, benefit and payment restrictions did not occur during 2015. the 2015 funded measure will also be used to determine restrictions, if any, that can occur during the first nine months of 2016. due to the funding status of the assurant pension plan in 2015, no restrictions will exist before october 2016 (the time that the january 1, 2016 actuarial valuation needs to be completed). also, based on the estimated funded status as of january 1, 2016, we do not anticipate any restrictions on benefits for the remainder of 2016.
the assurant pension plan was under-funded by $51,973 and $28,956 (based on the fair value of the assets compared to the projected benefit obligation) on a gaap basis at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. this equates to an 94% and 97% funded status at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the change in funded status is mainly due to a decrease in the discount rate and a change in the mortality rates used to determine the projected benefit obligation.
the company's funding policy is to contribute amounts to the plan sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements in erisa, plus such additional amounts as the company may determine to be appropriate from time to time up to the maximum permitted. the funding policy considers several factors to determine such additional amounts including items such as the amount of service cost plus 15% of the assurant pension plan deficit and the capital position of the company. during 2015, we contributed $10,750 in cash to the assurant pension plan. due to the plan's current funding status, no cash is expected to be contributed to the assurant pension plan over the course of 2016. see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for the components of the net periodic benefit cost.
the impact of a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption on the 2016 projected benefit expense would result in a reduction of $600 for the assurant pension plan and the various non-qualified pension plans and a reduction of $100 on the retirement health benefit plan. the impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected return on assets assumption on the 2016 projected benefit expense would result in a change of $2,100 for the assurant pension plan and the various non-qualified pension plans and $100 for the retirement health benefits plan.
commercial paper program our commercial paper program requires us to maintain liquidity facilities either in an available amount equal to any outstanding notes from the program or in an amount sufficient to maintain the ratings assigned to the notes issued from the program. our commercial paper is rated amb-1 by a.m. best, p-2 by moody's and a-2 by s&p. our subsidiaries do not maintain commercial paper or other borrowing facilities. this program is currently backed up by a $400,000 senior revolving credit facility, of which $395,960 was available at december 31, 2015, due to $4,040 of outstanding letters of credit related to this program.
on september 16, 2014, we entered into a five-year unsecured $400,000 revolving credit agreement, as amended by amendment no. 1, dated as of march 5, 2015 ("2014 credit facility") with a syndicate of banks arranged by jp morgan chase bank, n.a. and wells fargo, n.a. the 2014 credit facility replaces our prior four-year $350,000 revolving credit facility ("2011 credit facility"), which was entered into on september 21, 2011 and was scheduled to expire in september 2015. the 2011 credit facility terminated upon the effectiveness of the 2014 credit facility. the 2014 credit facility provides for revolving loans and the issuance of multi-bank, syndicated letters of credit and/or letters of credit from a sole issuing bank in an aggregate amount of $400,000 and is available until september 2019, provided we are in compliance with all covenants. the 2014 credit facility has a sublimit for letters of credit issued thereunder of $50,000. the proceeds of these loans may be used
63
for our commercial paper program or for general corporate purposes. the company may increase the total amount available under the 2014 credit facility to $525,000 subject to certain conditions. no bank is obligated to provide commitments above their current share of the $400,000 facility.
we did not use the commercial paper program during the twelve months ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 and there were no amounts relating to the commercial paper program outstanding at december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014. the company made no borrowings using the 2014 credit facility and no loans were outstanding at december 31, 2015.
the 2014 credit facility contains restrictive covenants, all of which were met as of december 31, 2015. these covenants include (but are not limited to):
(i)   maintenance of a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio on the last day of any fiscal quarter of not greater than 35%, and
(ii)   maintenance of a consolidated adjusted net worth in an amount not less than the "minimum amount". for the purpose of this calculation the "minimum amount" is an amount equal to the sum of (a) the base amount $3,317,000 plus (b) 25% of consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter (if positive) ending after june 30, 2014, plus (c) 25% of the net proceeds received by the company from any capital contribution to, or issuance of any capital stock or hybrid securities received after june 30, 2014.
at december 31, 2015, our ratio of debt to total capitalization as calculated under the covenant was 21%, the consolidated minimum amount described in (ii) above was $3,404,584 and our actual consolidated adjusted net worth as calculated under the covenant was $4,558,404.
in the event of the breach of certain covenants all obligations under the 2014 credit facility, including unpaid principal and accrued interest and outstanding letters of credit, may become immediately due and payable.
senior notes on march 28, 2013, we issued two series of senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $700,000 (the "2013 senior notes"). the first series is $350,000 in principal amount, bears interest at 2.50% per year and is payable in a single installment due march 15, 2018. the second series is $350,000 in principal amount, bears interest at 4.00% per year and is payable in a single installment due march 15, 2023.
the net proceeds from the sale of the 2013 senior notes were $698,093, which represents the principal amount less the discount before offering expenses. the company used the net proceeds of the 2013 senior notes for general corporate purposes, including to repay $500,000 of debt that matured in february 2014.
interest on our 2013 senior notes is payable semi-annually on march 15 and september 15 of each year. the interest expense incurred related to the 2013 senior notes was $22,988, $22,981 and $17,357 for the twelve months ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. there was $6,635 of accrued interest at both december 31, 2015 and 2014. the 2013 senior notes are unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of the company's other senior unsecured indebtedness. the company may redeem each series of the 2013 senior notes in whole or in part at any time and from time to time before their maturity at the redemption price set forth in the indenture.
in addition, during 2014, we had two series of senior notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of $975,000 (the "2004 senior notes"). the first series was $500,000 in principal amount, bore interest at 5.63% per year and was repaid on february 18, 2014. the second series is $475,000 in principal amount, bears interest at 6.75% per year and is due february 15, 2034.
interest on our 2004 senior notes is payable semi-annually on february 15 and august 15 of each year. the interest expense incurred related to the 2004 senior notes was $32,127, $35,414 and $59,414 for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. there was $12,023 of accrued interest at both december 31, 2015 and 2014. the 2004 senior notes are unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness. the 2004 senior notes are not redeemable prior to maturity.
in management's opinion, dividends from our subsidiaries together with our income and gains from our investment portfolio will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our needs in the ordinary course of business.
cash flows we monitor cash flows at the consolidated, holding company and subsidiary levels. cash flow forecasts at the consolidated and subsidiary levels are provided on a monthly basis, and we use trend and variance analyses to project future cash needs making adjustments to the forecasts when needed.

cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013
operating activities:
we typically generate operating cash inflows from premiums collected from our insurance products and income received from our investments while outflows consist of policy acquisition costs, benefits paid, and operating expenses. these net cash flows are then invested to support the obligations of our insurance products and required capital supporting these products. our cash flows from operating activities are affected by the timing of premiums, fees, and investment income received and expenses paid.
net cash provided by operating activities was $192,483 and $313,782 for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in the timing of payments and higher payments made on 2015 individual major medical policies.
net cash provided by operating activities was $313,782 and $1,003,819 for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in the timing of payments and by amounts yet to be recovered under the 3r's program, partially offset by increased net written premiums in assurant solutions, assurant health and assurant employee benefits. for more information on the 3r's, please refer to assurant health's results of operations section in this item 7.

net cash provided by investing activities was $264,293 and $63,889 for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the change in investing activities is primarily due to higher sales of fixed maturity securities, less cash spent on acquisitions and equity interests and the sale of aric to global indemnity group inc. during 2015. for more information on the aric sale, please see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. these increases are partially offset by changes in our short-term investments and an increase of purchases of fixed maturity securities.

net cash used in financing activities was $487,127 and $776,199 for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the change in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the first quarter 2014 repayment of $467,330 of senior debt, which represents $500,000 in principal less amounts repurchased in 2013, and the payment of a contingent liability related to the acquisition of lsg during first quarter 2014.

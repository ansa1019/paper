item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations managements discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, which include additional information about our accounting policies, practices and the transactions underlying our financial results. the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (u.s. gaap) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business. we apply our best judgment, our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements. we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ from these estimates. ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as ball corporation, ball, the company or we or our in the following discussion and analysis.
overview business overview and industry trends ball corporation is one of the worlds leading suppliers of metal packaging to the beverage, food, personal care and household products industries. our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses, are manufactured in facilities around the world and are competitive with other substrates, such as plastics and glass. in the rigid packaging industry, sales and earnings can be increased by reducing costs, increasing prices, developing new products, expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions. we also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers.
we sell our packaging products mainly to large, multinational beverage, food, personal care and household products companies with which we have developed long-term customer relationships. this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long-term supply contracts. while we have a diversified customer base, we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in north america, europe, asia and south america, as do our equity joint ventures in the u.s. and vietnam. the overall metal container industry is growing globally and is expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term despite the north american industry seeing a continued decline in standard-sized aluminum beverage packaging for the carbonated soft drink market. the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are u.s. government agencies or their prime contractors.
we purchase our raw materials from relatively few suppliers. we also have exposure to inflation, in particular the rising costs of raw materials, as well as other direct cost inputs. we mitigate our exposure to the changes in the costs of metal through the inclusion of provisions in contracts covering the majority of our volumes to pass through metal price changes, as well as through the use of derivative instruments. the pass-through provisions generally result in proportional increases or decreases in sales and costs with a greatly reduced impact, if any, on net earnings. because of our customer and supplier concentration, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss, insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier, although our contract provisions generally mitigate the risk of customer loss, and our long-term relationships represent a known, stable customer base.
we recognize sales under long-term contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using percentage-of-completion under the cost-to-cost method of accounting. throughout the period of contract performance, we regularly reevaluate and, if necessary, revise our estimates of aerospace and technologies total contract revenue, total contract cost and progress toward completion. because of contract payment schedules, limitations on funding and other contract terms, our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed.

corporate strategy our drive for 10 vision encompasses five strategic levers that are key to growing our business and achieving long-term success. since launching drive for 10 in 2011, we made progress on each of the levers as follows:
·                  maximizing value in our existing businesses by rationalizing standard beverage container and end capacity in north america and expanding specialty container production to meet current demand; leveraging plant floor systems in our metal beverage facilities to improve efficiencies and reduce costs; consolidating and/or closing multiple metal beverage and metal food and aerosol packaging facilities to gain business, customer and supplier efficiencies; and implementing cost-out and value-in initiatives across all of our businesses;
·                  expanding further into new products and capabilities by expanding into extruded aluminum aerosol manufacturing with the installation of a new extruded aluminum aerosol line in our deforest, wisconsin, facility during 2014; the acquisition of sonocos metal end and closure manufacturing facilities in canton, ohio, in february 2015; the installation of new extruded aluminum aerosol lines in our devizes, united kingdom and czech republic facilities; and successfully commercializing extruded aluminum aerosol packaging that utilizes a significant amount of recycled material;
·                  aligning ourselves with the right customers and markets by investing capital to meet double-digit volume growth for specialty beverage containers throughout our global network, which now represent approximately 29 percent of our global beverage packaging mix; successfully commercialized the next generation aluminum bottle-shaping technology in conroe, texas, for a customer under a long-term arrangement; and the construction of a metal beverage container facility in monterrey, mexico, producing cans and ends;
·                  broadening our geographic reach with new investments in a metal beverage manufacturing facility in myanmar, as well as an extruded aluminum aerosol manufacturing facility in india, and the construction of a metal beverage container facility in monterrey, mexico, producing cans and ends; and
·                  leveraging our technological expertise in packaging innovation, including the introduction of next-generation aluminum bottle-shaping technologies, including the introduction of a new two piece, lightweight steel aerosol can, g3, technology in our chestnut hill, tennessee, facility in december 2015; and pursuing opportunities to further enhance our aerospace technical expertise across a broader customer portfolio.
these ongoing business developments help us stay close to our customers while expanding and/or sustaining our industry positions with major beverage, food, personal care, household products and aerospace customers.

the decrease in net sales in 2015 compared to 2014 was due to unfavorable foreign currency effects in europe, lower metal food container sales volumes due to a customer shift in north american steel food containers and unfavorable pricing in the prc, partially offset by higher beverage segment sales volumes.  net earnings were lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower sales, unfavorable currency effects, higher business consolidation and other activities and higher debt refinancing and other costs, partially offset by a lower tax rate in 2015 and cost reduction efforts by all business segments.
the increased business consolidation and other activities in 2015 compared to 2014 included collar and option contract losses, cross-currency swap fair value changes, net currency exchange losses on the restricted cash and debt associated with the proposed rexam acquisition, and transaction costs related to the proposed acquisition of rexam.  the collar and option contracts, as well as the cross-currency swap, are not accounted for as hedges. see note 5 and 19 located in item 8 of this annual report for additional information on financial instruments.
the increased debt refinancing and other costs in 2015 compared to 2014 included mark to market losses on derivative
24
financial instruments designed to mitigate exposure to interest rates changes for debt issuances related to the proposed rexam acquisition, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing charges for the partial extinguishment of the committed bridge loan agreement and the revolving credit facility, interest expense on newly issued 3.5 percent and 4.375 percent senior notes planned to fund a portion of the purchase price of the proposed rexam acquisition, amortization of deferred financing costs for the committed bridge loan agreement and the redemption of the 6.75 percent and 5.75 percent senior notes. see note 13 and 19 located in item 8 of this annual report for additional information on financial instruments.
the increase in net sales in 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to higher metal beverage container sales volumes and higher aerospace program revenues, partially offset by lower north american food and household product volumes. net earnings were favorably impacted by higher metal beverage container sales volumes, lower cost of sales as a percentage of net sales, lower depreciation expense, lower interest expense and a lower tax rate in 2014, partially offset by lower north american food and household product volumes, unfavorable tinplate service center manufacturing performance in the u.s., higher debt refinancing costs and higher selling, general and administrative costs in 2014.
cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization)
cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, was $6,460.3 million in 2015 compared to $6,903.5 million in 2014 and $6,875.4 million in 2013. these amounts represented 80.8 percent, 80.6 percent and 81.2 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years, respectively.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was $285.5 million in 2015 compared to $280.9 million in 2014 and $299.9 million in 2013. these amounts represented 3.6 percent, 3.3 percent and 3.5 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years, respectively. lower expense in 2014 compared to 2013 was largely due to the completion of depreciation for certain acquired european assets.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses were $451.3 million in 2015 compared to $466.5 million in 2014 and $418.6 million in 2013. these amounts represented 5.6 percent, 5.4 percent and 4.9 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years, respectively. the decrease in sg&a expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower incentive compensation and net favorable foreign currency effects in sg&a, partially offset by deferred compensation expense related to director retirements.  the increase in sg&a in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher incentive compensation and employee benefit costs and other individually insignificant higher costs.
interest expense total interest expense was $259.7 million in 2015 compared to $193.0 million in 2014 and $211.8 million in 2013. excluding debt refinancing and other costs, interest expense in 2015 was lower compared to 2014 due to lower interest rates on newly issued long-term debt and the retirement of higher interest rate long-term debt. excluding debt refinancing and other costs, interest expense in 2014 was lower than in 2013 due primarily to lower average debt levels and lower average borrowing rates. interest expense, excluding the effect of debt refinancing costs, as a percentage of average monthly borrowings was 4.3 percent in 2015, 4.8 percent in 2014 and 5.1 percent in 2013.
debt refinancing and other costs were $116.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2015.  these costs consisted of (1) fair value changes on derivative instruments designed to mitigate risks of interest rate changes with anticipated debt issuances for a portion of the cash consideration payable in the proposed acquisition of rexam, (2) the amortization of deferred financing fees on the unsecured, committed bridge loan agreement, (3) write-offs of unamortized deferred financing fees and the premium paid for the redemption of previously issued senior credit facilities, the partial extinguishment of the committed bridge loan agreement, and the partial extinguishment of the revolving credit facility, (4) the refinance of senior credit facilities, and (5) interest expense on senior notes issued in december 2015 to fund a portion of the cash consideration of the proposed rexam acquisition.  see note 19 in item 8 of this annual report for additional information on these instruments and the transactions flowing through debt refinancing and other costs.

tax provision the effective income tax rate for earnings from continuing operations was 13.6 percent in 2015 compared to 23.2 percent in 2014 and 25.6 percent in 2013. the lower tax rate in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to business consolidation costs incurred in the u.s., lower u.s. taxes on foreign earnings, and increased research and development tax credits, partially offset by decreased favorable nonrecurring discrete tax items in the 2015 effective tax rate. the lower tax rate in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily the result of a higher foreign tax rate differential, lower u.s. taxes on foreign earnings, and the 2014 releases of uncertain tax positions which exceeded those occurring in 2013.

the metal beverage packaging, americas and asia, segment consists of operations located in the u.s., canada, brazil and the prc, which manufacture aluminum containers used in beverage packaging.
in april 2015, we announced the construction of a metal beverage manufacturing facility in monterrey, mexico, which began production of cans and ends in january 2016. during the first quarter of 2015, we announced the introduction of a next-generation aluminum bottle-shaping technology in our conroe, texas, facility. additionally, in may 2014, we announced the expansion of our asian operations with the construction of a new beverage can manufacturing facility in myanmar, which is expected to begin production in the first half of 2016.
segment sales in 2015 were relatively unchanged from 2014 as higher sales volumes in the americas and the prc were offset by unfavorable pricing in the prc. segment earnings in 2015 were $23.9 million lower compared to 2014 due primarily to unfavorable pricing in the prc.
segment sales in 2014 were $53.4 million higher compared to 2013 due primarily to $101 million higher sales volumes, offset by a reduction in the pass through price of aluminum. segment earnings in 2014 were $22.4 million higher than in 2013 due to $36 million from higher sales volumes, partially offset by higher incentive compensation and other individually insignificant costs.
the current industry supply of metal beverage packaging exceeds demand in the prc, resulting in pricing pressure and negative impacts on the profitability of our beverage asia reporting unit. if it becomes an expectation that this market oversupply situation will continue for an extended period of time, the company may be required to record a noncash impairment charge for some or all of the goodwill associated with the beverage asia reporting unit, the total balance of which was $78.3 million at december 31, 2015.

the aerospace and technologies segment consists of the manufacture and sale of aerospace and other related products and services provided for the defense, civil space and commercial space industries.
segment sales in 2015 decreased $124.7 million compared to 2014 primarily due to lower sales from u.s. national defense contracts. segment earnings in 2015 decreased $11.8 million compared to 2014 due to lower sales, favorable program performance in 2014 from program and contract completions and increased recovery of pension costs in 2014.
segment sales in 2014 increased $37.7 million compared to 2013 due to higher sales for civil space contracts and u.s. national defense contracts. segment earnings in 2014 increased $13.5 million primarily as a result of favorable program execution and increased recovery of pension costs.
sales to the u.s. government, either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor, represented 96 percent of segment sales in 2015 compared to 95 percent of segment sales in 2014 and 94 percent in 2013. the aerospace and technologies contract mix in 2015 consisted of 54 percent cost-type contracts, which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon and/or earned profit component, and 43 percent fixed-price contracts.
contracted backlog for the aerospace and technologies segment at december 31, 2015 and 2014, was $617 million and $765 million, respectively. the year-over-year decline reflects the successful completion of several multi-year contracts. the segment has numerous outstanding bids for future contract awards. comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts, funding of programs and the uncertainty of timing of future contract awards.
additional segment information for additional information regarding our segments, see the business segment information in note 3 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report. the charges recorded for business consolidation and other activities were based on estimates by ball management and were developed from information available at the time. if actual outcomes vary from the estimates, the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation gains and losses. additional details about our business consolidation and other activities are provided in note 5 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report.

financial condition, liquidity and capital resources cash flows and capital expenditures our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external committed borrowings. we believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by short-term, long-term and committed revolver borrowings, when necessary, will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, dividend payments, proposed acquisitions, including the announced, proposed acquisition of rexam, and anticipated capital expenditures. the following summarizes our cash flows:
years ended december 31,

($ in millions)                                         2015              2014                2013
cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities          $1,006.7            $1,012.5            $839.0
cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities          (2,720.7   )          (391.4   )        (379.1   )
cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities           1,737.2              (845.3   )        (204.0   )
cash flows from operations in 2015 were comparable to 2014 as lower pension contributions were offset by lower net earnings, lower cash inflows from working capital and cash paid for transaction costs for the proposed acquisition of rexam. the working capital changes were primarily related to slightly higher days sales outstanding, partially offset by lower inventory volumes and higher days payable outstanding. days sales outstanding increased from 34 days to 35 days, inventory days on hand decreased from 52 days to 49 days and days payable outstanding increased from 69 days to 82 days. the increase in days payables outstanding is primarily due to renegotiation of payment terms in supplier contracts in north america.
cash flows from operations in 2014 improved compared to 2013 due to higher net earnings and favorable working capital changes. the favorable working capital changes were primarily related to lower days sales outstanding, lower inventory days on hand and higher days payable outstanding. days sales outstanding decreased from 36 days to 34 days due to greater factoring of accounts receivables. inventory days on hand decreased from 53 days to 52 days. due to the negotiation of longer payment terms with suppliers, days payable outstanding increased from 51 days to 69 days.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, the company entered into collar and option contracts to reduce exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with the british pound denominated cash portion of the proposed acquisition of rexam.  the amount of the gain or loss ultimately realized on these contracts and the resulting cash settlement is expected to be offset by the changes in the amount of cash consideration paid to acquire rexam.
we have entered into several regional committed and uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs with various financial institutions for certain accounts receivables of the company. the programs are accounted for as true sales of the receivables, without recourse to ball, and had combined limits of approximately $600 million at december 31, 2015. a total of $478.7 million and $197.6 million were sold under these programs as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
annual cash dividends paid on common stock were 52 cents per share in 2015, 2014 and 2013. total dividends paid were $71.8 million in 2015, $72.7 million in 2014 and $75.2 million in 2013. we also paid dividends to noncontrolling interests of $17.9 million in 2015, $12.2 million in 2014 and $12.9 million in 2013.
as of december 31, 2015, approximately $219 million of our cash was held outside of the u.s. there are no material legal or other economic restrictions regarding the repatriation of cash from any of the countries outside the u.s. where we have cash. the company believes its u.s. operating cash flows; the $2.2 billion available under the companys long-term, revolving credit facility; the $452 million available under other u.s.-based uncommitted short-term credit facilities; availability under u.s.-based committed and uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs; and availability under the u.s.-based accounts receivable securitization program will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of the u.s. portion of the companys ongoing operations, scheduled principal and interest payments on u.s. debt, dividend payments, capital expenditures and other u.s. cash requirements. if foreign funds are needed for our u.s. cash requirements, we will be required to accrue and pay u.s. taxes, net of applicable foreign tax credits, to repatriate funds from foreign locations where the company has previously asserted indefinite reinvestment of funds outside the u.s. however, it continues to be the companys intent to permanently reinvest these foreign amounts outside the u.s., and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the foreign amounts to fund our u.s. cash requirements.

due to the u.s. tax status of certain of balls subsidiaries in canada and the prc, the company annually provides u.s. taxes on foreign earnings in those subsidiaries, net of any estimated foreign tax credits. current taxes are also provided on certain other undistributed earnings that are currently taxed in the u.s. net u.s. taxes provided for brazil, canada and prc earnings in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $1.7 million, $11.8 million and $26.4 million, respectively. managements intention is to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of balls remaining foreign investments and, as a result, no u.s. income or federal withholding tax provision has been made. the indefinite reinvestment assertion is supported by both long-term and short-term forecasts and u.s. financial requirements, including, but not limited to, operating cash flows, capital expenditures, debt maturities and dividends. the company has not provided deferred taxes on earnings in certain non-u.s. subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in its international operations. retained earnings in non-u.s. subsidiaries were $2,021.7 million as of december 31, 2015. it is not practical to estimate the additional taxes that may become payable for the portion of these foreign earnings that have not already been taxed in the u.s.; however, repatriation of these earnings could result in a material increase in the companys income tax liabilities.
share repurchases the companys share repurchases, net of issuances, totaled $99.5 million in 2015, $360.1 million in 2014 and $398.8 million in 2013. the repurchases were completed using cash on hand and available borrowings and included accelerated share repurchase agreements and other purchases under our ongoing share repurchase program. additional details about our share repurchase activities are provided in note 16 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report.
debt facilities and refinancing given our cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until 2018, our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing cash and debt service requirements. total interest-bearing debt was $5.1 billion at december 31, 2015, compared to $3.2 billion at december 31, 2014.
on february 19, 2015, the company entered into a £3.3 billion unsecured bridge loan agreement, pursuant to which lending institutions agreed, subject to limited conditions, to provide financing necessary to pay the cash portion of the consideration payable to rexam shareholders upon consummation of the proposed acquisition of rexam and related fees and expenses.  in december 2015, the company issued $1 billion of 4.375 percent senior notes and 400 million of 3.5 percent senior notes, all due in december 2020, and 700 million of 4.375 percent senior notes, due in december 2023. pursuant to the terms of the unsecured bridge loan agreement, the company deposited the net proceeds from the issuance of such notes into an escrow account (from which proceeds would be released, subject to certain conditions, to pay a portion of the cash consideration payable to rexam shareholders and related fees and expenses), which reduced the commitments under the bridge loan agreement availability to £1.9 billion. this reduction in the unsecured bridge loan resulted in the write-off of $10.7 million of related deferred financing costs. see note 13 for further details related to these transactions.  in the event that the rexam acquisition is not consummated on or prior to november 15, 2016, these senior notes would be callable by the lender, requiring the company to effect the redemption of all of the outstanding notes of each series at the applicable redemption price. this would result in the use of restricted cash and other available funds to redeem these senior notes and pay any additional fees.
on february 19, 2015, the company entered into a new $3 billion revolving credit facility to replace the existing approximate $1 billion bank credit facility, redeem the 2020 and 2021 senior notes and provide ongoing liquidity for the company. in june 2015, ball issued $1 billion of 5.25 percent senior notes due in july 2025. ball used the net proceeds of the offering and other available cash to repay borrowings under its revolving credit facility and reduced the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility from $3 billion to $2.25 billion. in connection with this partial extinguishment, the company recorded a charge of $5.0 million, which is included in debt refinancing and other costs, a component of total interest expense, in the consolidated statements of earnings.
in addition, on february 19, 2015, the company announced the redemption of all of the outstanding 6.75 percent senior notes due in september 2020 and all of the 5.75 percent senior notes due in may 2021, each in the amount of $500 million. the redemption of these bonds occurred in march 2015, and resulted in a pre-tax charge of $55.8 million, composed of the redemption premiums and the write-offs of related debt financing costs in debt refinancing and other costs.
on december 9, 2013, we announced the redemption of our outstanding 7.375 percent senior notes due in september 2019 in the amount of $315.4 million. the redemption occurred on january 10, 2014, at a price per note of 108.01 percent of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest. the redemption of the bonds resulted in a pretax charge in the first quarter of 2014 of $33.1 million for the call premium and the write-off of unamortized financing costs, which is included in debt refinancing and other costs, a component of total interest expense, in the consolidated statements of earnings.
in june 2013, we amended the senior credit facilities and extended the term from december 2015 to june 2018. in connection with the amendment, we recorded a charge of $0.4 million for the write-off of unamortized financing costs, which is included in debt refinancing and other costs, a component of total interest expense, in the consolidated statements of earnings.
30
in may 2013, we: (1) issued $1 billion of 4.00 percent senior notes due in november 2023; (2) tendered for the redemption of our 7.125 percent senior notes originally due in september 2016 in the amount of $375 million, at a redemption price per note of 105.322 percent of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest; and (3) repaid the $125 million term a loan, which was a component of the senior credit facilities. the redemption of the senior notes and the early repayment of the term a loan resulted in charges of $26.5 million for the tender and call premiums, as well as the write-off of unamortized financing costs and issuance discounts, which is included in debt refinancing and other costs, a component of total interest expense, in the consolidated statements of earnings.
short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt on the balance sheet includes any borrowings under the existing accounts receivable securitization agreement, of which no amounts were outstanding at december 31, 2015. this agreement, which has been amended and extended from time to time, is scheduled to mature in may 2017 and allows the company to borrow against a maximum amount of accounts receivable that varies between $90 million and $140 million depending on the seasonal accounts receivable balances in the companys north american packaging businesses.
at december 31, 2015, taking into account outstanding credit and excluding availability under the accounts receivable securitization program, approximately $2.2 billion was available under the companys long-term, multi-currency committed revolving credit facilities. in addition to these facilities, the company had approximately $452 million of short-term uncommitted credit facilities available at the end of 2015, of which $23.7 million was outstanding and due on demand. the company has additional availability of $2.8 billion (£1.9 billion) through the unsecured, committed bridge loan agreement. of the amounts available under the credit facilities described above of approximately $5.5 billion, we will be required to repay certain of rexams debt obligations and to settle rexams outstanding derivatives. our best estimate based on the latest issued financials for rexam is that this will be $1.4 billion.
while ongoing financial and economic conditions raise concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions, the company mitigates its exposure by allocating the risk among various counterparties and limiting exposure to any one party. we also monitor the credit ratings of our suppliers, customers, lenders and counterparties on a regular basis.
we were in compliance with all loan agreements at december 31, 2015, and all prior years presented, and have met all debt payment obligations. the u.s. note agreements and bank credit agreement contain certain restrictions relating to dividends, investments, financial ratios, guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. additional details about our debt and receivables sales agreements are available in note 6 and note 13, accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report.
other liquidity measures management performance measures management internally uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as return on average invested capital (net operating earnings after tax over the relevant performance period divided by average invested capital over the same period); economic value added (eva®) dollars (net operating earnings after tax less a capital charge on average invested capital employed); earnings before interest and taxes (ebit); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda); diluted earnings per share; cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow (generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures). we believe this information is also useful to investors as it provides insight into the earnings and cash flow criteria management uses to make strategic decisions. these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on acquisitions and dispositions.
nonfinancial measures in the packaging businesses include production efficiency and spoilage rates; quality control figures; environmental, health and safety statistics; production and sales volumes; asset utilization rates; and measures of sustainability. additional measures used to evaluate financial performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization, award and incentive fees realized, proposal win rates and backlog (including awarded, contracted and funded backlog).

the following financial measurements are on a non-u.s. gaap basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report. non-u.s. gaap measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap. a presentation of earnings in accordance with u.s. gaap is available in item 8 of this annual report.

based on information currently available, we estimate cash flows from operating activities including cash transaction costs for the proposed acquisition of rexam, for 2016 to be in the range of $900 million, capital expenditures to be approximately $400 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $500 million. in 2016, we intend to utilize our operating cash flow to fund our stock repurchases, dividend payments, growth capital projects and, to the extent available, acquisitions that meet our various criteria. of the total 2016 estimated capital expenditures, approximately $150 million was contractually committed as of december 31, 2015.

(c)          the companys purchase obligations include capital expenditures and contracted amounts for aluminum, steel and other direct materials. also included are commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity, expenses related to aerospace and technologies contracts and other less significant items. in cases where variable prices and/or usage are involved, managements best estimates have been used. depending on the circumstances, early termination of the contracts may or may not result in penalties and, therefore, actual payments could vary significantly.
the table above does not include $50.5 million of uncertain tax positions, the timing of which is unknown at this time.
contributions to the companys defined benefit pension plans, not including the unfunded german plans, are expected to be $31 million in 2016. this estimate may change based on changes in the pension protection act and actual plan asset performance and available company cash flow, among other factors. benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be $94.1 million, $97.4 million, $100.9 million, $104.5 million and $108.6 million for the years ending december 31, 2016 through 2020, respectively, and a total of $584 million for the years 2021 through 2025. payments to participants in the unfunded german plans are expected to be between $16 million and $18 million in each of the years 2016 through 2020 and a total of $75 million for the years 2021 through 2025.
based on changes in return on asset and discount rate assumptions, as well as revisions based on plan experience studies, total pension expense in 2016 is anticipated to be approximately $6 million lower than in 2015, excluding curtailment expenses. a reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in an estimated $3.4 million increase in the 2016 pension expense, while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated $4.8 million of additional pension expense in 2016. additional information regarding the companys pension plans is provided in note 15 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report.

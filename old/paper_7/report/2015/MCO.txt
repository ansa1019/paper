item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the moodys corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
this md&a contains forward-looking statements. see forward-looking statements commencing on page 56 and item 1a. risk factors commencing on page 17 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements.
the company moodys is a provider of (i) credit ratings, (ii) credit, capital markets and economic related research, data and analytical tools, (iii) software solutions and related risk management services, (iv) quantitative credit risk measures, financial services training and certification services and (v) outsourced research and analytical services. moodys has two reportable segments: mis and ma.
mis, the credit rating agency, publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide. revenue is primarily derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use mis ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors. additionally, mis earns revenue from certain non-ratings-related operations which consist primarily of the distribution of research and financial instruments pricing services in the asia-pacific region as well as revenue from icras non-ratings operations. the revenue from these operations is included in the mis other lob and is not material to the results of the mis segment.
the ma segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets. within its rd&a business, ma distributes research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process, including in-depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies and commentary on topical credit-related events. the rd&a business also produces economic research as well as data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores. within its ers business, ma provides software solutions as well as related risk management services. the ps business provides outsourced research and analytical services and financial training and certification programs.
critical accounting estimates moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. on an ongoing basis, moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other retirement benefits, utps and stock-based compensation. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on managements judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or the services have been provided and accepted by the customer when applicable, fees are determinable and the collection of resulting receivables is considered probable.
pursuant to the guidance of asc topic 605, when a sales arrangement contains multiple deliverables, the company allocates revenue to each deliverable based on its relative selling price which is determined based on its vendor specific objective evidence if available, third party evidence if vsoe is not available, or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available.
the companys products and services will generally qualify as separate units of accounting under asc topic 605. the company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value to the customers and if the arrangement includes a customer refund or return right relative to the delivered item, the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the companys control. in instances where the aforementioned criteria are not met, the delivered item is combined with the undelivered items and revenue recognition is determined as one single unit.
the company determines whether its selling price in a multi-element transaction meets the vsoe criteria by using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately or, if the deliverable is not yet being sold separately, the price established by management having
28   moodys 2015 10k the relevant authority to establish such a price. in instances where the company is not able to establish vsoe for all deliverables in a multiple element arrangement, which may be due to the company infrequently selling each element separately, not selling products within a reasonably narrow price range, or only having a limited sales history, the company attempts to establish tpe for deliverables. the company determines whether tpe exists by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. however, due to the difficulty in obtaining third party pricing, possible differences in the companys market strategy from that of its peers and the potential that products and services offered by the company may contain a significant level of differentiation and/or customization such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained, the company generally is unable to reliably determine tpe. based on the selling price hierarchy established by asu 2009-13, when the company is unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe, the company will establish an esp. esp is the price at which the company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. the company establishes its best estimate of esp considering internal factors relevant to its pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives, standalone sales prices of similar products, percentage of the fee charged for a primary product or service relative to a related product or service, and customer segment and geography. additional consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and market trend. the company reviews its determination of vsoe, tpe and esp on an annual basis or more frequently as needed.
in the mis segment, revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is recognized when the rating is issued. revenue attributed to monitoring of issuers or issued securities is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed, generally one year. in the case of commercial mortgage-backed securities, structured credit, international residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, issuers can elect to pay all future monitoring fees upfront. these fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods based on the expected lives of the rated securities, which was approximately 27 years on a weighted average basis at december 31, 2015. at december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately $121 million, $107 million and $97 million, respectively.
multiple element revenue arrangements in the mis segment are generally comprised of an initial rating and the related monitoring service. in instances where monitoring fees are not charged for the first year monitoring effort, fees are allocated to the initial rating and monitoring services based on the relative selling price of each service to the total arrangement fees. the company generally uses esp in determining the selling price for its initial ratings as the company rarely sells initial ratings separately without providing related monitoring services and thus is unable to establish vsoe or tpe for initial ratings.
mis estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available. the estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data. at december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, accounts receivable included approximately $24 million, $22 million and $21 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. historically, mis has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. furthermore, for certain annual monitoring services, fees are not invoiced until the end of the monitoring period, however, revenue is recognized ratably over the monitoring period. at december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, accounts receivable included approximately $146.4 million, $127.8 million and $96.7 million, respectively, relating to accrued monitoring service revenue.
in the ma segment, products and services offered by the company include software licenses and related maintenance, subscriptions, and professional services. revenue from subscription based products, such as research and data subscriptions and certain software-based credit risk management subscription products, is recognized ratably over the related subscription period, which is principally one year. revenue from sale of perpetual licenses of credit processing software is generally recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to and accepted by the customer. software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the annual maintenance period. revenue from professional services rendered is generally recognized as the services are performed. if uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the product or service, revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs. a large portion of annual research and data subscriptions as well as annual software maintenance is invoiced in november, december and january of each year.
products and services offered within the ma segment are sold either stand-alone or together in various combinations. in instances where a multiple element arrangement includes software and non-software deliverables, revenue is allocated to the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables, as a group, using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. revenue is recognized for each element based upon the conditions for revenue recognition previously described.
if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is allocated to each software deliverable using vsoe. in the instances where the company is not able to determine vsoe for all of the deliverables of an arrangement, the company allocates the revenue to the undelivered elements equal to its vsoe and the residual revenue to the delivered elements. if the company is unable to determine vsoe for an undelivered element, the company defers all revenue allocated to the software deliverables until the company has delivered all of the elements or when vsoe has been determined for the undelivered elements. in cases where software implementation services are considered essential and vsoe of fair moodys 2015 10k   29
value exists for post-contract customer support (pcs), once the delivery criteria have been met on the standard software, license and service revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis as implementation services are performed, while pcs is recognized over the coverage period. if vsoe of fair value does not exist for pcs, once the delivery criteria have been met on the standard software, service revenue is recognized on a zero profit margin basis until essential services are complete, at which point total remaining arrangement revenue is then spread ratably over the remaining pcs coverage period. if vsoe does not exist for pcs at the beginning of an arrangement but is established during implementation, revenue not recognized due to the absence of vsoe will be recognized on a cumulative basis.
accounts receivable allowance moodys records an allowance for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue, based on historical experience and current conditions. such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. additionally, estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. actual billing adjustments and uncollectible account write-offs are charged against the allowance. moodys evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current aging status of customer accounts. moodys also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. based on its analysis, moodys adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances. this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts. accordingly, moodys results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write-offs under current conditions. however, significant changes in any of the above factors, or actual write-offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could impact the companys consolidated results of operations.
contingencies accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. in many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. the company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may, in the future, adjust its associated liabilities.
for claims, litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes, where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. when the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range. in other instances, because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant. as additional information becomes available, the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly. in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation, regulatory, governmental investigations and inquiries, enforcement and similar matters and contingencies, particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties, the company cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters. the company also cannot predict the impact (if any) that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted, on its competitive position or on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. as the process to resolve any pending matters progresses, management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on its operations and financial condition. however, in light of the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of them, the absence of similar court rulings on the theories of law asserted and uncertainties regarding apportionment of any potential damages, an estimate of the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time.
the companys wholly-owned insurance subsidiary insures the company against certain risks including but not limited to deductibles for workers compensation, employment practices litigation, employee medical claims and terrorism, for which the claims are not material to the company. in addition, for claim years 2008 and 2009, the insurance subsidiary insured the company for defense costs related to professional liability claims. for matters insured by the companys insurance subsidiary, moodys records liabilities based on the estimated total claims expected to be paid and total projected costs to defend a claim through its anticipated conclusion. the company determines liabilities based on an assessment of managements best estimate of claims to be paid and legal defense costs as well as actuarially determined estimates. defense costs for matters not self-insured by the companys wholly-owned insurance subsidiary are expensed as services are provided.
30   moodys 2015 10k for income tax matters, the company employs the prescribed methodology of topic 740 of the asc which requires a company to first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. a tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets on july 31 of each year, moodys evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment.
the company has six primary reporting units: two within the companys ratings business (one for the icra business and one that encompasses all of moodys other ratings operations) and four reporting units within ma: rd&a, ers, fstc and copal amba. the rd&a reporting unit encompasses the distribution of investor-oriented research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process, in-depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies, economic research and commentary on topical events and credit analytic tools. the ers reporting unit provides products and services that support the credit risk management and regulatory compliance activities of financial institutions, primarily delivered via software that is licensed or sold on a subscription basis. the fstc reporting unit consists of the portion of the ma business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training and implementation services. the copal amba reporting unit provides outsourced research and analytical services.
the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a three-step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level. in the first step, the company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount. if a determination is made based on the qualitative factors that an impairment does not exist, the company is not required to perform further testing. if the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the company concluding that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, the fair value of the reporting unit will be determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill. if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the company must perform a third step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge. for the reporting units where the company is consistently able to conclude that no impairment exists using only a qualitative approach, the companys accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years. at july 31, 2013, the company performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test on all reporting units, which resulted in no impairment of goodwill.
at july 31, 2015 the company performed quantitative assessments of the rd&a, ers, fstc, copal amba and icra reporting units and a qualitative assessment for the remaining reporting unit. the quantitative assessments did not result in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its fair value. the qualitative analysis resulted in the company determining that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of this reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. the most significant factors in the qualitative assessment were an assessment of actual to projected results and a comparison of projected results in the prior quantitative analysis compared to the reporting units current year projection. additionally, the weighted average cost of capital (wacc) is assessed as well as the impact of various macroeconomic conditions and other factors that could impact future cash flows.
the company quantitatively tested the rd&a, ers, fstc, copal amba and icra reporting units as of july 31, 2015 due to the factors outlined below:
rd&amp;a  this reporting unit was quantitatively tested to set a new baseline valuation that includes the results of lewtan, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of
2014.
ers  this reporting unit was quantitatively tested to set a new baseline valuation to include the results of webequity, which was acquired in july 2014 and to reflect significant investments made in the business.
fstc  this reporting unit was quantitatively tested due to the small amount of excess of fair value of the reporting unit over its net assets in prior years.
copal amba  this reporting unit was quantitatively tested due to sales growth trending lower than projected at july 31, 2014 and new management in place since january
2015.
icra  this reporting unit was tested quantitatively due to it having a readily available fair value based on its stock price.

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived acquired intangible asset involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and appropriate comparable market metrics. however, as these estimates and assumptions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain, actual future results may differ from these estimates. in addition, the company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units.
other assets and liabilities, including applicable corporate assets, are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units.
sensitivity analyses and key assumptions for deriving the fair value of a reporting unit the following table identifies the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit as of december 31, 2015 as well as the amount by which the net assets of each reporting unit would exceed the fair value under step 2 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in asc topic 350, assuming hypothetical reductions in their fair values as of the date of the last quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units. for the rd&a, ers, fstc, copal amba and icra reporting units, the fair value was calculated as of july 31, 2015. for the mis reporting unit, the fair value was calculated as of july 31, 2013, as there have been no qualitative factors that have resulted in the company deeming it necessary to perform a quantitative assessment subsequent to this date.

methodologies and significant estimates utilized in determining of the fair value of reporting units:
the following is a discussion regarding the companys methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting units, excluding icra, as of the date of each reporting units last quantitative test (july 31, 2015 for rd&a, ers, fstc and copal amba; july 31, 2013 for the mis reporting unit.) as icra is a publicly traded company in india, the company was able to observe its fair value based on its market capitalization.
the fair value of each reporting unit, excluding icra, was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples. the dcf analysis requires significant estimates, including projections of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit that is based on internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long-term growth rates, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of each reporting unit which could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which could be material to the companys financial position and results of operations. moodys allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition. the company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the company due to acquisitions or realignments.
the sensitivity analyses on the future cash flows and wacc assumptions described below are as of the date of last quantitative assessment for each reporting unit. the following discusses the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology that requires significant management judgment:
»                     future cash flow assumptions: the projections for future cash flows utilized in the models are derived from historical experience and assumptions regarding future growth and profitability of each reporting unit.
these projections are consistent with the companys operating and strategic plan. cash flows for the five years subsequent to the date of the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis were utilized in the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the growth rates assumed a gradual increase in revenue from financial service customers based on a continued improvement in the global economy and capital markets, new customer acquisition and new products. beyond five years a terminal value was determined using a perpetuity growth rate based on inflation and real gdp growth rates. a sensitivity analysis of the growth rates was performed on all reporting units. for all reporting units, a 10% decrease in the growth rates used would not have resulted in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its respective estimated fair value.

32   moodys 2015 10k
»                        wacc: the wacc is the rate used to discount each reporting units estimated future cash flows. the wacc is calculated based on the proportionate weighting of the cost of debt and equity. the cost of equity is based on a risk-free interest rate, an equity risk factor which is derived from public companies similar to the reporting unit and which captures the perceived risks and uncertainties associated with the reporting units cash flows. the cost of debt component is calculated as the weighted average cost associated with all of the companys outstanding borrowings as of the date of the impairment test and was immaterial to the computation of the wacc. the cost of debt and equity is weighted based on the debt to market capitalization ratio of publicly traded companies with similarities to the reporting unit being tested. the wacc for all reporting units ranged from 9% to 12% as of the date of the last quantitative assessment for each reporting unit. differences in the wacc used between reporting units is primarily due to distinct risks and uncertainties regarding the cash flows of the different reporting units. a sensitivity analysis of the wacc was performed on all reporting units as of the date of the last quantitative goodwill assessment for each reporting unit. for all reporting units, an increase in the wacc of one percentage point would not result in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its fair value.

amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. there were no such events or changes during the year ended december 31, 2015 that would indicate that the carrying amount of amortizable intangible assets in any of the companys reporting units may not be recoverable. this determination was made based on continued growth, consistent with operating and strategic plans for the reporting unit where the intangible asset resides. additionally, there were no events or circumstances during the year ended december 31, 2015 that would indicate the need for an adjustment of the remaining useful lives of these amortizable intangible assets.
pension and other retirement benefits the expenses, assets and liabilities that moodys reports for its retirement plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. these significant assumptions include the following:
»   future compensation increases, based on the companys long-term actual experience and future outlook;

»   long-term return on pension plan assets, based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plans portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed-income investments);

»   discount rates, based on current yields on high-grade corporate long-term bonds

the discount rates selected to measure the present value of the companys benefit obligation for its retirement plans as of december 31, 2015 were derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares each plans projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the citibank pension discount curve. the cash flows by plan are then discounted back to present value to determine the discount rate applicable to each plan.
moodys major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. in determining these assumptions, the company consults with third-party actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate. while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the companys retirement plans. additionally, the company has updated its mortality assumption by adopting the newly released rp-2014 mortality tables and accompanying mortality improvement scale mp-2015 to reflect the latest information regarding future mortality expectations by the society of actuaries.
when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise. excluding differences between the expected long-term rate of return assumption and actual experience on plan assets, the company amortizes, as a component of annual pension expense, total outstanding gains or losses over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gain/loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the beginning-of-year projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. for moodys retirement plans, the total actuarial losses as of december 31, 2015 that have not been recognized in annual expense are $138.5 million, and moodys expects to recognize a net periodic expense of $10.5 million in 2016 related to the amortization of actuarial losses.
for moodys funded u.s. pension plan, the differences between the expected long-term rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense. as permitted under asc topic 715, the company spreads the impact of asset experience over a five-year period for purposes of calculating the market-related value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization. as of december 31, 2015, the company has an unrecognized asset loss of $10.5 million, of which $0.7 million will be recognized in the market-related value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets component of 2017 expense.

the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage-point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moodys 2016 operating income. these effects have been calculated using the companys current projections of 2016 expenses, assets and liabilities related to moodys retirement plans, which could change as updated data becomes available.

2016 operating income
(decrease)/increase weighted average discount rates*                                     4.04%/4.00%   $(11.4                    )
weighted average assumed compensation growth rate                          3.74%   $2.2
assumed long-term rate of return on pension assets                         6.10%   $(2.8                     )
*   weighted average discount rates of 4.04% and 4.00% for pension plans and other retirement plans, respectively.

based on current projections, the company estimates that expenses related to retirement plans will be $35.5 million in 2016 compared with $40.8 million in 2015. the expected expense decrease in 2016 reflects the effects of lower benefit obligations primarily due to higher discount rate assumptions, lower amortization of actuarial losses, and a higher assumed long term rate of return on pension assets.
stock-based compensation the company records compensation expense for all share-based payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant. this includes stock options and restricted stock. the fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black-scholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the company believes are reasonable. some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on moodys experience during the period since becoming a public company. the use of different assumptions and estimates in the black-scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense.
an increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2015 (dollars in millions):

income taxes the company is subject to income taxes in the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions. the companys tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for services provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions. the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with asc topic 740. therefore, income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes, and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes.
the company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions which involve legacy tax and other tax matters. the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for utps. the company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the companys consolidated financial statements and associated penalties, if any, as part of other non-operating expenses.
for utps, asc topic 740 requires a company to first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. a tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. as the determination of liabilities related to utps and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the company, there can be no assurance that the company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the companys operating results or financial condition.
for certain of its non-u.s. subsidiaries, the company has deemed the undistributed earnings relating to these subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested within its foreign operations. accordingly, the company has not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely
34   moodys 2015 10k reinvested earnings. it is not practicable to determine the amount of deferred taxes that might be required to be provided if such earnings were distributed in the future due to complexities in the tax laws and in the hypothetical calculations that would have to be made.
other estimates in addition, there are other accounting estimates within moodys consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated dividend distributions from non-u.s. subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates. management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moodys consolidated financial statements are appropriate. however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moodys consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moodys consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact moodys.
reportable segments the company is organized into two reportable segments at december 31, 2015: mis and ma.
the mis segment is comprised primarily of all of the companys ratings operations. the mis segment consists of five lines of business  cfg, sfg, fig, ppif and mis other. the ratings lobs generate revenue principally from fees for the assignment and ongoing monitoring of credit ratings on debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide. the mis other lob consists of certain non-ratings operations managed by mis which consists of non-rating revenue from icra as well as certain research and financial instruments pricing service operations in the asia-pacific region.
the ma segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets. the ma segment consists of three lines of business  rd&a, ers and ps.
in december 2013, a subsidiary of the company acquired amba, a provider of investment research and quantitative analytics for global financial institutions. amba is part of the ma reportable segment and its revenue is included in the ps lob. in june 2014, a subsidiary of the company acquired a controlling stake in icra, a leading provider of credit ratings and research in india. icra is part of the mis reportable segment and its ratings revenue is included in the respective ratings lobs of mis while its non-ratings revenue is included in the mis other lob. in july 2014, a subsidiary of the company acquired webequity, a leading provider of cloud-based loan origination solutions for financial institutions. webequity is part of the ma reporting segment and its revenue is included in the ers lob. in october 2014, the company acquired lewtan, a leading provider of analytical tools and data for the global structured finance market. lewtan is part of the ma reportable segment and its revenue is included in the rd&a lob.
pursuant to the acquisition of icra, the company realigned certain components of its reportable segments in the fourth quarter of 2014. this realignment resulted in the creation of the mis other lob which now consists of non-ratings revenue from icra as well as certain research and financial instruments pricing revenue in the asia-pacific region which was previously reported in the rd&a lob of ma. these businesses are all managed by mis and the expenses from these operations will be included in the mis reportable segment. all prior period results for both mis and ma have been restated to reflect this realignment and the impact of the realignment was not significant to miss or mas previously reported results.
the following is a discussion of the results of operations of the company and its reportable segments. total mis revenue and total ma expenses include the intersegment royalty revenue for mis and expense charged to ma for the rights to use and distribute content, data and products developed by mis. the royalty rate charged by mis approximates the fair value of the aforementioned content, data and products developed by mis. total ma revenue and total mis expenses include intersegment fees charged to mis from ma for the use of certain ma products and services in miss ratings process. these fees charged by ma are generally equal to the costs incurred by ma to provide these products and services. overhead charges and corporate expenses which exclusively benefit one segment are fully charged to that segment. additionally, overhead costs and corporate expenses of the company which benefit both segments are generally allocated to each segment based on a revenue-split methodology. accordingly, a reportable segments share of these costs will increase as its proportion of revenue relative to moodys total revenue increases. overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy, information technology and support staff such as finance, human resources and information technology.

executive summary
»                   moodys revenue in 2015 totaled $3,484.5 million, an increase of $150.2 million, or 5%, compared to 2014. excluding the unfavorable impact of changes in fx translation rates, primarily due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar to the euro, british pound and canadian dollar, revenue increased 9% over the prior year reflecting growth in both reportable segments despite challenging market conditions in 2015. the following discussion of mis and ma revenue excludes intersegment revenue.

»                 mis revenue was 3% higher compared to the prior year. excluding the impact from unfavorable changes in fx translation rates, mis revenue grew 8% over the prior year. this growth primarily reflects benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases as well as increases in rated issuance volumes for investment-grade corporate debt. additionally, higher u.s. pfg refunding volumes and higher u.s. banking-related issuance contributed to the growth. furthermore, there were increases across most sfg asset classes in the u.s. and emea, as well as revenue from the icra acquisition. these increases were partially offset by declines in bank loan revenue in the u.s. and emea, lower speculative-grade corporate debt revenue in emea and an approximate $102 million unfavorable impact due to changes in fx rates.

»                ma revenue grew 8% compared to the prior year reflecting growth in ers and rd&amp;a partially offset by declines in ps. excluding the impact from unfavorable changes in fx translation rates, ma revenue grew 12%. revenue growth in ers was primarily due to increases across most product offerings with particular strength in the credit assessment and origination business. additionally, the acquisition of webequity in the third quarter of 2014 also contributed to ers growth. in rd&amp;a, revenue growth was primarily driven by credit research and licensing of ratings data as well as revenue from the acquisition of lewtan. the decline in ps reflected the companys exiting certain copal amba product lines late in 2014 as well as attrition outpacing sales growth at copal amba. the 2015 ma revenue included an unfavorable impact of approximately $47 million due to unfavorable changes in fx translation rates.

»   total expenses increased $115.9 million compared to the prior year reflecting:

»   higher compensation costs of approximately $59 million primarily relating to headcount growth and annual compensation increases. partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in incentive compensation reflecting lower achievement against full-year targeted results in 2015 compared to 2014.

»   non-compensation expenses increased approximately $39 million compared to 2014 reflecting higher costs related to the companys investment in it and other operational infrastructure and higher rent and occupancy costs. additionally, the increase reflects higher variable costs correlated with business growth.

»   higher d&amp;a of $17.9 million reflecting amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions as well as higher depreciation reflecting an increase in capital expenditures to support it infrastructure and business growth.

»   the increase in both compensation and non-compensation expenses reflects operating costs from the 2014 acquisitions of icra, webequity and lewtan.

»                operating income of $1,473.4 million increased $34.3 million compared to 2014 and resulted in an operating margin of 42.3% compared to 43.2% in the prior year. adjusted operating income of $1,586.9 million in 2015
increased $52.2 million compared to 2014, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 45.5% compared to 46.0% in the prior year period. the decrease in margins is due to continued investment in the companys operations, the acquisition of companies that operate at a margin below moodys historical margin as well as the impact of fx translation. unfavorable changes in fx translation rates negatively impacted operating income and adjusted operating income by approximately $76
million and $79 million, respectively.

»   non-operating income (expense), net was ($93.8) million compared to net non-operating income of $21.9 million in 2014. the change reflects the $102.8 million icra gain in the prior year and smaller fx gains in 2015.

»   the etr remained flat compared to 2014. the 2015 etr includes a benefit relating to a state tax ruling and a change in local tax law relating to income apportionment as well as the resolution of certain domestic and international tax matters. the 2014 etr reflects a benefit from the favorable resolution of an international tax matter.

»                diluted eps of $4.63 in 2015, which included a $0.03 benefit from a legacy tax matter, increased $0.02 over 2014, which included $0.37 for the icra gain as well as a $0.03 benefit from a legacy tax matter. excluding the benefit from the legacy tax matter in both years as well as the icra gain in 2014, non-gaap diluted eps in 2015 of $4.60 was $0.39 higher than 2014 non-gaap diluted eps of $4.21. the increase in both diluted eps and non-gaap diluted eps benefited from a 5.3% reduction in diluted weighted average shares outstanding due to treasury share repurchases under the companys board authorized share repurchase program partially offset by shares issued under the employee stock-based compensation programs.

global revenue of $3,484.5 million in 2015 increased $150.2 million, or 5%, compared to 2014. excluding the unfavorable impact from changes in fx translation rates, global revenue increased 9% compared to prior year and reflected growth in both reportable segments. transaction revenue accounted for 50% of global mco revenue in both 2015 and 2014.
the mis revenue increase reflected changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases, primarily in the u.s., coupled with growth in rated issuance volumes for investment-grade corporate debt and higher u.s. pfg refunding volumes. the growth also reflects increases across all asset classes within sfg and higher banking revenue coupled with revenue from the icra acquisition. these increases were partially offset by an approximate $102 million unfavorable impact due to changes in fx rates as well as declines in rated issuance volumes for high-yield corporate debt and bank loans.
moodys 2015 10k   37
the growth in ma reflects higher revenue in rd&a and ers partially offset by decreases in ps revenue. the increase in rd&a was primarily driven by growth from sales of credit research and licensing of ratings data. the growth in ers reflects increases in all product offerings, with particular strength in the credit assessment and origination business. the 2014 acquisitions of lewtan and webequity also contributed to growth in rd&a and ers, respectively. partially offsetting these increases in ma was an approximate $47 million unfavorable impact due to changes in fx translation rates.
u.s. revenue of $2,009.0 million in 2015 increased $194.5 million over the prior year, reflecting changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases within mis, growth in rated issuance volumes for investment-grade corporate debt, higher pfg refunding volumes and revenue increases in most asset classes in sfg. the growth also reflects increases across all ma lobs. these increases were partially offset by declines in bank loan rated issuance compared to the prior year.
non-u.s. revenue decreased $44.3 million from 2014, reflecting an approximate $146 million unfavorable impact from changes in fx translation rates coupled with declines in high-yield corporate debt and bank loan issuance in emea as well as a revenue decline in ps. these declines were partially offset by increases in rd&a and ers revenue in all regions within ma as well as growth across most asset classes within sfg in emea.
operating expenses were $976.3 million in 2015 and increased $46.0 million from 2014 due to an approximate $33 million and $13 million increase in compensation and non-compensation costs, respectively. the increase in compensation costs reflected higher expenses resulting from the impact of annual compensation increases as well as higher headcount due to business growth and from acquisitions. additionally, higher pension costs contributed to the compensation expense growth reflecting a lower discount rate used to measure expense and the use of a new mortality table. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation reflecting lower achievement against full-year targeted results compared to the prior year. the increase in non-compensation expenses reflected higher costs to support various it and other operational enhancement projects, higher variable costs to support business growth and expenses from the icra, webequity and lewtan acquisitions in the second half of 2014. the changes above include a favorable impact relating to changes in fx translation rates compared to the prior year.
sg&a expenses of $921.3 million in 2015 increased $52.0 million compared to the prior year period reflecting higher compensation and non-compensation expenses of approximately $27 million and $25 million, respectively. the growth in compensation costs was primarily due to higher expenses resulting from annual compensation increases, headcount growth in mis and ma as well as in overhead support areas coupled with higher headcount from acquisitions. additionally, higher pension costs contributed to the compensation expense growth reflecting a lower discount rate used to measure expense and the use of a new mortality table. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation reflecting lower achievement against full-year targeted results compared to the prior year. the increase in non-compensation expenses reflects higher costs to support various it and other operational enhancement projects as well as higher rent and occupancy costs reflecting various real estate projects worldwide. additionally, the increase reflects non-compensation expenses from the icra, webequity and lewtan acquisitions in the second half of 2014. the increases above include a favorable impact relating to changes in fx translation rates compared to the prior year.
d&a increased $17.9 million reflecting amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions as well as higher depreciation reflecting an increase in capital expenditures to support it infrastructure and business growth.
operating income of $1,473.4 million increased $34.3 million from 2014. adjusted operating income was $1,586.9 million in 2015 and increased $52.2 million compared to 2014. operating margin decreased 90 bps compared to 2014. adjusted operating margin in 2015 of 45.5% decreased 50 bps compared to the prior year. the decrease in operating margin and adjusted operating margin is primarily due to continued investment in the companys operations as well as the acquisition of companies that operate at a margin below moodys historical margin and fx translation. unfavorable changes in fx translation rates negatively impacted operating income and adjusted operating income by approximately $76 million and $79 million, respectively.
interest income (expense), net in 2015 was ($115.1) million, or flat compared to 2014 reflecting higher interest on borrowings due to the issuance of the 2014 senior notes (5-year) and 2014 senior notes (30-year) in july 2014 as well as the issuance of the 2015 senior notes and additional issuance under the 2014 senior notes (30-year) in 2015. these increases were offset by $11 million in net costs (net of a gain on the termination of an interest rate swap) related to the early repayment of the series 2005-1 notes in 2014.
other non-operating income (expense), net was $21.3 million in 2015, a $14.6 million decrease in income compared to 2014. the decrease primarily reflects fx gains of $20.3 million in 2014 which was primarily due to strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to the euro and british pound for certain u.s. dollar denominated assets held in international jurisdictions. the fx gains in 2015 were not significant.
the $102.8 million icra gain related to a fair value remeasurement of the companys previously held equity investment in icra which occurred in connection with moodys acquiring a controlling stake in icra on june 26, 2014.
38   moodys 2015 10k the companys etr was 31.2% in 2015, or flat compared to 2014. the 2015 etr includes a benefit relating to a state tax ruling and a change in local tax law relating to income apportionment as well as the resolution of certain domestic and international tax matters. the 2014 etr reflects a benefit from the favorable resolution of an international tax matter.
net income in 2015, which included a $6.4 million benefit related to the aforementioned legacy tax matter, was $941.3 million, or $4.63 per diluted share. this is a decrease of $47.4 million compared to 2014, which included $78.5 million for the icra gain as well as a $6.4 million benefit related to a legacy tax matter. however, diluted eps was up $0.02 reflecting benefits from a 5.3% reduction in diluted weighted average shares outstanding due to treasury share repurchases under the companys board authorized share repurchase program partially offset by shares issued under the employee stock-based compensation programs. excluding the $0.37 icra gain in 2014 and benefits from legacy tax matters in both years, non-gaap diluted eps of $4.60 in 2015 was $0.39 higher than non-gaap diluted eps of $4.21 in the prior year.

the following is a discussion of external mis revenue and operating expenses:
global mis revenue of $2,334.2 million in 2015 increased $68.4 million, or 3%, compared to 2014. excluding unfavorable changes in fx translation rates, mis revenue grew 8% over the prior year and reflected growth across all lobs. transaction revenue for mis was 61% in both 2015 and 2014.
in the u.s., revenue was $1,474.3 million in 2015, an increase of $133.3 million compared to 2014 reflecting changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases coupled with growth in rated issuance volumes for investment-grade corporate debt and higher public finance refunding volumes. the increase also reflects growth across most asset classes in sfg coupled with higher banking revenue. these increases were partially offset by lower rated issuance volumes for bank loans compared to the prior year.
non-u.s. revenue was $859.9 million in 2015, a decrease of $64.9 million compared to 2014. excluding unfavorable changes in fx translation rates, revenue grew 4% over the prior year reflecting the favorable impact of changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases, higher investment-grade revenue in emea, growth across most asset classes within sfg in emea moodys 2015 10k   39
and revenue from the icra acquisition. partially offsetting these increases was lower revenue from rating high-yield corporate debt and bank loans as well as lower indicative ratings revenue in the emea region. additionally, there was an approximate $99 million unfavorable impact relating to changes in fx translation rates.
global cfg revenue of $1,112.7 million in 2015 was flat compared to 2014. excluding unfavorable changes in fx translation rates, revenue grew 4% over the prior year primarily due to the benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases, primarily in the u.s. as well as higher rated issuance volumes for investment-grade corporate debt in the u.s. the growth in rated issuance volumes for investment-grade corporate debt, which was more pronounced in the first half of 2015, reflects an increase in m&a activity and continued favorable market conditions for much of the year. additionally, revenue from the icra acquisition and higher monitoring fees reflecting growth in the number of outstanding rated issuances contributed to the increase over the prior year. these increases were partially offset by a decline in bank loan issuance in the u.s. and emea as banks reduced supply to adhere more closely to the u.s. shared national credit program regarding highly leveraged transactions. the increases were also partially offset by declines in high-yield corporate debt across all non-u.s. regions reflecting widening credit spreads in this sector resulting from weak commodity prices coupled with current macroeconomic uncertainties in emerging markets. additionally, there was an approximate $41 million unfavorable impact from changes in fx translation rates compared to the prior year. transaction revenue represented 69% of total cfg revenue in 2015, compared to 70% in the prior year period. in the u.s., revenue in 2015 was $752.9 million, or $65.6 million higher than the prior year. internationally, revenue of $359.8 million in the 2015 decreased $62.2 million compared to the prior year.
global sfg revenue of $449.1 million in 2015 increased $22.6 million, or 5%, compared to 2014. excluding the unfavorable impact of fx translation rates, sfg revenue grew 10% reflecting an increase in u.s. cmbs issuance primarily due to higher refinancing activity resulting from a large volume of maturing instruments in 2015 coupled with larger sized deals being rated. the growth also reflects higher u.s. rmbs revenue resulting from an increase in deals rated and improved market coverage over the prior year. furthermore, there was an increase in covered bond issuance in emea as well as benefits from the favorable impact of changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases. partially offsetting these increases was an approximate $22 million unfavorable impact reflecting changes in fx translation rates compared to the prior year. transaction revenue was 64% of total sfg revenue in 2015 compared to 62% in the prior year. in the u.s., revenue of $311.5 million increased $28.6 million compared to 2014. non-u.s. revenue in 2015 of $137.6 million decreased $6.0 million from the prior year.
global fig revenue of $365.6 million in 2015 increased $10.9 million, or 3%, compared to 2014. excluding the unfavorable impact of changes in fx translation rates, fig revenue grew 10% due to changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases. additionally, the growth reflects higher rated issuance volumes in the u.s. banking sector reflecting issuers taking advantage of favorable market conditions for much of the year as well as revenue from the icra acquisition. these increases were partially offset by an approximate $24 million unfavorable impact from changes in fx translation rates. transaction revenue was 37% of total fig revenue in 2015 compared to 35% in the prior year. in the u.s., revenue of $156.4 million increased $15.2 million compared to the prior year. internationally, revenue was $209.2 million in 2015, or down $4.3 million compared to 2014.
global ppif revenue was $376.4 million in 2015 and increased $19.1 million, or 5%, compared to 2014. excluding the impact of unfavorable changes in fx translation rates, ppif revenue grew 10% reflecting higher u.s. public finance refunding volumes due to continued low benchmark interest rates as well as the favorable impact of changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases. these increases were partially offset by lower u.s. infrastructure finance revenue compared to a strong prior year comparative period as well as an approximate $15 million unfavorable impact from changes in fx translation rates. transaction revenue was 60% of total ppif revenue in 2015 compared to 58% in the prior year. in the u.s., revenue in 2015 was $244.7 million and increased $18.5 million compared to 2014. outside the u.s., ppif revenue was flat compared to 2014.
global mis other revenue was $30.4 million in 2015 and increased $12.4 million, or 69% compared to 2014. the increase primarily reflects a full year of icra non-ratings revenue in 2015 compared to just one quarter of revenue in 2014.
operating and sg&a expenses in 2015 increased $44.3 million compared to 2014 reflecting an increase in compensation and non-compensation costs of $20 million and $24 million, respectively. the increase in compensation reflects annual merit increases, headcount growth in the ratings lobs as well as in support areas such as it, finance and human resources for which the costs are allocated to each segment based on a revenue-split methodology. these increases were partially offset by decreases in incentive compensation costs reflecting lower achievement against full-year targeted results compared to the prior year. the increase in non-compensation expenses reflects higher costs to support various it and operational enhancement projects and higher variable costs correlated with business growth. also, there were higher rent and occupancy costs for various global real estate expansion projects. the increase in both compensation and non-compensation expenses also reflects the acquisition of icra in the second half of 2014. changes in fx translation rates had an approximate $42 million favorable impact on mis operating expenses compared to the prior year.
40   moodys 2015 10k adjusted operating income and operating income in 2015 were $1,307.4 million and $1,241.4 million, respectively, and increased $30.2 million and $13.6 million, respectively, compared to 2014. adjusted operating margin and operating margin were 53.9% and 51.1%, respectively, or 40 bps and 110 bps lower than the prior year, respectively. adjusted operating income and operating income both include intersegment revenue and expense.

the following is a discussion of external ma revenue and operating expenses:
global ma revenue increased $81.8 million, or 8%, compared to 2014. excluding the unfavorable changes in fx translation rates, ma revenue grew 12% reflecting growth in rd&a and ers which included revenue from the acquisitions of lewtan and webequity, respectively. recurring revenue comprised 74% and 73% of total ma revenue in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
in the u.s., revenue of $534.7 million in 2015 increased $61.2 million, and reflected growth in rd&a and ers, which included revenue from lewtan and webequity, respectively.
international revenue of $615.6 million in 2015 was $20.6 million higher than in 2014 reflecting growth in all regions within rd&a and ers partially offset by an approximate $47 million unfavorable impact from changes in fx translation rates.
global rd&a revenue of $626.4 million, which comprised 54% of total external ma revenue in both 2015 and 2014, increased $54.6 million, or 10%, over the prior year period. excluding the unfavorable impact of fx translation rates, rd&a revenue grew 14% compared to the prior year. the growth over the prior year was most notable in the u.s. and emea, primarily due to strong sales of credit research, licensing of ratings data and economic analysis and data. the acquisition of lewtan in late 2014 also contributed to growth over the prior year. in the u.s., revenue of $351.9 million increased $45.1 million compared to 2014. internationally, revenue increased $9.5 million compared to the prior year and included an approximate $24 million unfavorable impact relating to unfavorable changes in fx translation rates.
global ers revenue of $374.0 million in 2015 increased $45.5 million, or 14%, over 2014. excluding the unfavorable impact of changes in fx translation rates, ers revenue grew 19%. this growth reflects increases across all product offerings with particular strength in the credit assessment and origination business which included revenue recognized internationally from a large software implementation engagement for which vsoe for the annual software maintenance was established near the conclusion of the project. additionally, the acquisition of webequity contributed to the revenue growth. revenue in ers is subject to quarterly volatility resulting from the variable nature of project timing and the concentration of software implementation and license revenue in a relatively small number of engagements. in the u.s., revenue of $131.2 million increased $21.1 million compared to 2014. internationally, revenue of $242.8 million increased $24.4 million compared to the prior year and included an approximate $17 million unfavorable impact relating to changes in fx translation rates.
moodys 2015 10k   41
revenue from ps was $149.9 million and decreased $18.3 million, or 11%, from 2014. excluding the unfavorable impact from changes in fx translation rates, ps revenue declined 7% primarily due to the company exiting certain copal amba product lines late in 2014 as well as attrition outpacing sales growth at copal amba as global banks adjusted their business activities. in the u.s., revenue of $51.6 million decreased $5.0 million compared to 2014. internationally, revenue decreased $13.3 million compared to the prior year and included an approximate $6 million unfavorable impact reflecting changes in fx translation rates.
operating and sg&a expenses in 2015 increased $53.7 million compared to 2014. the expense growth reflects an approximate $39 million increase in compensation costs primarily due to higher headcount to support business growth as well as higher headcount in support areas, for which the costs are allocated to each segment based on a revenue- split methodology. headcount from the acquisitions of webequity and lewtan as well as annual merit increases also contributed to the compensation expense growth. non-compensation expenses increased approximately $15 million due to higher costs for continued investment in it infrastructure as well as costs related to ers product development and project delivery. also, the expense growth reflected additional non-compensation costs related to the acquisitions of webequity and lewtan. changes in fx translation rates had an approximate $29 million favorable impact on ma operating expenses in 2015 compared to the prior year.
adjusted operating income was $279.5 million in 2015 and increased $22.0 million compared to the same period in 2014. operating income of $232.0 million in 2015 increased $20.7 million compared to the same period in 2014. adjusted operating margin in 2015 was 24.0%, up 20 bps from 2014. operating margin was 19.9% in 2015, up 40 bps from the prior year. adjusted operating income and operating income both include intersegment revenue and expense.

executive summary
»   moodys revenue in 2014 totaled $3,334.3 million, an increase of $361.8 million compared to 2013 and reflected growth in both mis and ma. the following discussion of mis and ma revenue excludes intersegment revenues.

»                      mis revenue was 9% higher compared to the prior year. the growth primarily reflects benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases as well as higher rated issuance volumes for investment-grade corporate debt, clos and bank loans. the growth also reflects higher monitoring fees across all regions. these increases were partially offset by declines in rated issuance volumes in high-yield corporate debt as well as banking-related revenue in the u.s.

»                     ma revenue grew 19% compared to the prior year and reflected growth across all lobs. the increase in rd&amp;a revenue, which was most notable in the u.s. and emea, was primarily due to increases in credit research, licensing of ratings data and economic analysis and data. the increase in ers revenue was primarily due to growth across nearly all product offerings, most notably in the asset-liability and capital solution, credit origination, insurance and stress testing business. ps revenue increased 42% primarily reflecting the acquisition of amba in the fourth quarter of 2013.

»   total expenses increased $157.3 million compared to the prior year reflecting:

»   higher compensation costs of approximately $155 million primarily relating to headcount growth (both organic and from acquisitions) and annual compensation increases coupled with higher incentive compensation reflecting higher achievement against full-year targeted results in 2014 compared to 2013.

»   non-compensation expenses were flat compared to 2013 with higher rent and occupancy costs, higher costs related to the companys investment in it infrastructure and higher variable costs correlated with business growth and from acquisitions being offset by a litigation settlement charge in the prior year.

»               operating income of $1,439.1 million increased $204.5 million compared to 2013 and resulted in an operating margin of 43.2%, compared to 41.5% in the prior year. adjusted operating income of $1,534.7 million in 2014
increased $206.7 million compared to 2013, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 46.0% compared to 44.7% in the prior year period. both the operating margin and adjusted operating margin in 2013 included the aforementioned litigation settlement charge.

»   non-operating income (expense), net was $21.9 million compared to net expense of ($65.3) million in 2013. the change reflects the $102.8 million icra gain and fx gains relating to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar to the euro and british pound partially offset by higher interest expense reflecting additional long-term debt issued by the company in 2014.

»   the etr increased 90bps compared to 2013 primarily due to a greater legacy tax settlement in 2013, as well as a tax benefit in 2013 related to retroactive tax legislation.

»                diluted eps of $4.61 in 2014, which included $0.37 for the icra gain as well as a $0.03 benefit from a legacy tax matter, increased $1.01 over 2013, which included a $0.14 charge related to the aforementioned litigation settlement and a $0.09 benefit from a legacy tax matter. excluding the icra gain and litigation settlement charge in 2014 and 2013, respectively, and the benefit from the legacy tax matters in both years, non-gaap diluted eps in 2014 of $4.21 was
$0.56 higher than 2013 non-gaap diluted eps of $3.65.

*   total as of december 31, 2014 includes approximately 1,300 staff from the acquisitions of icra, lewtan and webequity of which a significant portion are located in low cost jurisdictions.

global revenue of $3,334.3 million in 2014 increased $361.8 million compared to 2013 reflecting growth in both mis and ma. the primary drivers of the increase in mis revenue reflect changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases, primarily in the u.s., coupled with growth in rated issuance volumes for clos, investment-grade corporate debt and bank loans. also contributing to the growth were higher monitoring fees. the growth in ma reflects higher revenue across all lobs. the growth in rd&a resulted from increases in credit research, licensing of ratings data and economic analysis and data while the growth in ps reflected revenue from the fourth quarter 2013 acquisition of amba as well as growth from the copal and fstc businesses. the increase in ers moodys 2015 10k   43
was driven by growth across nearly all product offerings, most notably in the asset-liability and capital solutions, credit origination, insurance and stress-testing verticals. additionally, ers revenue benefitted from the acquisition of webequity solutions in july 2014. transaction revenue accounted for 50% of global mco revenue in both 2014 and 2013.
u.s. revenue of $1,814.5 million in 2014 increased $188.0 million over the prior year, reflecting changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases within mis as well as growth in rated issuance volumes for investment-grade corporate debt and clos. also contributing to the growth were higher monitoring fees in mis and growth across all lobs within ma. these increases were partially offset by declines in high-yield corporate debt rated issuance volumes as well as declines in mis banking-related revenue which is primarily due to an unfavorable shift in issuance mix.
non-u.s. revenue increased $173.8 million compared to 2013, reflecting growth across all regions in both reportable segments. the growth in the mis segment reflected changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases as well as higher bank loan rated issuance volumes in emea. additionally, higher banking-related rated issuance volumes in asia-pacific and higher monitoring fees in all regions contributed to the mis growth. additionally, the non-u.s. growth within ma reflected increases in all lobs across all regions.
operating expenses were $930.3 million in 2014 and increased $107.9 million from 2013 primarily due to an approximate $92 million increase in compensation costs reflecting higher salaries and related employee benefits resulting from the impact of annual compensation increases and growth in headcount due to incremental hires and the acquisitions of amba, webequity, icra and lewtan. also contributing to the increase in compensation expenses were higher incentive compensation costs reflecting greater achievement against full-year targeted results compared to the prior year. additionally, non-compensation expenses increased approximately $16 million primarily reflecting costs associated with the aforementioned acquisitions as well as higher costs to support investments in it infrastructure.
sg&a expenses of $869.3 million in 2014 increased $47.2 million compared to the prior year period reflecting higher compensation and non-compensation expenses partially offset by the first quarter 2013 litigation settlement charge relating to two matters regarding structured finance transactions rated by mis. the growth in compensation costs of approximately $63 million was primarily due to higher salaries and related employee benefits resulting from annual compensation increases, headcount growth in mis and ma as well as in overhead support areas coupled with higher headcount from acquisitions. also contributing to the increase in compensation expenses were higher incentive compensation costs reflecting greater achievement against full-year targeted results compared to the prior year coupled with headcount growth. additionally, there were higher rent and occupancy costs of approximately $13 million reflecting additional floors leased at the companys 7wtc headquarters coupled with various other real estate expansion projects worldwide as well as higher costs to support investments in the companys it infrastructure. also, incremental non-compensation expenses from acquisitions contributed to the expense growth.
operating income of $1,439.1 million increased $204.5 million from 2013. adjusted operating income was $1,534.7 million in 2014 and increased $206.7 million compared to 2013. operating margin increased 170 bps compared to 2013. adjusted operating margin in 2014 of 46.0% increased 130 bps compared to the prior year. the increase in operating margin and adjusted operating margin is primarily due to the aforementioned litigation settlement charge in 2013 which negatively impacted the prior year margins.
interest income (expense), net in 2014 was ($116.8) million, a $25.0 million increase in net expense compared to 2013. this increase is primarily due to approximately $26 million in higher interest expense resulting from the issuance of the 2013 senior notes in august 2013 as well as the issuance of the 2014 senior notes (5-year) and 2014 senior notes (30-year) in july 2014. also, the increase in interest expense included approximately $11 million in net costs (net of a gain on the settlement of an interest rate swap) relating to the early repayment of the series 2005-1 notes.
other non-operating income (expense), net was $35.9 million in 2014, a $9.4 million increase in income compared to 2013. the increase reflects fx gains of $20.3 million in 2014 which is primarily due to strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to the euro and british pound for certain u.s. dollar denominated assets held in international jurisdictions. this increase was partially offset by an approximate $13 million higher benefit from the resolution of legacy tax matters in 2013 compared to 2014.
the $102.8 million icra gain related to a fair value remeasurement of the companys previously held equity investment in icra which occurred in connection with moodys acquiring a controlling stake in icra on june 26, 2014.
the companys etr was 31.1% in 2014, up from 30.2% in 2013. the increase was primarily due to a greater legacy tax settlement in 2013 as well as a tax benefit in 2013 related to retroactive tax legislation.
net income in 2014, which included $78.5 million for the icra gain as well as a $6.4 million benefit related to the aforementioned legacy tax matter, was $988.7 million, or $4.61 per diluted share. this is an increase of $184.2 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, compared to 2013, which included a $0.14 charge related to the settlement of certain legal matters and a $0.09 benefit related to the resolution of a legacy tax matter. excluding the $0.37 icra gain in 2014, the litigation settlement charge in 2013 and benefits from legacy tax matters in both years, non-gaap diluted eps of $4.21 in 2014 was $0.56 higher than non-gaap diluted eps of $3.65 in the prior year

the following is a discussion of external mis revenue and operating expenses:
global mis revenue of $2,265.8 million in 2014 increased $194.2 million compared to 2013 with the most notable drivers reflecting benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases as well as higher rated issuance volumes for investment-grade corporate debt and clos. the growth over 2013 also reflects higher monitoring fees across all regions. these increases were partially offset by declines in rated issuance volumes in high-yield corporate debt as well as banking-related revenue in the u.s. transaction revenue for mis was 61% in 2014, down slightly from 62% in the prior year.
in the u.s., revenue was $1,341.0 million in 2014, an increase of $124.3 million compared to 2013 reflecting changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases coupled with growth in rated issuance volumes for investment-grade corporate debt and clos. additionally, higher monitoring fees contributed to the revenue growth. these increases were partially offset by unfavorable issuance mix in the banking sector and lower rated issuance volumes for speculative-grade corporate debt.
non-u.s. revenue was $924.8 million in 2014, an increase of $69.9 million compared to 2013. the growth reflects higher bank loan and structured credit revenue in emea and asia-pacific and higher banking-related issuance volumes in asia-pacific. also contributing to the growth were changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases, as well as higher monitoring fees across all regions resulting from an expanding base of monitored instruments. revenue from the icra acquisition in the second half of 2014 also contributed to the growth. partially offsetting these increases were declines in investment-grade corporate debt, abs, covered bond and infrastructure finance revenue in the emea region.
global cfg revenue of $1,109.3 million in 2014 increased $112.5 million from 2013 reflecting higher u.s. investment-grade rated issuance volumes coupled with changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases, primarily in the u.s. the growth in u.s. investment grade revenue reflects increases in rated issuance volumes, most notably in the fourth quarter of 2014, reflecting issuance related to m&a activity and a shift of investor demand towards high-grade instruments due to falling oil prices and geopolitical and global macroeconomic growth uncertainties. monitoring and program fee revenue also contributed to the revenue growth in all regions due to an expanding base of monitored instruments. additionally, there were higher rated issuance volumes for bank loans in emea reflecting issuers taking advantage of favorable market conditions as well as higher bank loan revenue in the u.s. reflecting a favorable shift in issuance mix. partially offsetting these increases was a decline in high-yield corporate debt issuance in the moodys 2015 10k   45
u.s. reflecting investor demand shifting to investment-grade securities as well as declines in investment-grade revenue in emea compared to robust refinancing issuance volumes in the prior year. transaction revenue represented 70% of total cfg revenue in 2014, compared to 73% in the prior year period. in the u.s., revenue in 2014 was $687.3 million, or $74.1 million higher than the prior year. internationally, revenue of $422.0 million in the 2014 increased $38.4 million compared to the prior year.
global sfg revenue of $426.5 million in 2014 increased $44.0 million compared to 2013 primarily due to higher rated issuance volumes for clos in the u.s. and emea resulting from growing liquidity demand coupled with increased investor demand reflecting solid performance and low underlying defaults in this asset class. also contributing to the growth was an increase in cref revenue which reflected higher average fees on cmbs deals and higher monitoring revenue as well as the favorable impact of changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and certain pricing increases. partially offsetting these increases were declines in abs and covered bond issuance in emea reflecting banks in the region utilizing the unsecured financing market and declines in automobile loans and credit card securitization in the region. transaction revenue was 62% of total sfg revenue in 2014 compared to 60% in the prior year. in the u.s., revenue of $282.9 million increased $38.2 million compared to 2013. non-u.s. revenue in 2014 of $143.6 million increased $5.8 million compared to the prior year.
global fig revenue of $354.7 million in 2014 was $15.9 million higher compared to 2013 due to changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases as well as higher banking-related issuance in the asia-pacific region. partially offsetting these increases was a decline in u.s. banking revenue which reflected an unfavorable shift in issuance mix. transaction revenue was 35% of total fig revenue in both 2014 and 2013. in the u.s., revenue was $141.2 million, or down $2.2 million compared to the prior year. internationally, revenue was $213.5 million in 2014, or $18.1 million higher compared to 2013.
global ppif revenue was $357.3 million in 2014 and increased $16.0 million compared to 2013. the growth reflects changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases partially offset by lower u.s. public finance refunding volumes in the first three quarters of 2014 due to higher benchmark interest rates. transaction revenue was 58% of total ppif revenue in 2014 compared to 60% in the prior year. in the u.s., revenue in 2014 was $226.2 million and increased $10.8 million compared to 2013. outside the u.s., ppif revenue increased $5.2 million compared to 2013.
global mis other revenue was $18.0 million in 2014 and increased $5.8 million, or 48% compared to 2013. the increase primarily reflects non-ratings revenue from the icra acquisition in 2014.
operating and sg&a expenses in 2014 increased $41.3 million compared to 2013 primarily reflecting higher compensation costs of approximately $70 million resulting from annual compensation increases, headcount growth in the ratings lobs and from the acquisition of icra as well as in support areas such as it, finance and human resources for which the costs are allocated to each segment based on a revenue-split methodology. also, there were higher non-compensation costs in 2014 to support the companys it systems and infrastructure as well as higher rent and occupancy costs of approximately $9 million for additional leased floors at 7wtc coupled with various other global real estate expansion projects. furthermore, the increase in non-compensation expenses reflected the consolidation of the results of operations for icra in the fourth quarter of 2014. these increases were partially offset by a litigation settlement charge in 2013 regarding two structured finance transactions rated by mis.
adjusted operating income and operating income in 2014 were $1,277.2 million and $1,227.8 million, respectively, and increased $161.0 million and $158.3 million, respectively, compared to 2013. adjusted operating margin and operating margin were 54.3% and 52.2%, respectively, or 240 bps and 250 bps higher than the prior year, respectively. the increase in both margins compared to the prior year is primarily due to the aforementioned litigation settlement charge in 2013. adjusted operating income and operating income both include intersegment revenue and expense.

the following is a discussion of external ma revenue and operating expenses:
global ma revenue increased $167.6 million compared to 2013, with growth across all lobs. recurring revenue comprised 73% and 77% of total ma revenue in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
in the u.s., revenue of $473.5 million in 2014 increased $63.7 million, and reflected growth across all lobs. international revenue of $595.0 million in 2014 was $103.9 million higher than in 2013.
global rd&a revenue, which comprised 54% and 58% of total external ma revenue in 2014 and 2013, respectively, increased $52.0 million over the prior year period. the growth, which was most notable in the u.s. and emea, was primarily due to increases in credit research, licensing of ratings data and economic analysis and data. additionally, the growth reflected general market price increases, the favorable impact of changes in fx translation rates and revenue from the acquisition of lewtan in the fourth quarter of 2014. in the u.s., revenue of $306.8 million increased $25.0 million compared to 2013. internationally, revenue increased $27.0 million compared to the prior year.
global ers revenue in 2014 increased $66.0 million over 2013, primarily due to growth across nearly all product offerings, most notably in the asset-liability and capital solutions, credit origination, insurance and stress testing verticals. the revenue growth also reflects the acquisition of webequity in the third quarter of 2014. revenue in ers is subject to quarterly volatility resulting from the variable nature of project timing and the concentration of software implementation and license revenue in a relatively small number of engagements. in the u.s., revenue of $110.1 million increased $13.7 million compared to 2013. internationally, revenue of $218.4 million increased $52.3 million compared to the prior year.
revenue from ps increased $49.6 million compared to 2013 with approximately 84% of the growth reflecting revenue from the acquisition of amba in the fourth quarter of 2013. in addition to the acquisition of amba, the growth reflects further penetration into the market for outsourced research and analytical services as well as growth in the fstc business. in the u.s., revenue of $56.6 million increased $25.0 million compared to 2013. internationally, revenue increased $24.6 million compared to the prior year.
operating and sg&a expenses in 2014 increased $113.8 million compared to 2013. the expense growth reflects an approximate $85 million increase in compensation costs primarily due to higher headcount to support business growth as well as higher headcount in support areas, for which the costs are allocated to each segment based on a revenue- split methodology. headcount from the acquisitions of amba, webequity and lewtan as well as annual merit increases also contributed to the compensation expense growth. the growth in compensation costs also reflects higher incentive compensation due to higher achievement against full-year targeted results compared to the prior year. non-compensation expenses increased approximately $29 million due to higher consulting costs for moodys 2015 10k   47
continued investment in it infrastructure as well as costs related to ers product development and project delivery. furthermore, there was an increase in rent and occupancy costs of approximately $6 million reflecting additional floors at 7wtc as well as various other real estate expansion projects worldwide. also, the expense growth reflected additional non-compensation costs related to the acquisitions of amba, webequity and lewtan. these increases were partially offset by approximately $6 million in lower contingent consideration costs relating to the copal acquisition.
market risk foreign exchange risk:
moodys maintains a presence in 35 countries outside the u.s. in 2015, approximately 46% and 60% of the companys revenue and expenses, respectively, were reported in functional currencies other than the u.s. dollar, principally in the british pound and the euro. as such, the company is exposed to market risk from changes in fx rates. as of december 31, 2015, approximately 58% of moodys assets were located outside the u.s. making the company susceptible to fluctuations in fx rates. the effects of translating assets and liabilities of non-u.s. operations with non-u.s. functional currencies to the u.s. dollar are charged or credited to aoci in the consolidated statements of shareholders equity (deficit).
the effects of revaluing assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than a subsidiarys functional currency are charged to other non-operating income (expense), net in the companys consolidated statements of operations. accordingly, the company enters into foreign exchange forwards to partially mitigate the change in fair value on certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiarys functional currency. if the euro were to weaken 10% relative u.s. dollar, there would be an approximate $7 million unfavorable impact to the fair value of the forward contracts. if the british pound were to weaken 10% relative to the euro, there would be an approximate $2 million unfavorable impact to the fair value of the forward contracts. additionally, if other foreign currencies in the companys foreign exchange forward portfolio were to devalue 10% compared to the euro, there would be an approximate $3 million favorable impact to the fair value of the forward contracts. the change in fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would be offset by fx revaluation gains or losses in future earnings on underlying assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiarys functional currency. additional information on the companys forward contracts can be found in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements located in item 8 of this form 10k.
additionally, the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the exposure related to non-u.s. dollar net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries against adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. any change in the fair value of these hedges that is the result of ineffectiveness would be recognized immediately in other non-operating (expense) income in the companys consolidated statements of operations. for the year ended december 31, 2015, all gains and losses on these derivatives designated as net investment hedges were recognized in oci. if the japanese yen were to appreciate 10% compared to the u.s. dollar, there would be an approximate $18 million unfavorable impact to the foreign currency forward designated as a net investment hedge with a japanese yen/u.s. dollar currency pairing. if the british pound were to appreciate 10% compared to the euro, there would be an approximate $4 million unfavorable impact to the foreign currency forward designated as a net investment hedge with a british pound/euro currency pairing. these adjustments would partially offset the currency translation adjustment component of aoci. additional information on the companys forward contracts designated as net investment hedges can be found in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements located in item 8 of this form 10k.
also, the company has designated 400 million of the 2015 senior notes as a net investment hedge to mitigate fx exposure relating to euro denominated net investments in subsidiaries. if the euro were to strengthen 10% relative to the u.s. dollar, there would be an approximate $44 million unfavorable adjustment to oci. this adjustment would be offset by favorable translation adjustments on the companys euro net investment in subsidiaries.
in conjunction with the designation of a portion of the 2015 senior notes as a net investment hedge, the company entered into a cross-currency swap (exchanging 100 million for u.s. dollars) to mitigate fx exposure on the remaining principal balance of the 2015 senior notes not designated as a net investment hedge. if the euro were to weaken 10% relative to the u.s. dollar, there would be an approximate $13 million unfavorable impact to the fair value of the cross-currency swap which would be partially offset by favorable revaluation gains on the 100 million of the 2015 senior notes.
moodys aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short- term investments of $2.2 billion at december 31, 2015 consisted of $1.5 billion located outside the u.s. approximately 46% of the companys aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at december 31, 2015 were held in currencies other than usd. as such, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar, particularly the euro and gbp, could reduce the reported amount of usd cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.
credit and interest rate risk:
the companys interest rate risk management objectives are to reduce the funding cost and volatility to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile. moodys uses interest rate swaps as deemed necessary to assist in accomplishing these objectives.
48   moodys 2015 10k the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its various outstanding fixed rate debt for which the fair value of the outstanding fixed rate debt fluctuates based on changes in interest rates. the company has entered into interest rate swaps to convert the fixed rate of interest on certain of its borrowings to a floating rate based on the 3-month libor. these swaps are adjusted to fair market value based on prevailing interest rates at the end of each reporting period and fluctuations are recorded as a reduction or addition to the carrying value of the borrowing, while net interest payments are recorded as interest expense/income in the companys consolidated statement of operations. a hypothetical change of 100bps in the libor-based swap rate would result in an approximate $45 million change to the fair value of these interest rate swaps.
additional information on these interest rate swaps is disclosed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements located in item 8 of this form 10k.
moodys cash equivalents consist of investments in high-quality investment-grade securities within and outside the u.s. with maturities of three months or less when purchased. the company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds, money market deposit accounts, certificates of deposit and issuers of high-grade commercial paper and by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer. short-term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit.
liquidity and capital resources cash flow the company is currently financing its operations, capital expenditures and share repurchases from operating and financing cash flow.

indebtedness at december 31, 2015, moodys had $3.4 billion of outstanding debt and $1.0 billion of additional capacity available under the 2015 facility. all significant terms of the companys indebtedness are more fully described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. at december 31, 2015, the company was in compliance with all covenants contained within all of the debt agreements. the 2015 facility, the 2007 agreement, the 2010 indenture, the 2012 indenture, the 2013 indenture, the 2014 indenture and the 2015 indenture contain cross default provisions. these provisions state that default under one of the aforementioned debt instruments could in turn permit lenders under other debt instruments to declare borrowings outstanding under those instruments to be immediately due and payable. as of december 31, 2015, there were no such cross defaults.
on march 9, 2015, the company issued 500 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a public offering. the 2015 senior notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 1.75% and mature on march 9, 2027. the terms of the 2015 senior notes are more fully described in note 15 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
the company has designated 400 million of the 2015 senior notes as a net investment hedge against foreign currency exposure relating to its net investment in its subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro. the company also entered into a 100 million cross currency swap (swapping euros for u.s. dollars) to hedge fx risk on the remaining principal balance denominated in euros that was not designated as a net investment hedge. these hedging instruments are more fully described in note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
on may 11, 2015, the company entered into a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility with the capacity to borrow up to $1 billion. the 2015 facility replaces the $1 billion 2012 facility that was scheduled to expire in april 2017 and is more fully described in note 15 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. at december 31, 2015, there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility.
on november 13, 2015, the company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a public offering. the notes were a further issuance of, will be fungible with and will be consolidated and form a single series with the companys outstanding 2014 senior notes (30-year), issued on july 16, 2014 in the amount of $300 million. the notes will trade interchangeably with the previously issued 2014 senior notes (30-year) and the aggregate principal amount of the 2014 senior notes (30-year) is $600 million at december 31, 2015.

management may consider pursuing additional long-term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for operations, share repurchases and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs.
other material future cash requirements the company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements and expects to have positive operating cash flow for the next twelve months. cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend, among other things, on the companys profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. the company may also borrow from various sources.
the company remains committed to using its strong cash flow to create value for shareholders by investing in growing areas of the business, reinvesting in ratings quality initiatives, making selective acquisitions, repurchasing stock and paying a dividend, all in manner consistent with maintaining sufficient liquidity after giving effect to any additional indebtedness that may be incurred. in december 2015, the board of directors of the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share of moodys common stock, payable on march 10, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on february 19, 2016. the continued payment of dividends at this rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the board. in december 2014, the board approved $1.0 billion of share repurchase authority which has a remaining repurchase authority of approximately $466 million at december 31, 2015. in december 2015, the board authorized an additional $1.0 billion of share repurchase authority which will be utilized following completion of the program authorized in december 2014. full-year 2016 total share repurchases are expected to be approximately $1 billion, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions.
on february 6, 2008, the company entered into an operating lease agreement to occupy six floors of an office tower located in the canary wharf district of london, england. the canary wharf lease has an initial term of 17.5- years with a total of 15 years of renewal options. the total base rent of the canary wharf lease over its initial 17.5-year term is approximately £134 million, and the company began making base rent payments in 2011. in addition to the base rent payments the company will be obligated to pay certain customary amounts for its share of operating expenses and tax obligations. the total remaining lease payments as of december 31, 2015 are approximately £94 million, of which approximately £10 million will be paid in the next twelve months. payments under this lease agreement are included in the contractual obligations table below.
on october 20, 2006, the company entered into an operating lease agreement with 7 world trade center, llc for 589,945 square-feet of an office building located at 7wtc at 250 greenwich street, new york, new york, which is serving as moodys headquarters. the 7wtc lease has an initial term of 21 years with a total of 20 years of renewal options. on march 28, 2007, the 7wtc lease agreement was amended for the company to lease an additional 78,568 square-feet at 7wtc. the total remaining lease payments for the 7wtc leases noted above are $419 million as of december 31, 2015, of which approximately $34 million will be paid during the next twelve months. payments under this lease agreement are included in the contractual obligations table below.
off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2015, moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities where moodys is the primary beneficiary, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. as such, moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships.

52   moodys 2015 10k non-gaap financial measures:
in addition to its reported results, moodys has included in this md&a certain adjusted results that the sec defines as non-gaap financial measures. management believes that such non-gaap financial measures, when read in conjunction with the companys reported results, can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period to period comparisons of the companys performance, facilitate comparisons to competitors operating results and can provide greater transparency to investors of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. these non-gaap measures, as defined by the company, are not necessarily comparable to similarly defined measures of other companies. furthermore, these non-gaap measures should not be viewed in isolation or used as a substitute for other gaap measures in assessing the operating performance or cash flows of the company. below are brief descriptions of the companys non-gaap financial measures accompanied by a reconciliation of the non-gaap measure to its most directly comparable gaap measure:
constant currency measures:
the company presents revenue growth on a constant currency basis because management deems this metric to be a useful measure of assessing the operations of the company in times of foreign exchange rate volatility. constant currency measures exclude the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on operating results. the company calculates the dollar impact of foreign exchange as the difference between the translation of its current period non-usd functional currency results using prior comparative period weighted average foreign exchange translation rates and current year as reported results. growth rates on a constant currency basis are determined based on the difference between current period revenue translated using prior period comparative weighted average exchange rates and prior period as reported results divided by prior as reported results. below is a reconciliation of the companys as reported revenue changes to the changes on a constant currency basis:

adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin:
the company presents adjusted operating income because management deems this metric to be a useful measure of assessing the operating performance of moodys, measuring the companys ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, and expand its business. adjusted operating income excludes depreciation and amortization as well as goodwill impairment charges because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of acquiring productive assets including goodwill. companies also have different methods of depreciating and amortizing productive assets as well as different methods of valuing goodwill. management believes that the exclusion of certain items, detailed in the reconciliation below, allows for a more meaningful comparison of the companys operating results from period to period and across companies. below is a reconciliation of the companys operating income and operating margin to adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin:

non-gaap diluted eps the company presents this non-gaap measure to exclude the impact of litigation settlements, legacy tax matters and the icra gain to allow for a more meaningful comparison of moodys diluted earnings per share from period to period. the impact of litigation settlement relates to two legal matters resolved in the first quarter of 2013. the legacy tax items are specific to the company resulting from the 2000 distribution. the icra gain resulted from the company acquiring a controlling interest in icra in 2014. management believes that the exclusion of certain items, detailed in the reconciliation below, allows for a more meaningful comparison of the companys diluted eps from period-to-period. below is a reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable u.s. gaap amount:

54   moodys 2015 10k recently issued accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers. this asu outlines a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. the company is currently evaluating its adoption options and the impact that adoption of this update will have on its consolidated financial statements. currently, the company believes this asu will have an impact on: i) the capitalization of certain contract implementation costs; ii) the accounting for certain software license and maintenance revenue in ma; iii) the accounting for certain revenue arrangements where vsoe is not available and iv) the accounting for contract acquisition costs. in august 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-14 revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606), deferral of the effective date which defers the effective date of the asu for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted up to the original effective date of december 15, 2016.
in april 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-05 customers accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. this asu provides guidance on accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement. in accordance with the asu, a cloud computing arrangement that contains a software license should be accounted for consistently with the acquisition of other software licenses. if no software license is present in the contract, the entity should account for the arrangement as a service contract. the company can elect to apply this asu either retrospectively or prospectively effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2015, and early adoption is permitted. the adoption of this asu in 2016 will not have a material impact on the companys financial statements.
in april 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-03,simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. this asu simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements and requires a company to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. amortization costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. the asu is effective retrospectively for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2015, and early adoption is permitted. the adoption of this asu will impact the presentation of debt issuance costs in the companys consolidated balance sheets. additionally, in august 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-15 presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements. this asu codifies that given the lack of authoritative guidance in asu 2015-03 regarding line-of-credit arrangements, the sec staff would not object to a company deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt costs ratably over the term of the arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.
in may 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-07 disclosures for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent). this asu removes the requirement to include investments in the fair value hierarchy for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share as a practical expedient. asu no. 2015-07 is effective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. the adoption of this asu will only impact the presentation of certain of the companys pension assets in the fair value hierarchy disclosures.
in september 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-16 simplifying the accounting for measurement-period adjustments in acquisition accounting. this asu requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. the amendments in this asu require that the acquirer record, in the same periods financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. asu no. 2015-16 is applied prospectively for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. the company does not believe the adoption of this asu will have a material impact on its financial statements.
in november 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-17 income taxes (topic 740): balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. this asu simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring all deferred income tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. this removes the requirement for the entity to determine whether the deferred tax is current or noncurrent for presentation in the balance sheet. asu no. 2015-17 is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016. the company has elected to adopt this asu in the first quarter of 2016 with the adoption affecting the presentation of the companys deferred tax assets and liabilities on its balance sheet.
in january 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-01 financial instruments  recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities (subtopic 825-10). the amendments in this asu update various aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosures relating to financial instruments. asu no. 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2017. the company is currently evaluating the impact of this asu on the companys financial statements.

overview of 2015
during the year ended december 31, 2015, total revenues were $914.1 million, an increase of approximately 25.2% over $730.0 million reported for the same period a year ago. our revenue grew in north america, europe and apac geographies both organically and through acquisitions. our performance remained strong across our key verticals, with the life sciences and healthcare vertical emerging rapidly and showing growth of 72.8% during the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the year ended december 31, 2014.
we remain committed to maintaining and improving a well-balanced portfolio of clients and seek to grow revenues from our existing clients by continually expanding the scope and size of our engagements, as well as by growing our key client base through business development efforts and strategic acquisitions. during 2015, we made progress in this strategy and increased the reach of our offerings, both geographically and across industry verticals. during 2015, our top five and top ten customers accounted for 32.6% and 43.8% of consolidated revenues, respectively.
29
we continued our growth through strategic acquisitions in 2015.  through the july 2015 acquisition of navigationarts we added approximately 90 u.s.-based design consultants to epam's headcount.  the addition of navigationarts enhances our digital consulting, architecture and content solutions practice. in november 2015, we acquired ags, establishing epam's presence in india with over 1,000 it professionals to enhance our software product development services and test automation services offerings.  we expect these investments in epam's strategic growth to result in expanded service offerings and abilities for our clients.
summary of results of operations and non-gaap financial measures the following table presents a summary of our results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:

net income                    84.5           9.2                69.6           9.5                62.0          11.2
for 2015, we reported results of operations consistent with the continued execution of our strategy. during 2015, our operating expenses increased in line with our increase in revenues as we continue to invest in our people, processes and infrastructure to support our goal to deliver high-quality offerings that meet the needs of our customers, differentiate our value proposition from that of our competition, and drive scale and growth.
the key highlights of our consolidated results for 2015 were as follows:
•   the european segment continued its strong performance, generating revenue growth of $101.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2015, or 33.8% over 2014;
•   revenue increased in all our key verticals in 2015 as compared to 2014, specifically within the software and hi-tech and travel and consumer verticals, which grew $35.0 million and $57.5 million respectively.
•   income from operations grew 23.0% during the year ended december 31, 2015, over 2014, while income from operations as a percentage of revenues decreased by 0.2%. the slight decrease was due to a combination of factors, including an increase of $21.2 million in stock-based compensation expense driven by increases in headcount and acquisitions.
•   net income increased by 21.3% during 2015 compared with 2014. expressed as a percentage of revenues, net income remained consistent despite the adverse effect of a higher effective tax rate and significant foreign exchange rate changes in 2015 as compared to 2014.
•   our organic growth was complemented by two strategic acquisitions completed during 2015, which expanded our highly skilled employee base, geographic footprint and service capabilities. through acquisitions, we added capabilities in digital design as well as a delivery center in india.
the operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period.
we have significant international operations, and we earn revenues and incur expenses in multiple currencies. when important to management's analysis, operating results are compared in "constant currency terms", a non-gaap financial measure that excludes the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. the effect of rate fluctuations is excluded by translating the current period's revenues and expenses into u.s. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates of the prior period of comparison. see item 7a, "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" of this report for a discussion of our exposure to exchange rates.

effects of inflation economies in cis countries, particularly belarus, russia, kazakhstan and ukraine, have periodically experienced high rates of inflation. periods of higher inflation may slow economic growth in those countries and as a result decrease demand for our services and negatively impact the business of our existing clients. inflation is likely to increase some of our expenses, which may reduce our profitability, as we may not be able to pass these increases on to our clients. generally, our largest expense that could be impacted by inflation is wages. we do not rely on borrowed funds for operations in those locations; therefore, increases in interest rates typical for inflationary environments do not currently pose a risk to our business.
ukraine has been experiencing political and economic turmoil with no improvement as of the date of this report, severely impacting the ukrainian economy. the ukrainian currency has been weakened and the negative outlook in the ukrainian economy continues. we have not seen a significant impact from the inflation in ukraine. additionally, we do not have clients located in ukraine.
inflation in russia increased late in 2014 due to weakening of the russian ruble and decreasing oil prices. during 2015, inflation in russia remained steady with some decline observed in recent months. our operations in russia have not been affected directly by local inflation; however, we have noted some decline in demand for our services by our clients in russia.
belarus has been experiencing hyperinflation over the last several years. the measures currently used by the belarusian government to control this recent inflation include monetary policy and pricing instruments, including increasing interest rates and the use of anti-monopoly laws to prevent the increase in pricing of goods, as well as privatization and using foreign borrowings to replenish the budget and stabilize the local currency. inflation, government actions to combat inflation and public speculation about possible additional actions have also contributed to economic uncertainty in belarus. belarus may experience high levels of inflation in the future. we have not seen a significant impact from the inflation in belarus as our largest expense there, wages, is denominated in u.s. dollars in order to provide stability in our business and for our employees. additionally, we do not have significant clients located in belarus and for the year ended december 31, 2015, we had approximately $1.5, or 0.2%, of our revenues denominated in belarusian rubles. the functional currency for financial reporting purposes in belarus is us dollars.
other locations where we have clients or perform services are not experiencing significant inflation and our business is not materially impacted by inflation in those locations.
periods of higher inflation may slow economic growth in those countries. inflation also is likely to increase some of our costs and expenses, which we may not be able to pass on to our clients and, as a result, may reduce our profitability. inflationary pressures could also affect our ability to access financial markets and lead to counter-inflationary measures that may harm our financial condition, results of operations or adversely affect the market price of our securities.

operating expenses cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)
the principal components of our cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) are salaries, employee benefits, stock compensation expense, travel costs and subcontractor fees for it professionals and subcontractors that are assigned to client projects. salaries and other compensation expenses of our it professionals are reported as cost of revenue regardless of whether the employees are actually performing client services during a given period.
we manage the utilization levels of our professionals through hiring and training high-performing it professionals and efficient staffing of projects. our staff utilization also depends on the general economy and its effect on our clients and their business decisions regarding the use of our services. some of our it professionals are specifically hired and trained to work for specific clients or on specific projects, and some of our offshore development centers are dedicated to specific clients or projects.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses represent expenses associated with promoting and selling our services and general administrative functions of our business. these expenses include senior management, administrative personnel and sales and marketing personnel salaries; stock compensation expense, related fringe benefits, commissions and travel costs for those employees; legal and audit expenses, insurance, operating lease expenses, and the cost of advertising and other promotional activities. in addition, we pay a membership fee of 1% of revenues collected in belarus to the administrative organization of the belarus hi-tech park.
our selling, general and administrative expenses have increased primarily as a result of our expanding operations, acquisitions, and the hiring of a number of senior managers to support our growth. we expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute terms as our business expands but will generally remain steady or slightly decrease as a percentage of our revenues.

provision for income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance, if any, involves judgment. as a global company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. during 2015, 2014 and 2013, we had $113.8 million, $94.2 million, $69.8 million, respectively, in income before provision for income taxes attributed to our foreign jurisdictions. the statutory tax rate in our foreign jurisdictions is lower than the statutory u.s. tax rate. additionally, we have secured special tax benefits in belarus as described below. as a result, our provision for income taxes is low in comparison to income before taxes because of the benefit received from increased income earned in low tax jurisdictions. the foreign tax rate differential represents this significant reduction. changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can also affect our overall effective income tax rate.
our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions, as well as the related net interest. tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, we cannot assure you that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from our current estimates. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, statute of limitation lapse or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
our subsidiary in belarus is a member of the belarus hi-tech park, in which member technology companies are 100% exempt from the current belarusian income tax rate of 18%. the "on high-technologies park" decree, which created the belarus hi-tech park, is in effect for a period of 15 years from july 1, 2006.

provision for income taxes the company's effective tax rate was 19.9% and 19.2% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the primary factors that caused this increase in the rate for the above-mentioned periods are: (a) the four acquisitions completed during 2014, which added other tax jurisdictions into the company's worldwide effective tax rate analysis; (b) a larger portion of the company's pre-tax profits attributable to tax jurisdictions with relatively higher effective tax rates (as compared to effective tax rates within the cis region) were seen in 2014 and (c) a relative shift in offshore services that were performed in belarus to other countries in the cis region (specifically ukraine and, to a lesser extent, russia). both of those locations have higher income tax rates than belarus, where the company is currently entitled to a 100% exemption from belarusian income tax.
results by business segment our operations consist of four reportable segments: north america, europe, russia and other. the segments represent components of epam for which separate financial information is available that is used on a regular basis by our chief executive officer, who is also our chief operating decision maker ("codm"), in determining how to allocate resources and evaluate performance. this determination is based on the unique business practices and market specifics of each region and that each region engages in business activities from which it earns revenues and incurs expenses. our reportable segments are based on managerial responsibility for a particular client. because managerial responsibility for a particular client relationship generally correlates with the client's geographic location, there is a high degree of similarity between client locations and the geographic boundaries of our reportable segments. in some specific cases, however, managerial responsibility for a particular client is assigned to a management team in another region, usually based on the strength of the relationship between client executives and particular members of our senior management team. in a case like this, the client's activity would be reported through the management team's reportable segment. our codm evaluates the company's performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit.
segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. generally, operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to similar factors, pressures and challenges. expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as an allocation of certain shared services expenses. we use globally integrated support organizations to realize economies of scale and efficient use of resources. as a result, a majority of our expenses is shared by all segments. these shared expenses include delivery, recruitment and development, sales and marketing, and support functions such as it, finance, legal, and human resources. generally, shared expenses are allocated based on measurable drivers of expense, e.g., recorded hours or headcount. however, certain expenses are not specifically allocated to specific segments, as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment. further, stock based compensation expense is not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker. accordingly, these expenses are separately disclosed as "unallocated" and adjusted only against our total income from operations.
revenues from external clients and segment operating profit, before unallocated expenses, for the north america, europe, russia and other reportable segments for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:

2015 compared to 2014
north america segment during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 revenues from our north america segment were 51.5% and 51.3% of total revenues representing an increase of $97.1 million, or 25.9%, over the corresponding period in 2014. the north america segment's operating profits increased by $21.7 million, or 23.9%, as compared to the same period of 2014, to $112.3 million net operating profit. north america remains our most profitable segment with operating profit composing 23.8% of revenues.
the increase in revenues during the year ended december 31, 2015, was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing top customer relationships, as well as our recent acquisitions. operating results of the north america operating segment benefited from our 2014 acquisitions in the life sciences and healthcare industry as well as acquisitions of navigationarts and ags during 2015.
europe segment during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, revenues from our europe segment were 43.8% and 41.0% of total segment revenues, respectively, representing an increase of $101.2 million, or 33.8%, in 2015 over the 2014 results. during 2015, the europe segment's operating profits increased by $18.5 million, or 36.9%, as compared to the corresponding period of 2014, to $68.7 million net profit from the segment's operations.
europe continues to be a growing segment in our portfolio as our business model continues to gain considerable traction with european-based clients primarily in the financial services and travel and consumer verticals. furthermore, our europe segment benefited from the continued growth of jointech, a company we acquired in 2014, with locations in south-east asia. this extended reach into a new geography created additional options for our existing customers within the financial services vertical, particularly in the areas of investment banking and wealth and asset management. we expect that our new and existing customers will use our services in that fast-growing region resulting in possible revenue and operating profit increases to the europe segment.
russia and other segments during the years ended december 31, 2015, revenues from the russia and the other operating segments decreased by $12.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively, over corresponding period of 2014. operating profits of the russia segment decreased $1.8 million and the operating losses of the other segment decreased $3.1 million when compared with the operating profits/ (losses) of these segments in the corresponding period of 2014.
revenues and operating profits in the russia and other segments are subject to volatility resulting from revenue recognition delays related to finalizing budgets for certain arrangements with major customers in those segments causing instability between revenues and associated profits. additionally, strong foreign currency fluctuations in 2014 further destabilized the economic situation in the regions that are included in these segments and negatively impacted our business in russia and cis countries during 2015. since 2014, the united states and the european union have imposed sanctions targeting russian government and government-controlled interests and certain government officials. while this has not directly impacted our business in russia, the sanctions aggravated the overall russian economy and negatively influenced the business of our major clients in the region, decreasing demand for our services.
2014 compared to 2013
north america segment during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, revenues from our north america segment were 51.3% and 51.3% of total revenues representing an increase of $89.9 million, or 31.6%, over the corresponding period in 2013. the north america segment's operating profits increased by $23.8 million, or 35.6%, as compared to the same period of 2013, to $90.6 million net operating profit.
the increase in revenues during the year ended december 31, 2014, was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships, as well, as our recent acquisitions. the largest growth was in the other vertical due to acquiring new clients in the healthcare, insurance and life sciences industries through a 2014 acquisition as well as creating synergies with existing customers in those markets. during the year ended december 31, 2014, combined revenue growth from customers in the other vertical accounted for $34.8 million, representing a 97.4% growth over prior year.
40
all other verticals in the north america segment experienced revenue growth and increases in operating profit in 2014 as compared to 2013, mainly due to increased business from our long-term clients with some contribution from the clients acquired in connection with acquisitions. the largest vertical, the isvs and technology, grew revenues by $22.1 million, or 18.6%, in 2014 as compared to the corresponding period of 2013. revenues from our travel and consumer vertical in 2014 increased by $14.6 million, or 26.7%, as compared to the corresponding period in 2013. banking and financial services had an increase in revenue of $5.9 million or 45.4%, and operating profit increased by 104.9% in this vertical in 2014 compared with the year ended december 31, 2013. business information and media grew in revenue $12.5 million or 20% for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013.
europe segment during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, revenues from our europe segment were 41.0% and 36.8% of total segment revenues, respectively, representing an increase of $95.1 million, or 46.6%, in 2014 over the 2013 results. during 2014, the europe segment's operating profits increased by $15.6 million, or 45.2%, as compared to the corresponding period of 2013, to $50.2 million net profit from the segment's operations.
europe continues to be a rapidly growing segment in our portfolio, given our nearshore delivery capabilities, and our value proposition in delivering quality software engineering solutions and services. our business model continues to gain considerable traction with european-based clients primarily in the banking and financial services and travel and consumer verticals. furthermore, our europe segment benefited from the acquisition of jointech, a company with locations in south-east asia, which created a new value proposition for our existing customers within the banking and financial services vertical, particularly in the areas of investment banking, wealth and asset management, and extended our reach into new geography. we expect that many of our new and existing customers in other business verticals will use our services in that fast-growing region resulting in possible revenue and operating profit increases to the europe segment.
russia and other segments during the years ended december 31, 2014, revenues from the russia and other operating segments decreased by $5.1 million and $4.9 million, respectively, over corresponding period of 2013. operating profits of the russia segment showed no changes when compared with the operating profits of this segment in 2013, while profits of other segments decreased $4.1 million compared to 2013.
revenues and operating profits in the russia and other segments are subject to volatility resulting from revenue recognition delays related to finalizing budgets for certain arrangements with major customers in those segments. as a result, we recorded the cost related to the performance of services in 2014 with no associated revenues recognized in the period that services were rendered. these business arrangements were further exacerbated by strong foreign currency fluctuations in the fourth quarter of 2014, negatively impacting our business in russia and cis countries.

liquidity and capital resources capital resources at december 31, 2015, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $199.4 million, a one-year time deposit maturing in march 2016 in the amount of $30.0 million and $65.0 million of available borrowings under our revolving line of credit. as of that date, $181.9 million of our total cash and cash equivalents was held outside the united states. of this amount, $79.3 million was held in u.s. dollar denominated accounts in belarus, including deposits that accrued interest at an average interest rate of 4.8% during 2015.
in 2014 we repatriated $75.8 million u.s. dollars from belarus into our cyprus entity's bank in the united kingdom. in march 2015, $30.0 million of this amount has been placed into a one-year interest bearing time deposit within the same bank. as of december 31, 2015, the remaining unrestricted balance of $28.7 million u.s. dollars is kept in a savings account in our cyprus entity's bank in the united kingdom.
our subsidiaries in the cis or apac regions do not maintain significant balances denominated in currencies other than u.s. dollars.
the cash and cash equivalents held at locations outside of the united states are for future operating expenses and we have no intention of repatriating those funds. however, as a result of various factors such as any global or regional instability or changes in tax laws in place for a specific time period, we may later decide to repatriate some or all of our funds to the united states. if we decide to remit funds to the united states in the form of dividends, $212.1 million would be subject to foreign withholding taxes, of which $184.0 million would also be subject to u.s. corporate income tax. we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents held in the united states and cash flow to be generated from domestic operations will be adequate to satisfy our domestic liquidity needs in the foreseeable future. our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans and to meet our long-term capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash flows increase, our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from outside of the u.s. and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. to the extent we pursue one or more significant strategic acquisitions, we may incur debt or sell additional equity to finance those acquisitions.
on september 12, 2014, we established a revolving credit facility with pnc bank, national association; santander bank, n.a; and silicon valley bank. this credit facility consists of a $100.0 million revolving line of credit, with a maturity date of september 12, 2019. there is potential to increase the credit facility up to $200.0 million if certain conditions are met. borrowings under the 2014 credit facility may be denominated in united states dollars or, up to a maximum of $50.0 million in british pounds sterling, canadian dollars, euros or swiss francs (or other currencies as may be approved by the lenders). at december 31, 2015, we had outstanding debt of $35.0 million with the balance of the credit limit of $65.0 million remaining available for use.

operating activities net cash provided by operations during the year ended december 31, 2015 decreased $28.5 million to $76.4 million, as compared to $104.9 million net cash provided by operations in 2014. during 2015, operating cash flows were impacted by increases in billed and unbilled accounts receivable and greater accrued expenses, which were mostly impacted by increases in bonus compensation. during 2015 we have recorded more accounts receivable and unbilled revenue as compared to the same period in 2014. the increases in billed and unbilled receivables are consistent with our growth in revenue and the majority of unbilled receivables are current with nearly 60% recorded in december 2015 and over 90% recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015.
net cash provided by operations during the year ended december 31, 2014 increased $46.6 million to $104.9 million, as compared to $58.2 million net cash provided by operations in 2013. during 2014, operating cash flows benefited, in part, from our strong focus on improving working capital efficiencies during the latter part of 2013, including focus on reducing days outstanding for our billed and unbilled receivables. this emphasis more than offset the higher working capital requirements associated with increased revenues, including growth in total compensation and benefits of our it professionals, overhead expenses, and higher tax payments.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2015 was $125.5 million and consisted primarily of a $30.0 million interest bearing time deposit set up by our cyprus entity in the united kingdom in march 2015 and $76.9 million net cash used in the business combinations with navigationarts and ags. the cash spent on acquisitions of businesses in 2015 increased $39.8 million compared to 2014.
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2014 increased $31.1 million to $52.9 million as compared to $21.8 million used in investing activities during the corresponding period of 2013. the increase was primarily attributable to $37.1 million spent on acquisitions of businesses, partially offset by a net $6.2 million decrease in loans issued under the employee housing program compared to the corresponding period last year.
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december 31, 2015 was $33.8 million, a decrease of $23.4 million from the same period in 2014 primarily due to payment of deferred consideration in the amount of $30 million as well as a decrease in excess tax benefit on stock-based compensation plans, partly offset by higher proceeds from stock option exercises.
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december 31, 2014 was $10.3 million, a decrease of $5.2 million from the same period in 2013 primarily due to payment of deferred consideration in the amount of $4 million as well as a decrease in excess tax benefit on stock-based compensation plans, partly offset by higher proceeds from stock option exercises.

during the year ended december 31, 2015, the company completed construction of the office building within the high technologies park in minsk, belarus, and, therefore, no future capital requirements exist related to this construction. see note 15 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k for further information.
future capital requirements
43
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents combined with our expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and that we possess the financial flexibility to execute our strategic objectives, including the ability to make acquisitions and strategic investments in the foreseeable future. our ability to generate cash, however, is subject to our performance, general economic conditions, industry trends and other factors. to the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents and operating cash flow are insufficient to fund our future activities and requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. if we issue equity securities in order to raise additional funds, substantial dilution to existing stockholders may occur. if we raise cash through the issuance of additional indebtedness, we may be subject to additional contractual restrictions on our business. there is no assurance that we would be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all.
off-balance sheet commitments and arrangements we do not have any obligations under guarantee contracts or other contractual arrangements other than as disclosed in note 15 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k. we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities where we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to us, or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services with us.
44
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), which require us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect: (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, (ii) disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period and (iii) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. we evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions, and expectations regarding the future based on available information and reasonable assumptions, which together form a basis for making judgments about matters not readily apparent from other sources. since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. when reviewing our audited consolidated financial statements, you should consider (i) our selection of critical accounting policies, (ii) the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies and (iii) the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions. we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application places significant demands on the judgment of our management.
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. we believe that the following critical accounting policies are the most sensitive and require more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. you should read the following descriptions of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this annual report.
revenue recognition - we recognize revenue when realized or realizable and earned, which is when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. if there is an uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. at the time revenues are recognized, we provide for any contractual deductions and reduce revenues accordingly. we defer amounts billed to our clients for revenues not yet earned. such amounts are anticipated to be recorded as revenues as services are performed in subsequent periods. unbilled revenues represent services provided which are billed subsequent to the period end in accordance with the contract terms.
we derive our revenues from a variety of service offerings, which represent specific competencies of our it professionals. contracts for these services have different terms and conditions based on the scope, deliverables, and complexity of the engagement, which require management to make judgments and estimates in determining appropriate revenue recognition pattern. fees for these contracts may be in the form of time-and-materials or fixed-price arrangements.
the majority of our revenues (85.8% of revenues in 2015, 84.7% in 2014 and 82.3% in 2013) are generated under time-and-material contracts whereby revenues are recognized as services are performed with the corresponding cost of providing those services reflected as cost of revenues when incurred. the majority of such revenues are billed on an hourly, daily or monthly basis whereby actual time is charged directly to the client.
revenues from fixed-price contracts (12.8% of revenues in 2015, 13.6% in 2014 and 15.7% in 2013) are determined using the proportional performance method. in instances where final acceptance of the product, system, or solution is specified by the client, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. in absence of a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenue is recognized upon receipt of final acceptance from the client. in order to estimate the amount of revenue for the period under the proportional performance method, we determine the percentage of actual labor hours incurred as compared to estimated total labor hours and apply that percentage to the consideration allocated to the deliverable. the complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements. a number of internal and external factors can affect such estimates, including labor hours and specification and testing requirement changes. the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known. no significant revisions occurred in each of the three years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. our fixed price contracts are generally recognized over a period of 12 months or less.
we report gross reimbursable "out-of-pocket" expenses incurred as both revenues and cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income as these expenses are billable to our clients.
45
business combinations - we account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method, which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the fasb asc topic 805, "business combinations." we identify and attribute fair values and estimated lives to the intangible assets acquired and allocate the total cost of an acquisition to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values. determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and involves the use of significant estimates, including projections of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples. there are different valuation models for each component, the selection of which requires considerable judgment. these determinations will affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods. we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe are reasonable, but recognize that the assumptions are inherently uncertain.
if initial accounting for the business combination has not been completed by the end of the reporting period in which the business combination occurs, provisional amounts are reported for which the accounting is incomplete, with retrospective adjustment made to such provisional amounts during the measurement period to present new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. once the measurement period ends, and in no case beyond one year from the acquisition date, revisions of the accounting for the business combination are recorded in earnings.
all acquisition-related costs, other than the costs to issue debt or equity securities, are accounted for as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. changes in fair value of contingent consideration arrangements that are not measurement period adjustments are recognized in earnings. payments to settle contingent consideration, if any, are reflected in cash flows from financing activities and the changes in fair value are reflected in cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
the acquired assets typically consist of customer relationships, trade names, non-competition agreements, and workforce and as a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets.
goodwill and other intangible assets - goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are treated consistently with fasb asc 350, "intangibles - goodwill and other." we do not have any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
we assess goodwill for impairment annually, and more frequently in certain circumstances. events or circumstances that might require impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets include the loss of a significant client, the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit, loss of key personnel, the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit, significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations. we initially perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill to test for impairment indicators. after applying the qualitative assessment, if we conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount; the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required.
if we determine that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, we perform a quantitative impairment test. if an indicator of impairment is identified, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is compared to its carrying amount, and the impairment loss is measured by the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. the fair values are estimated using a combination of the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method, and the market approach, which incorporates the use of earnings multiples based on market data. these valuations are considered level 3 measurements under fasb asc topic 820. we utilize estimates to determine the fair value of the reporting units such as future cash flows, growth rates, capital requirements, effective tax rates and projected margins, among other factors. estimates utilized in the future evaluations of goodwill for impairment could differ from estimates used in the current period calculations. we are also required to assess the goodwill of its reporting units for impairment between annual assessment dates as events or circumstances dictate. based on our assessment, these operating segments are not at risk for impairment.
intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. when facts and circumstances indicate potential impairment of amortizable intangible assets, we evaluate the recoverability of the asset's carrying value, using estimates of future cash flows that utilize a discount rate determined by the management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model over the remaining asset life. the estimates of future cash flows attributable to intangible assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results. any impairment loss is measured by the excess of carrying value over fair value. all of our intangible assets have finite lives.
effective in the fourth quarter of 2013, we changed the annual goodwill impairment assessment date for all of our reporting units from december 31st to october 31st, which represented a voluntary change in the annual goodwill impairment testing date.
46
income taxes - the provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local and foreign taxes. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of changes. we evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognize a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
the realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future earnings. any reduction in estimated forecasted results may require that we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. once a valuation allowance has been established, it will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. a pattern of sustained profitability will generally be considered as sufficient positive evidence to reverse a valuation allowance. if the allowance is reversed in a future period, the income tax provision will be correspondingly reduced. accordingly, the increase and decrease of valuation allowances could have a significant negative or positive impact on future earnings.
stock-based compensation - equity-based compensation cost relating to the issuance of share-based awards to employees is based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant, which is expensed ratably over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures. over time, the forfeiture assumption is adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate and such change may affect the timing of the total amount of expense recognized over the vesting period. equity-based awards that do not require future service are expensed immediately. equity-based awards that do not meet the criteria for equity classification are recorded as liabilities and adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period.

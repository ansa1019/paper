item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition. our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material.
overview operating overview operating results for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014 are as follows:
•   equivalent production in 2015 increased 70.7 bcfe, or 13%, from 531.8 bcfe, or 1.5 bcfe per day, in 2014 to 602.5 bcfe, or 1.7 bcfe per day, in 2015.
•   natural gas production increased 57.9 bcf, or 11%, from 508.0 bcf in 2014 to 566.0 bcf in 2015, primarily the result of higher production in the marcellus shale associated with our drilling program in pennsylvania.
•   crude oil/condensate/ngl production increased 2.1 mmbbls, or 54%, from 4.0 mmbbls in 2014 to 6.1 mmbbls in 2015, as a result of higher production associated with our oil-focused eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas and production associated with the south texas asset acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2014.
•   average realized natural gas price for 2015 was $2.15 per mcf, 34% lower than the $3.28 per mcf price realized in 2014.
•   average realized crude oil price for 2015 was $45.72 per bbl, 48% lower than the $88.50 per bbl price realized in 2014.
•   drilled 142 gross wells (132.8 net) with a success rate of 100.0% in 2015 compared to 200 gross wells (176.5 net) with a success rate of 99.5% in 2014.
•   total capital spending was approximately $776.9 in 2015 compared to $1.6 billion (excluding the south texas asset acquisitions) in 2014.
•   average rig count during 2015 was approximately 3.5 rigs in the marcellus shale and approximately 1.9 rigs in the eagle ford shale, compared to an average rig count in the marcellus shale of approximately 6.0 rigs and approximately 2.8 rigs in the eagle ford shale during 2014.
market conditions and commodity prices our financial results depend on many factors, particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms. commodity prices are affected by many factors outside of our control, including changes in market supply and demand, which are impacted by weather conditions, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors. in addition, our realized prices are further impacted by our derivative and hedging activities. as a result, we cannot accurately predict future commodity prices and, therefore, we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases in these prices will have on our capital program, production volumes or revenues. location differentials have increased in certain regions, such as in the appalachian region, resulting in further declines in natural gas prices. we expect natural gas and crude oil prices to remain volatile. in addition to production volumes and commodity prices, finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas and crude oil reserves at economical costs are critical to our long-term success. see "risk factors-natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely, and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business" and "risk factors-our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable" in item 1a.
we account for our derivative instruments on a mark-to-market basis with changes in fair value recognized in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations. as a result of these mark-to-market adjustments associated with our derivative instruments, we will likely experience volatility in our earnings due to commodity price volatility. refer to "impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues" below and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
commodity prices continued to decline during 2015 compared to 2014. as a result of the continued decline in commodity prices, we tested the recoverability of the carrying value of all of our oil and gas properties and recorded an impairment charge of approximately $114.9 million associated with certain non-core fields in south texas, east texas and louisiana. based on the results of our impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2015, we do not believe that further impairment of our oil and gas
37
properties is reasonably likely to occur in the near future; however, in the event that commodity prices significantly decline from current levels, additional impairments of our oil and gas properties may be required.
we believe we are well-positioned to manage the challenges presented in the lower commodity pricing environment, and we can endure the current cyclical downturn in the oil and gas industry and the continued volatility in current and future commodity prices by:
•   continuing to exercise discipline in our capital program by reducing our capital expenditures and number of wells drilled compared to the prior year.
•   continuing to optimize our drilling, completion and operational efficiencies, resulting in lower operating costs per unit of production.
•   continuing to manage our balance sheet with sufficient availability under our revolving credit facility to meet our capital requirements and maintain compliance with our debt covenants.
•   continuing to manage price risk by strategically hedging our natural gas and crude oil production.
financial condition capital resources and liquidity our primary sources of cash in 2015 were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and oil production and net borrowings under our revolving credit facility. these cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital expenditures (including contributions to our equity method investments), interest payments on debt and payment of dividends. see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow.
effective april 17, 2015, we amended our revolving credit facility to extend the maturity date from may 2017 to april 2020 and to change the mechanism under which interest rate margins are determined for outstanding borrowings. the revolving credit facility, as amended, provides for a borrowing base of $3.4 billion and commitments of $1.8 billion. the amended credit facility also provides for an accordion feature, which allows us to increase the available credit line up to an additional $500 million if one or more of the existing or new banks agree to provide such increased amount. the borrowing base is redetermined annually under the terms of the revolving credit facility on april 1. in addition, either we or the banks may request an interim redetermination twice a year or in conjunction with certain acquisitions or sales of oil and gas properties.
due to the significant decrease in natural gas and crude oil prices during 2015 and the related impact on certain of our financial covenants, effective december 31, 2015, we amended the agreements governing our senior notes and revolving credit facility to adjust certain financial covenants and to include an additional financial covenant. in addition, the amendments to our senior notes provide for potential increases in coupon rates ranging from 0 to 125 basis points depending on the asset coverage and leverage ratios at the end of the respective quarterly period. in addition, the amendment to our revolving credit facility increased the maximum margins we pay on borrowings under the credit facility. see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding the amendments.
as a result of the recent decline in commodity prices, our borrowing base and related commitments under the revolving credit facility could be reduced in the future. unless commodity prices continue to decline significantly from current levels, we do not believe that any such reductions would have a significant impact on our ability to service our debt and fund our drilling program and related operations.
we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity. our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt. management believes that, with internally generated cash flow and availability under our revolving credit facility, we have the capacity to finance our spending plans.
at december 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $413.0 million and $140.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, respectively. as of december 31, 2015, we had unused commitments of $1.4 billion under our revolving credit facility.
we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants, as amended, for both the revolving credit facility and senior notes as of december 31, 2015. see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our debt.

cash flows our cash flows from operations, investing activities and financing activities are as follows:
year ended december 31,
(in thousands)                                                      2015   2014                      2013
cash flows provided by operating activities                $740,737                $1,236,435                $1,024,526
cash flows used in investing activities                    (993,334    )           (1,664,840    )             (918,207    )
cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities       232,157                   425,959                  (113,655    )
net decrease in cash and cash equivalents                  $(20,440    )              $(2,446    )              $(7,336    )
operating activities. operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes and operating expenses. prices for natural gas and crude oil have historically been volatile, including demand for natural gas and crude oil, pipeline infrastructure constraints and seasonal influences. in addition, fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital spending.
our working capital is substantially influenced by the variables discussed above and fluctuates based on the timing and amount of borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility, the timing of cash collections and payments on our trade accounts receivable and payable, respectively, and changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative activity. from time to time, our working capital will reflect a deficit, while at other times it will reflect a surplus. this fluctuation is not unusual. at december 31, 2015 and 2014, we had working capital deficits of $90.8 million and $85.6 million, respectively. we believe we have adequate availability under our revolving credit facility and liquidity available to meet our working capital requirements.
net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 decreased by $495.7 million when compared to 2014. this decrease was primarily due to lower operating revenues and higher operating expenses (excluding non-cash expenses), partially offset by favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities. the decrease in operating revenues was primarily due to a decrease in realized natural gas and crude oil prices, partially offset by an increase in equivalent production. average realized natural gas and crude oil prices decreased by 34% and 48%, respectively, for 2015 compared to 2014. equivalent production volumes increased by 13% for 2015 over 2014 as a result of higher natural gas production in the marcellus shale and higher oil production in the eagle ford shale.
net cash provided by operating activities in 2014 increased by $211.9 million over 2013. this increase was primarily due to higher operating revenues, partially offset by higher operating expenses (excluding non-cash expenses) and an increase in working capital. the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production, partially offset by a decrease in realized natural gas and crude oil prices. equivalent production volumes increased by 29% for 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of higher natural gas in the marcellus shale and oil production in the eagle ford shale. average realized natural gas and crude oil prices decreased by 8% and 12%, respectively, for 2014 compared to 2013.
see "results of operations" for additional information relative to commodity price, production and operating expense fluctuations. we are unable to predict future commodity prices and, as a result, cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities.
investing activities. cash flows used in investing activities decreased by $671.5 million from 2014 to 2015 due to a decrease of $524.0 million in capital expenditures, $198.4 million lower acquisition costs and a $9.0 million decrease in capital contributions associated with our equity method investments. these decreases were partially offset by a $31.8 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets and $28.1 million of changes in restricted cash balances.
cash flows used in investing activities increased by $746.6 million from 2013 to 2014 due to an increase of $284.9 million in capital expenditures, a decrease of $284.0 million in proceeds from the sale of assets, a $214.7 million increase in acquisition expenditures related to the acquisitions of eagle ford shale assets that closed in the fourth quarter of 2014, and a $19.2 million increase in capital contributions associated with our equity method investments. partially offsetting the increases was a $56.2 million decrease in restricted cash related to the release of funds by our qualified intermediary due to a lapse in the statutory holding period and the funding of oil and gas lease acquisitions during 2014 associated with like-kind exchange transactions pursuant to section 1031 of the internal revenue code.
financing activities. cash flows provided by financing activities decreased by $193.8 million from 2014 to 2015 due to $332.0 million of lower net borrowings and an increase in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of $2.2 million related to the amendment of our credit facility in april 2015. these decreases were partially offset by lower treasury stock repurchases
39
of $138.9 million as no shares were repurchased in 2015 and a decrease of $1.4 million in tax benefits associated with our stock-based compensation.
cash flows provided by financing activities increased by $539.6 million from 2013 to 2014 due to $545.0 million of higher net borrowings and a decrease in share repurchases of $25.8 million, partially offset by a decrease of $20.3 million in tax benefits associated with our stock-based compensation, an $8.0 million increase in dividends paid and an increase in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of $2.9 million.

in 2015, we did not repurchase any shares of common stock. for the year ended december 31, 2014, we repurchased 4.3 million shares for a total cost of $138.9 million. during 2015 and 2014, we also paid dividends of $33.1 million ($0.08 per share) and $33.3 million ($0.08 per share) on our common stock, respectively.
capital and exploration expenditures on an annual basis, we generally fund most of our capital expenditures, excluding any significant property acquisitions, with cash generated from operations and, if required, borrowings under our revolving credit facility. we budget these expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year. in 2015, capital expenditures exceeded our cash flow from operations, requiring us to fund a portion of our capital expenditures through borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures:

_______________________________________________________________________________
(1) exploration expenditures include $3.3 million, $7.8 million and $0.4 million of exploratory dry hole expenditures in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
we plan to drill approximately 30 gross wells (30.0 net) in 2016 compared to 142 gross wells (132.8 net) drilled in 2015. in 2016, our drilling program includes approximately $325.0 million in total capital expenditures. we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment along with our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital
40
expenditures accordingly. due to the current commodity price environment, our overall capital spending in 2016 is expected to be lower than our expenditures in 2015.
contractual obligations we have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations. a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2015 are set forth in the following table:

(1)   interest payments have been calculated utilizing the rates associated with our senior notes outstanding at december 31, 2015. interest payments on our revolving credit facility were calculated by assuming that the december 31, 2015 outstanding balance of $413.0 million will be outstanding through the april 2020 maturity date and that our senior notes will remain outstanding through their respective maturity dates. a constant interest rate of 2.5% was assumed for the interest payments on our revolving credit facility, which was the december 31, 2015 weighted-average interest rate. actual results will differ from these estimates and assumptions.

(3)   for further information on our equity investment contribution commitments, see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
amounts related to our asset retirement obligation are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures. the total amount of our asset retirement obligation at december 31, 2015 was $145.6 million. see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
we have no off-balance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations.
potential impact of our critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, which is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the related disclosures of assets and liabilities. the following accounting policies are our most critical policies requiring more significant judgments and estimates. we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. actual results could differ from those estimates.
successful efforts method of accounting we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred. judgment is required to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory, which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of costs incurred. exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed. development costs, including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized.
41
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. the process relies on interpretations and judgment of available geological, geophysical, engineering and production data. the extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. the process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the sec, such as natural gas and crude oil prices. additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves and can change substantially over time. periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary as a result of reservoir performance, drilling activity, commodity prices, fluctuations in operating expenses, technological advances, new geological or geophysical data or other economic factors. accordingly, reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities ultimately recovered. we cannot predict the amounts or timing of such future revisions.
our reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller and lents, independent petroleum engineers, who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate. for more information regarding reserve estimation, including historical reserve revisions, refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8.
our rate of recording depreciation, depletion and amortization (dd&a) expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves, which are utilized in our unit-of-production calculation. if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced, the rate at which we record dd&a expense would increase, reducing net income. such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields. a 5% positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of $0.04 per mcfe and an increase of $0.05 per mcfe, respectively, on our dd&a rate. revisions in significant fields may individually affect our dd&a rate. it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10% in one of our most productive fields would result in a decrease of $0.05 per mcfe and an increase of $0.06 per mcfe, respectively, on our total dd&a rate. these estimated impacts are based on current data, and actual events could require different adjustments to our dd&a rate.
in addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards. due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process, risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis, management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future. based on the results of our impairment test of all of our oil and gas properties and the resulting impairment charge of approximately $114.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, we do not believe that further impairment of our oil and gas properties is reasonably likely to occur in the near future; however, in the event that commodity prices significantly decline from current levels, additional impairments of our oil and gas properties may be required.
carrying value of oil and gas properties we evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a field-by-field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset. if the future undiscounted expected cash flows, based on our estimate of future natural gas and crude oil prices, operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, are lower than the net book value of the asset, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process, historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials, as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices. in the event that commodity prices significantly decline, management would test the recoverability of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties and, if necessary, record an impairment charge. fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows. the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oil.
unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience, our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives. average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights. historically, the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years. the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling. we have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage, especially in exploratory areas. if the average unproved property life
42
decreases or increases by one year, the amortization would increase by approximately $10.5 million or decrease by approximately $8.0 million, respectively, per year.
as these properties are developed and reserves are proved, the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion. if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful, the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made. the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program.
asset retirement obligations the majority of our asset retirement obligations (aro) relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells and to a lesser extent meter stations, pipelines, processing plants and compressors. we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred, with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs, timing of settlements, inflation rates and discount rate. in periods subsequent to initial measurement, the asset retirement cost is depreciated using the units-of-production method, while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time (accretion expense) are reflected as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense.
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities under applicable accounting standards, the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet. at the end of each quarterly period, these instruments are marked-to-market. the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges and the ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded as a component of operating revenues in gain (loss) on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations. the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that are effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheet.
our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties. such quotes have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil, basis differentials, volatility factors and interest rates, such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term, as applicable. these estimates are verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness. the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for non-performance risk. we measure the non-performance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions, while our non-performance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks.
our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments due to volatility of natural gas and crude oil prices, both nymex and basis differentials.
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. these estimates and judgments include the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that we have taken. we account for the uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position. the amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect management's estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertainties.
we believe all of our deferred tax assets, net of any valuation allowances, will ultimately be realized, taking into consideration our forecasted future taxable income, which includes consideration of future operating conditions specifically related to commodity prices. if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision could increase in the period it is determined that it is more likely than not it will not be realized.
our effective tax rate is subject to variability as a result of factors other than changes in federal and state tax rates and/or changes in tax laws which could affect us. our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the allocation of property, payroll and revenues among states in which we operate. a small change in our estimated future tax rate could have a material effect on current period earnings.

contingency reserves a provision for contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost is estimable. the establishment of a reserve is based on an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management. in certain cases, management's judgment is based on the advice and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors, the interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and courts of laws, our experience and the experiences of other companies dealing with similar matters, and our decision on how we intend to respond to a particular matter. actual losses can differ from estimates for various reasons, including those noted above. we monitor known and potential legal, environmental and other contingencies and make our best estimate based on the information we have. future changes in facts and circumstances not currently foreseeable could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and amounts accrued.
stock-based compensation we account for stock-based compensation under the fair value method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards. under the fair value method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equity-classified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liability-classified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period, which is generally the vesting period. to calculate fair value, we use either a monte carlo or black-scholes valuation model, as determined by the specific provisions of the award. the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life, volatility and other factors. stock-based compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stock-based compensation.
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in november 2015, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update (asu) no. 2015-17, balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. the amendments in this update require deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent. the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016, however early adoption is allowed. this update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. we elected to early adopt this standard on a prospective basis and, as a result, there have been no adjustments made to prior periods. the adoption of this guidance only affected our financial position and did not have an impact on our results of operations or cash flows.
recently issued accounting pronouncements in march 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-03, simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. the amendments in this update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update. in august 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-15, presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements. the update provides authoritative guidance for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, noting the sec staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2015. we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers, as a new topic, accounting standards codification topic 606. the new revenue recognition standard provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. the core principle of the guidance is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. in august 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-14, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606), which deferred the effective date of asu no. 2014-09 by one year, making the new standard effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2017. this asu can be adopted either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption; however, entities reporting under u.s. gaap are not permitted to adopt the standard earlier than the original effective date for public entities (that is, no earlier than 2017 for calendar year-end entities). we are currently evaluating the effect that adopting this guidance will have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

other issues and contingencies regulations. our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal, state and local authorities. see "regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production," "natural gas marketing, gathering and transportation," "federal regulation of swap transactions," "federal regulation of petroleum," "pipeline safety regulation," and "environmental and safety regulations" in the "other business matters" section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations.
restrictive covenants. our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments. due to the significant decrease in oil and natural gas prices during 2015 and the related impact on certain of our financial covenants, effective december 31, 2015, we amended the agreements governing our senior notes and revolving credit facility to adjust certain financial covenants and to include an additional financial covenant. among other requirements, our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of consolidated cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 2.8 to 1.0, a minimum asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves before income taxes plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of 1.25 to 1.0, which increases back to the pre-amended ratio of 1.75 to 1.0 beginning on january 1, 2018, and a leverage ratio of debt to consolidated ebitdax of 4.75 to 1.0. through and including december 31, 2016. under the terms of the respective agreements, the leverage ratio will be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.0 through and including december 31, 2017 and 3.5 to 1.0 beginning on march 31, 2018 or until we maintain a leverage ratio below 3.0 to 1.0 for two consecutive fiscal quarters on or after december 31, 2017 or we receive an investment grade rating by standard & poor's ratings services (s&p) or moody's investor service, inc. (moody's), at which time we will no longer be subject to this covenant. our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum current ratio of 1.0 to 1.0. at december 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement.
operating risks and insurance coverage. our business involves a variety of operating risks. see "risk factors-we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses" in item 1a. in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience, the areas in which we operate and market conditions.
commodity pricing and risk management activities. our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil. further declines in natural gas and crude oil prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. lower natural gas and crude oil prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can produce economically. historically, natural gas and crude oil prices have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results. in particular, substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our oil and gas properties or a violation of certain financial debt covenants. because our reserves are predominantly natural gas (approximately 96% of equivalent proved reserves), changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices.
the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices. generally, if the related commodity index declines, the price that we receive for our production will also decline. furthermore, we have experienced widening basis differentials in certain regions, such as in the appalachian region, resulting in further declines in natural gas prices. therefore, the amount of revenue that we realize is determined by certain factors that are beyond our control. however, management may mitigate this price risk on a portion of our anticipated production with the use of commodity derivatives. most recently, we have used commodity derivatives such as collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue. under both arrangements, there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions.
results of operations
2015 and 2014 compared we reported a net loss for 2015 of $113.9 million, or $0.28 per share, compared to net income for 2014 of $104.5 million, or $0.25 per share. the decrease in net income was primarily due to lower operating revenues, higher operating and interest expenses and a decrease in gain on sale of assets. these decreases were partially offset by lower impairments on oil and gas properties.

natural gas revenues the decrease in natural gas revenues of $565.6 million was due to lower natural gas prices, partially offset by higher production associated with the positive results of our marcellus shale drilling program in pennsylvania.
crude oil and condensate revenues the decrease in crude oil and condensate revenues of $65.7 million was due to lower crude oil prices, partially offset by higher production. the increase in production was a result of our oil-focused eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas and production associated with the south texas assets acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014.
gain (loss) on derivative instruments effective april 1, 2014, we elected to discontinue hedge accounting on a prospective basis. subsequent to april 1, 2014, our derivative instruments were accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. changes in fair value and cash settlements of derivative instruments are recognized in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations.

total costs and expenses from operations decreased by $629.2 million from 2014 to 2015. the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows:
•   direct operations decreased $4.7 million largely due to cost reductions from suppliers, improved operational efficiencies and lower workover and plugging and abandonment expenses in 2015 compared to 2014. these decreases were partially offset by higher operating costs associated with the south texas assets acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014.
•   transportation and gathering increased $78.3 million due to higher throughput as a result of higher marcellus shale production, higher transportation rates and the commencement of various transportation and gathering agreements throughout 2014.
•   brokered natural gas decreased $17.4 million from 2014 to 2015. see the preceding table titled "brokered natural gas" for further analysis.
•   taxes other than income decreased $4.2 million due to $5.9 million lower production taxes resulting from lower crude oil and condensate revenues and $0.8 million lower drilling impact fees due to a decrease in our marcellus shale drilling activities. these decreases were partially offset by $2.0 million higher ad valorem taxes due to increased activity and the assets acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014 in south texas and $0.6 million higher franchise taxes.
•   exploration decreased $1.3 million as a result of lower exploratory dry hole costs of $4.5 million and $2.4 million lower geophysical and geological and other exploration expenses due to reduced activity. these decreases were partially offset by a $5.1 million charge related to the release of certain drilling rig contracts in south texas in the first half of 2015.
•   depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $10.5 million, of which $117.3 million was due to a lower dd&amp;a rate of $0.93 per mcfe for 2015 compared to $1.13 per mcfe for 2014, partially offset by $79.9 million due to higher equivalent production volumes. the lower dd&amp;a rate was primarily due to lower cost reserve additions associated with our marcellus shale drilling program and the impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 associated with higher dd&amp;a rate fields. in addition, amortization of unproved properties increased $24.0 million as a result of ongoing evaluation of our unproved properties and the acquisition of undeveloped leaseholds in south texas in late 2014. accretion expense increased $1.8 million due to the acquisition of proved properties in south texas in late 2014 and an increase in asset retirement obligations as a result of revisions of previous estimates recorded in fourth quarter 2014.

•   impairment of oil and gas properties was $114.9 million in 2015 due to the impairment of certain non-core fields in south texas, east texas and louisiana. the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2015. in 2014, we recognized an impairment of oil and gas properties of $771.0 million related to certain non-core fields, primarily in east texas. the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2014 and management's decision not to pursue activity in these non-core areas in the then current price environments.
•   general and administrative decreased $13.1 million due to lower stock-based compensation expense of $7.8 million primarily due to a decline in the company's stock price during 2015 compared to 2014 and $1.8 million lower incentive compensation expense. the remaining increase and decreases in other expenses were not individually significant.
earnings (loss) on equity method investments the increase in equity method earnings (loss) is the result of our proportionate share of net earnings from our equity method investments in 2015 compared to 2014.
gain (loss) on sale of assets during 2015, we recognized a net aggregate gain of $3.9 million primarily due to the sale of certain unproved oil and gas properties in east texas. during 2014, we recognized a net aggregate gain of $17.1 million primarily due to the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas.
interest expense interest expense increased $23.1 million due to $24.1 million of higher interest expense associated with our private placement in september 2014 of $925 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes with a weighted-average interest rate of 3.65% and higher commitment fees on the unused portion of our revolving credit facility of $1.0 million. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $1.7 million associated with our revolving credit facility due to a decrease in weighted-average borrowings based on daily balances of approximately $347.2 million compared to approximately $410.0 million during 2015 and 2014, respectively.
income tax expense (benefit)
income tax benefit increased $1.3 million due to lower pretax income, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. the effective tax rates for 2015 and 2014 were 39.2% and (222.4)%, respectively. the overall effective tax rate for 2014 was significantly lower due to a change in our effective state income tax rates based on updated state apportionment factors in states in which we operate. the 2014 decrease in our state apportionment factors was primarily driven by a shift in the sourcing of revenues based on the location of customers to whom we ultimately sell our natural gas in the northeast united states. the 2014 decrease in effective state income tax rates significantly affected our estimated net state deferred tax liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet, resulting in an income tax benefit of approximately $87.0 million that was reflected in our provision for income taxes in 2014.
we expect our 2016 effective income tax rate to be approximately 37.0%; however, this rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including but not limited to changes in enacted federal and/or state tax rates that occur during the year, as well as changes in the composition and location of our asset base, our employees and our customers.
2014 and 2013 compared we reported net income for 2014 of $104.5 million, or $0.25 per share, compared to net income for 2013 of $279.8 million, or $0.67 per share. the decrease in net income was due to higher operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in operating revenues and lower income taxes.

natural gas revenues the increase in natural gas revenues of $185.4 million is due to higher production, partially offset by lower natural gas prices. the increase in our production was the result of our marcellus shale drilling program in pennsylvania, partially offset by lower production primarily in oklahoma and west texas as a result of certain non-core asset dispositions in the fourth quarter of 2013 and normal production declines in texas and west virginia.
crude oil and condensate revenues the increase in crude oil and condensate revenues of $22.5 million is due to higher production, partially offset by lower crude oil prices. the increase in production was a result of our oil-focused eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas, partially offset by lower production associated with certain non-core asset dispositions in oklahoma and west texas in the fourth quarter of 2013.
gain (loss) on derivative instruments effective april 1, 2014, we elected to discontinue hedge accounting on a prospective basis. subsequent to april 1, 2014, our derivative instruments were accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. changes in fair value are recognized currently in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations. gain (loss) on derivative instruments includes an $81.7 million gain related to the change in fair value of realized cash settlements of derivative instruments previously frozen in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and a $137.6 million unrealized mark-to-market gain on our commodity derivative instruments.

total costs and expenses from operations increased by $869.9 million from 2013 to 2014. the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows:
•   direct operations increased $4.7 million largely due to higher operating costs as a result of higher production, an increase in disposal and recycling costs related to our marcellus shale operations and an increase in costs associated with oil processing and related fuel charges related to our eagle ford shale operations. partially offsetting these increases were lower costs associated with certain non-core assets in oklahoma and west texas that were sold in the fourth quarter of 2013.
•   transportation and gathering increased $119.8 million due to higher throughput as a result of higher production, slightly higher transportation rates and the commencement of various transportation and gathering agreements in late 2013 and during 2014.
•   brokered natural gas increased $0.1 million from 2013 to 2014. see the preceding table titled "brokered natural gas" for further analysis.
•   taxes other than income increased $4.0 million due to $2.5 million higher drilling impact fees associated with our marcellus shale drilling activities, $2.5 million higher production taxes and $0.9 million higher franchise and other taxes. production taxes increased due to higher oil production in south texas, offset by taxes associated with certain non-core assets in oklahoma and west texas that were sold in the fourth quarter of 2013. these increases are partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in ad valorem taxes.
•   exploration increased $10.6 million as a result of higher exploratory dry hole costs of $7.5 million and higher geophysical and geological and other exploration expenses.
•   depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $18.3 million due to a $36.2 million decrease in amortization of unproved properties in 2014 due to lower amortization rates as a result of favorable results from our drilling program in pennsylvania. this decrease was partially offset by a net increase in depreciation and depletion of $14.6 million, consisting of a $167.6 million increase due to higher equivalent production volumes for 2014 compared to 2013, partially offset by a decrease of $153.0 million due to a lower dd&amp;a rate of $1.13 per mcfe for 2014 compared to $1.42 per mcfe for 2013. the lower dd&amp;a rate was primarily due to lower cost of reserve additions associated with our marcellus shale drilling program and the impact of the disposition of higher rate fields in oklahoma and west texas in the fourth quarter of 2013.
•   impairment of oil and gas properties was $771.0 million in 2014 due to the impairment of certain non-core fields, primarily in east texas. the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2014 and management's decision not to pursue activity in these non-core areas in the current price environment. there was no impairment in 2013.
•   general and administrative decreased $22.0 million due to lower stock-based compensation expense of $30.4 million associated with the mark-to-market of our liability-based performance awards and our supplemental employee incentive plan due to changes in our stock price during 2014 compared to 2013 and lower employee-related expenses. these decreases were partially offset by increases in professional fees.
earnings (loss) on equity method investments the increase in equity method earnings (loss) is the result of the increase in our proportionate share of net earnings from our equity method investments in 2014 compared to 2013.
gain (loss) on sale of assets during 2014, we recognized a net aggregate gain of $17.1 million primarily due to the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas. during 2013, we recognized a net aggregate gain of $21.4 million, which includes a $19.4 million gain from the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the oklahoma and texas panhandles and a $17.5 million loss from the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in oklahoma, texas and kansas. we also sold various other proved and unproved properties in 2013 for a gain of $19.5 million.
interest expense interest expense increased $7.7 million as a result of an increase in interest expense of $9.7 million associated with our private placement in september 2014 of $925 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes with a weighted-average interest rate of 3.65%, higher commitment fees of $2.3 million and increased amortization of debt issuance costs of $1.1

million. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $3.1 million due to the repayment of $75.0 million of our 7.33% weighted-average senior notes in july 2013 and $1.1 million associated with our revolving credit facility due to a decrease in weighted-average borrowings based on daily balances of approximately $410.0 million compared to approximately $454.4 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively.
income tax expense (benefit)
income tax expense decreased $277.8 million due to lower pretax income and a lower effective tax rate.  the effective tax rates for 2014 and 2013 were (222.4)% and 42.4%, respectively. the overall effective tax rate was lower due to a change in our effective state income tax rates based on updated state apportionment factors in states in which we operate. the decrease in our state apportionment factors was primarily driven by a shift in the sourcing of revenues based on the location of customers to whom we ultimately sell our natural gas in the northeast united states. the decrease in effective state income tax rates significantly affected our estimated net state deferred tax liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet, resulting in an income tax benefit of approximately $87.0 million that was reflected in our provision for income taxes in 2014.

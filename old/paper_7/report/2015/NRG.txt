executive summary nrg energy, inc., or nrg or the company, is an integrated competitive power company, which produces, sells and delivers energy and energy products and services in major competitive power markets in the u.s. while positioning itself as a leader in the way residential, industrial and commercial consumers think about and use energy products and services. nrg has one of the nation's largest and most diverse competitive generation portfolios balanced with the nation's largest competitive retail energy business. the company owns and operates approximately 50,000 mw of generation; engages in the trading of wholesale energy, capacity and related products; transacts in and trades fuel and transportation services; and directly sells energy, services, and innovative, sustainable products and services to retail customers under the names "nrg", "reliant" and other retail brand names owned by nrg.
business environment the industry dynamics and external influences affecting the company and its businesses, and the power generation and retail energy industry in general in 2015 and for the future medium term include:
capacity markets - capacity markets are a major source of revenue for the company.  centralized capacity markets exist in iso-ne, miso, nyiso and pjm. bilateral markets exist in caiso and miso.  these auctions are either an annual market held three years ahead of the delivery period as in the case of pjm and iso-ne, or six months to one month ahead as in the case of nyiso.  many variables affect the prices derived in these auctions.  these variables include the load forecast, the target reserve margin, rules surrounding demand response, capacity performance penalties, capacity imports and exports from the region, new generation entrants, slope of the demand curve, generation retirements, the cost of retrofitting old generation to meet new environmental rules, expected profitability of the plant itself in the energy market and various other auction rules.  in theory, a high capacity price should be an indication that the iso doesn't have sufficient generation capacity against its needed reserve margin and new construction should enter the market.  similarly, a low capacity price suggests the market is over-built and units should retire.  the company has seen many swings in the pricing for capacity markets and the rules in many of the markets are undergoing significant changes, as discussed in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.  in addition, pjm integrated a new capacity performance construct into the market in 2015, as described in item 1 - business, regulatory matters.
commodities markets - the price of natural gas plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in many of the regions where nrg operates power plants.  natural gas prices are driven by variables including demand from the industrial, residential, and electric sectors, productivity across natural gas supply basins, costs of natural gas production, changes in pipeline infrastructure, and the financial and hedging profile of natural gas consumers and producers.  in 2015, average natural gas prices at henry hub were 40% lower than 2014.

if long-term gas prices further decrease or remain depressed, the company is likely to encounter lower realized energy prices, leading to lower energy revenues as higher priced hedge contracts mature and are replaced by contracts with lower gas and power prices.  nrg's retail gross margins have historically improved as natural gas prices decline and are likely to partially offset the impact of declining gas prices on conventional wholesale power generation.  to further mitigate this impact, nrg may increase its percentage of coal and nuclear capacity sold forward using a variety of hedging instruments, as described under the heading "energy-related commodities" in item 15 - note 5, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, to the consolidated financial statements.  the company also mitigates declines in long-term gas prices through its increased investment in renewable power generation supported by ppas.
natural gas prices are a primary driver of coal demand.  the low priced commodity environment has stressed coal equities, leading coal suppliers to file for bankruptcy protection, launch debt exchanges, rationalize assets, and cut production.  if multiple parties withdraw from the market, liquidity could be challenged in the short term.  inventory overhang will be utilized to offset production losses. coal prices are typically affected by the price of natural gas.
electricity prices - the price of electricity is a key determinant of the profitability of the company. many variables such as the price of different fuels, weather, load growth and unit availability all coalesce to impact the final price for electricity and the company's profitability. in 2015, electricity prices in the company's core markets were lower than 2014 primarily due to lower natural gas prices.  in 2014, electricity prices in the company's core markets were generally higher than 2013 primarily due to higher natural gas prices. the following table summarizes average on-peak power prices for each of the major markets in which nrg operates for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013:

environmental regulatory landscape - the mats rule, finalized in 2012, is the primary regulatory force behind the decision to retrofit, repower or retire uncontrolled coal fired power plants. companies are nearly done with their plans to comply as many units received a one-year extension until april 2016. in june 2015, the u.s. supreme court held that the epa unreasonably refused to consider costs when it determined to regulate haps emitted by electric generating units. the u.s. supreme court did not vacate the mats rule but rather remanded it to the d.c. circuit for further proceedings. a number of regulations on ghgs, ambient air quality, coal combustion byproducts and water use with the potential for increased capital costs or operational impacts have been finalized and are under review by the courts. the design, timing and stringency of these regulations and the legal outcomes will affect the framework for the retrofit or retirement of existing fossil plants and deployment of new, cleaner technologies in the next decade. see item 1- business, environmental matters, for further discussion.
public policy support and government financial incentives for clean infrastructure development - policy mechanisms including production and investment tax credits, cash grants, loan guarantees, accelerated depreciation tax benefits, rps, and carbon trading plans have been implemented at the state and federal levels to support the development of renewable generation, demand-side and smart grid, and other clean infrastructure technologies. the availability and continuation of public policy support mechanisms will drive a significant part of the economics of the company's development program. in december 2015, the u.s. congress enacted an extension of the 30% solar itc so that projects which begin construction in 2016 through 2019 will continue to qualify for the 30% itc.  projects beginning construction in 2020 and 2021 will be eligible for the itc at the rates of 26% and 22% respectively.  the same legislation also extended the 10 year wind ptc for wind projects which begin construction in years 2016 through 2019.  wind projects which begin construction in the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 are eligible for ptc at 80%, 60% and 40% of the statutory rate per kilowatt hour respectively.
63
weather - weather conditions in the regions of the u.s. in which nrg does business influence the company's financial results. weather conditions can affect the supply and demand for electricity and fuels. weather may also impact the availability of the company's generating assets. changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot and forward markets, which may affect the company's results in any given period. typically, demand for and the price of electricity is higher in the summer and the winter seasons, when temperatures are more extreme. the demand for and price of natural gas is also generally higher in the winter. however, all regions of the u.s. typically do not experience extreme weather conditions at the same time, thus nrg is typically not exposed to the effects of extreme weather in all parts of its business at once.
wind and solar resource availability - wind and solar resource availability can affect the company's results. the company's results were impacted by lower than normal wind resource availability in 2015. while the company's wind facilities were available, adverse weather had a negative impact on wind resources. the company cannot predict wind and solar resource availability and their related impacts on future results.
capital market conditions - the company and its peer group, along with the broader energy sector, have recently experienced volatile conditions in the capital markets, including debt and equity markets, due to continued depressed commodity markets. these conditions, if they persist, may make it difficult for the company, including genon and nrg yield, inc., to satisfy debt obligations which mature over the next few years at a reasonable cost. further, nrg yield, inc.'s growth strategy depends on its ability to identify and acquire additional conventional and renewable facilities from the company and unaffiliated third parties.  a prolonged disruption in the equity capital market conditions could make it difficult for nrg yield, inc. to obtain the necessary financing to successfully acquire projects, which could impact a source of the company's liquidity.
other factors - a number of other factors significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products for nrg's business. these factors include:
•   seasonal, daily and hourly changes in demand;
•   extreme peak demands;
•   available supply resources;
•   transportation and transmission availability and reliability within and between regions;
•   location of nrg's generating facilities relative to the location of its load-serving opportunities;
•   procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions; and
•   changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations.
these factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees. these effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in:
•   weather conditions;
•   market liquidity;
•   capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems;
•   local transportation systems; and
•   the nature and extent of electricity deregulation.
environmental matters, regulatory matters and legal proceedings - details of environmental matters are presented in item 15 - note 24, environmental matters, to the consolidated financial statements and item 1- business, environmental matters, section. details of regulatory matters are presented in item 15 - note 23, regulatory matters, to the consolidated financial statements and item 1- business, regulatory matters, section. details of legal proceedings are presented in item 15 - note 22, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. some of this information relates to costs that may be material to the company's financial results.
impact of inflation on nrg's results - for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the impact of inflation and changing prices (due to changes in exchange rates) on nrg's revenues and net income was immaterial.

management's discussion of the results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2015, and 2014
(loss)/income before income tax expense - the pre-tax loss of $5,094 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to pre-tax income of $135 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily reflects:
•   an increase of $4,989 million in impairment losses;
•   a current year decrease from net mark-to-market results for economic hedges activity of $385 million;
•   an increase of $448 million in other operating costs comprised primarily of depreciation and amortization, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs and development costs;
partially offset by:
•   an increase in economic gross margin of $455 million comprised of an increase in nrg home retail economic gross margin of $219 million, an increase in nrg yield economic gross margin of $170 million, an increase in nrg renew economic gross margin of $58 million, an increase in nrg home solar economic gross margin of $6 million, and an increase in nrg business economic gross margin of $2 million;
•   a decrease of $138 million in other expenses primarily relating to the gain on debt extinguishment.
net (loss)/income - the decrease in net income of $6,568 million primarily reflects the drivers discussed above, including income tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2015, of $1,342 million, compared to income tax expense of $3 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, which reflects the valuation allowance recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015.

economic gross margin the company evaluates its operating performance using the measure of economic gross margin, which is not a gaap measure and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or deemed more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report. the company believes that economic gross margin is useful to investors as it is a key operational measure reviewed by the company's chief operating decision maker. economic gross margin is defined as the sum of energy revenue, capacity revenue, retail revenue and other revenue, less cost of sales.
economic gross margin excludes the following elements from gross margin: mark-to-market gains or losses on economic hedging activities, contract amortization and emission credit amortization.
the following tables present the composition of economic gross margin, business metrics and weather metrics for the years ended december 31, 2015, and 2014:

$1,220                      $1,027
selling and marketing expenses increased $166 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, due primarily to an increase in expense related to retail acquisitions as well as channel and product expansions in the core retail business, which also contributed to margin expansion during the same time period. the increase was also driven by home solar acquisitions in 2014, which provided nrg home solar with an installation team, a sales team and additional sales channels.
general and administrative expenses increased by $27 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, due primarily to expansion of the home solar business partially offset by continued integration and cost management efforts.
acquisition-related transaction and integration costs nrg incurred transaction and integration costs of $10 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to $84 million for the same period in 2014. the reduction in transaction and integration costs is due primarily to the substantial completion of integration activities for the acquisitions of alta wind, dominion and eme in 2014.
development costs nrg incurred development costs of $154 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to $91 million for the same period in 2014. the increase in development costs is due to increased development activities, primarily for renewables and nrg evgo.
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates nrg's equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was $36 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to $38 million for the same period in 2014, due primarily to lower income at watson, midway sunset, and saguaro, partially offset by nrg yield, inc.'s acquisition of desert sunlight.
impairment losses on investments in 2015, the company recorded other-than-temporary impairment losses on certain of its cost and equity-method investments of $56 million, as further described in item 15 - note 10, asset impairments, to the consolidated financial statements.
(loss)/gain on sale of equity method investment in the fourth quarter of 2015, the company sold its 32% interest in altenex, as described in item 15 - note 3, business acquisitions and dispositions, to the consolidated financial statements. in connection with the sale the company received cash proceeds of $26 million and recorded a loss on the sale of $14 million.
in the fourth quarter of 2014, the company sold its investment in sabine, as described in item 15 - note 3, business acquisitions and dispositions, to the consolidated financial statements. in connection with the sale, the company received cash proceeds of $35 million and recorded a gain on the sale of $18 million.
gain/(loss) on debt extinguishment a gain on debt extinguishment of $75 million was recorded for the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily driven by the repurchase of nrg senior notes due 2023 and 2024, genon senior notes due 2020, and genon americas generation senior notes due 2021 and 2031 at a price below par value, combined with the write-off of unamortized premium. the repurchase of senior notes during 2015 will result in future interest savings of approximately $42 million annually.
in the fourth quarter of 2014, a loss of $95 million was recorded primarily due to the redemption premiums from the redemption of the 2019 senior notes. these gains/losses also included the write-off of previously deferred financing costs.

management's discussion of the results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2014, and 2013
economic gross margin the company evaluates its operating performance using the measure of economic gross margin, which is not a gaap measure and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or deemed more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report. the company believes that economic gross margin is useful to investors as it is a key operational measure reviewed by the company's chief operating decision maker. economic gross margin is defined as the sum of energy revenue, capacity revenue, retail revenue and other revenue, less cost of sales.
economic gross margin excludes the following elements from gross margin: mark-to-market gains or losses on economic hedging activities, contract amortization and emission credit amortization.
the following tables present the composition of economic gross margin, business metrics and weather metrics for the years ended december 31, 2014, and 2013:

(a)   includes reserves primarily for debt service, performance obligations, and capital expenditures for the year ended december 31, 2015, total liquidity, excluding collateral funds deposited by counterparties, decreased by $635 million. changes in cash and cash equivalent balances are further discussed hereinafter under the heading cash flow discussion. cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2015, were predominantly held in money market funds invested in treasury securities, treasury repurchase agreements or government agency debt.
management believes that the company's liquidity position and cash flows from operations will be adequate to finance operating and maintenance capital expenditures, to fund dividends to nrg's common and preferred stockholders, and other liquidity commitments. management continues to regularly monitor the company's ability to finance the needs of its operating, financing and investing activity within the dictates of prudent balance sheet management.
restricted payments tests of the $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents of the company as of december 31, 2015, $299 million and $192 million were held by genon mid-atlantic and rema, respectively. the ability of certain of genon's and genon americas generation's subsidiaries to pay dividends and make distributions is restricted under the terms of certain agreements, including the genon mid-atlantic and rema operating leases.  under their respective operating leases, genon mid-atlantic and rema are not permitted to make any distributions and other restricted payments unless:  (a) they satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters; (b) they are projected to satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for each of the two following periods of four fiscal quarters, commencing with the fiscal quarter in which such payment is proposed to be made; and (c) no significant lease default or event of default has occurred and is continuing.  in addition, prior to making a dividend or other restricted payment, rema must be in compliance with the requirement to provide credit support to the owner lessors securing its obligation to pay scheduled rent under its leases. based on genon mid-atlantic's and rema's most recent calculations of these tests, genon mid-atlantic and rema did not satisfy the restricted payments tests. as a result, as of december 31, 2015, genon mid-atlantic and rema could not make distributions of cash and certain other restricted payments. each of genon mid-atlantic and rema may recalculate its fixed charge coverage ratios from time to time and, subject to compliance with the restricted payments test described above, make dividends or other restricted payments.
to the extent genon mid-atlantic or rema are able to pay dividends to genon, the genon senior notes due 2018 and 2020 and the related indentures restrict the ability of genon to incur additional liens and make certain restricted payments, including dividends. in the event of a default or if restricted payment tests are not satisfied, genon would not be able to distribute cash to its parent, nrg. at december 31, 2015, genon did not meet the consolidated debt ratio component of the restricted payments test.
87
as disclosed in item 15 - note 12, debt and capital leases, to the consolidated financial statements, certain of genon's senior unsecured notes mature in 2017 and 2018. if genon is not able to refinance these notes prior to their maturities, it may have an adverse impact on genon's financial position. genon will consider all options available to it, including refinancing the notes, potential sales of certain generating assets or issuances of new debt securities. given current economic and market conditions, including the depressed commodity markets, genon may be unable to complete these actions on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or at all. these actions also may not be sufficient to enable genon to continue to satisfy its related cash commitments as they become due.
genon's financial position continues to be adversely affected by a sustained decline in natural gas prices and its resulting effect on wholesale power prices.  in addition, genon mid-atlantic and rema are currently unable to make distributions of cash and certain other restricted payments to genon. if gas and power prices remain depressed, genon may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meets its long-term liquidity requirements, including operating, maintenance and capital expenditures and debt service payments.
credit ratings credit rating agencies rate a firm's public debt securities. these ratings are utilized by the debt markets in evaluating a firm's credit risk. ratings influence the price paid to issue new debt securities by indicating to the market the company's ability to pay principal, interest and preferred dividends. rating agencies evaluate a firm's industry, cash flow, leverage, liquidity, and hedge profile, among other factors, in their credit analysis of a firm's credit risk.

cash grants as of december 31, 2015, the company had a net renewable energy grant receivable of $13 million, net of sequestration. the receivable balance reflects a reduction as compared to the december 31, 2014, balance of $135 million, net of sequestration, due primarily to a cash grant of approximately $51 million awarded by the u.s. treasury department to the company for the ivanpah project in june 2015 as well as the establishment of an indemnity receivable in the amount of $75 million relating to the agreement the company has with sunpower relating to the cvsr project in the first quarter of 2015.
90
indemnity receivable the company has a receivable of $75 million pursuant to an indemnity agreement the company has with sunpower relating to the cvsr project.  pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement for the cvsr project between nrg and sunpower, sunpower agreed to indemnify nrg up to $75 million if the u.s. treasury department made certain determinations and awarded a reduced 1603 cash grant for the project.  sunpower has refused to honor its contractual indemnification obligation.  as a result, on march 19, 2014, nrg filed a lawsuit against sunpower in california state court, alleging breach of contract and also seeking a declaratory judgment that sunpower has breached its indemnification obligation.  nrg is seeking $75 million in damages from sunpower. on april 2, 2015, sunpower filed its answer to the lawsuit and also a cross-complaint alleging that nrg owes sunpower $7.5 million as a result of sunpower having paid more than its required share to cover the repayment of the doe cash grant bridge loans. in july 2015, nrg filed its answer to the cross-complaint. the court has set this case for trial on january 17, 2017.
first lien structure nrg has granted first liens to certain counterparties on a substantial portion of the company's assets, excluding assets acquired in the genon and eme (including midwest generation) acquisitions, assets held by nrg yield, inc. and nrg's assets that have project-level financing. nrg uses the first lien structure to reduce the amount of cash collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be required to post from time to time to support its obligations under out-of-the-money hedge agreements for forward sales of power or gas used as a proxy for power. to the extent that the underlying hedge positions for a counterparty are out-of-the-money to nrg, the counterparty would have claim under the first lien program. the first lien program limits the volume that can be hedged, not the value of underlying out-of-the-money positions. the first lien program does not require nrg to post collateral above any threshold amount of exposure. within the first lien structure, the company can hedge up to 80% of its coal and nuclear capacity, excluding genon coal capacity, and 10% of its other assets, excluding genon's other assets, with these counterparties for the first 60 months and then declining thereafter. net exposure to a counterparty on all trades must be positively correlated to the price of the relevant commodity for the first lien to be available to that counterparty. the first lien structure is not subject to unwind or termination upon a ratings downgrade of a counterparty and has no stated maturity date.
the company's first lien counterparties may have a claim on its assets to the extent market prices exceed the hedged prices. as of december 31, 2015, all hedges under the first liens were in-the-money on a counterparty aggregate basis.
the following table summarizes the amount of mw hedged against the company's coal and nuclear assets and as a percentage relative to the company's coal and nuclear capacity under the first lien structure as of december 31, 2015:

uses of liquidity the company's requirements for liquidity and capital resources, other than for operating its facilities, can generally be categorized by the following: (i) commercial operations activities; (ii) debt service obligations, as described more fully in item 15 - note 12, debt and capital leases, to the consolidated financial statements; (iii) capital expenditures, including repowering and renewable development, and environmental; and (iv) allocations in connection with the capital allocation program including acquisitions, debt repayments, return of capital and dividend payments to stockholders, as described in item 15 - note 15, capital structure, to the consolidated financial statements.
91
commercial operations the company's commercial operations activities require a significant amount of liquidity and capital resources. these liquidity requirements are primarily driven by: (i) margin and collateral posted with counterparties; (ii) margin and collateral required to participate in physical markets and commodity exchanges; (iii) timing of disbursements and receipts (i.e. buying fuel before receiving energy revenues); (iv) initial collateral for large structured transactions; and (v) collateral for project development. as of december 31, 2015, commercial operations had total cash collateral outstanding of $568 million, and $768 million outstanding in letters of credit to third parties primarily to support its commercial activities for both wholesale and retail transactions (includes a $37 million letter of credit relating to deposits at the puct that cover outstanding customer deposits and residential advance payments). as of december 31, 2015, total collateral held from counterparties was $106 million in cash, and $184 million of letters of credit.
future liquidity requirements may change based on the company's hedging activities and structures, fuel purchases, and future market conditions, including forward prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. in addition, liquidity requirements are dependent on the company's credit ratings and general perception of its creditworthiness.

•   common stock dividends. on february 29, 2016, the company announced a reduction in its common stock dividend to $0.12 per share on an annualized basis. the decision to reduce the common stock dividend is a proactive measure taken by the company in order to reallocate capital in accordance with the priorities set forth in this section.

nols, deferred tax assets and uncertain tax position implications, under asc 740
as of december 31, 2015, the company had domestic pre-tax book loss of $5,105 million and foreign pre-tax book income of $11 million. for the year ended december 31, 2015, the company generated an nol of $263 million which is available to offset taxable income in future periods. as of december 31, 2015, the company has cumulative domestic federal nol carryforwards of $4.0 billion which will begin expiring in 2026 and cumulative state nol carryforwards of $4.2 billion for financial statement purposes. in addition, nrg has cumulative foreign nol carryforwards of $202 million, which do not have an expiration date. as a result of the company's tax position, and based on current forecasts, the company anticipates income tax payments, primarily due to state and local jurisdictions, of up to $40 million in 2016.
in addition to these amounts, the company has $32 million of tax effected uncertain tax benefits for which the company has recorded a non-current tax liability of $35 million until such final resolution with the related taxing authority. the $35 million non-current tax liability for uncertain tax benefits is from positions taken on various state returns, including accrued interest.
the company is no longer subject to u.s. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2012. with few exceptions, state and local income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2009.
off-balance sheet arrangements obligations under certain guarantee contracts nrg and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. these arrangements include financial and performance guarantees, stand-by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. see also item 15 - note 26, guarantees, to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion.
retained or contingent interests nrg does not have any material retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity.
derivative instrument obligation the company's 2.822% preferred stock includes a feature which is considered an embedded derivative per asc 815. although it is considered an embedded derivative, it is exempt from derivative accounting as it is excluded from the scope pursuant to asc 815. as of december 31, 2015, based on the company's stock price, the embedded derivative was out-of-the-money and had no redemption value. see also item 15 - note 15, capital structure, to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion.
obligations arising out of a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity variable interest in equity investments - as of december 31, 2015, nrg has several investments with an ownership interest percentage of 50% or less in energy and energy-related entities that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. several of these investments are variable interest entities for which nrg is not the primary beneficiary.
nrg's pro-rata share of non-recourse debt held by unconsolidated affiliates was approximately $621 million as of december 31, 2015. this indebtedness may restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to issue dividends or distributions to nrg. see also item 15 - note 16, investments accounted for by the equity method and variable interest entities, to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion.

fair value of derivative instruments nrg may enter into power purchase and sales contracts, fuel purchase contracts and other energy-related financial instruments to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuations in spot market prices and to hedge fuel requirements at generation facilities or retail load obligations. in addition, in order to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the issuance of the company's variable rate and fixed rate debt, nrg enters into interest rate swap agreements.
nrg's trading activities are subject to limits in accordance with the company's risk management policy. these contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recognized in earnings.
the tables below disclose the activities that include both exchange and non-exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value in accordance with asc 820, fair value measurements and disclosures, or asc 820. specifically, these tables disaggregate realized and unrealized changes in fair value; disaggregate estimated fair values at december 31, 2015, based on their level within the fair value hierarchy defined in asc 820; and indicate the maturities of contracts at december 31, 2015. for a full discussion of the company's valuation methodology of its contracts, see derivative fair value measurements in item 15 - note 4, fair value of financial instruments, to the consolidated financial statements.

the company has elected to disclose derivative assets and liabilities on a trade-by-trade basis and does not offset amounts at the counterparty master agreement level. also, collateral received or paid on the company's derivative assets or liabilities are recorded on a separate line item on the balance sheet. consequently, the magnitude of the changes in individual current and non-current derivative assets or liabilities is higher than the underlying credit and market risk of the company's portfolio. as discussed in item 7a - quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, commodity price risk, nrg measures the sensitivity of the company's portfolio to potential changes in market prices using var, a statistical model which attempts to predict risk of loss based on market price and volatility. nrg's risk management policy places a limit on one-day holding period var, which limits the company's net open position. as the company's trade-by-trade derivative accounting results in a gross-up of the company's derivative assets and liabilities, the net derivative assets and liability position is a better indicator of nrg's hedging activity. as of december 31, 2015, nrg's net derivative asset was $6 million, a decrease to total fair value of $407 million as compared to december 31, 2014. this decrease was primarily driven by the roll-off of trades that settled during the period and losses in fair value.
based on a sensitivity analysis using simplified assumptions, the impact of a $0.50 per mmbtu increase in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would result in a decrease of approximately $414 million in the net value of derivatives as of december 31, 2015.
the impact of a $0.50 per mmbtu decrease in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would result in an increase of approximately $392 million in the net value of derivatives as of december 31, 2015.

critical accounting policies and estimates nrg's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with u.s. gaap requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. the application of these policies involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. these judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. in addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies have not changed.
on an ongoing basis, nrg evaluates these estimates, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods the company considers reasonable. in any event, actual results may differ substantially from the company's estimates. any effects on the company's business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known.
nrg's significant accounting policies are summarized in item 15 - note 2, summary of significant accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements. the company identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the company's financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.

derivative instruments the company follows the guidance of asc 815 to account for derivative instruments. asc 815 requires the company to mark-to-market all derivative instruments on the balance sheet and recognize changes in the fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments immediately in earnings. in certain cases, nrg may apply hedge accounting to the company's derivative instruments. the criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are: (i) the designation of the hedge to an underlying exposure; (ii) whether the overall risk is being reduced; and (iii) if there is a correlation between the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument and the underlying hedged item. changes in the fair value of derivatives instruments accounted for as hedges are either recognized in earnings as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the related hedged item, or deferred and recorded as a component of oci and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur.
for purposes of measuring the fair value of derivative instruments, nrg uses quoted exchange prices and broker quotes. when external prices are not available, nrg uses internal models to determine the fair value. these internal models include assumptions of the future prices of energy commodities based on the specific market in which the energy commodity is being purchased or sold, using externally available forward market pricing curves for all periods possible under the pricing model. in order to qualify derivative instruments for hedged transactions, nrg estimates the forecasted generation and forecasted borrowings for interest rate swaps occurring within a specified time period. judgments related to the probability of forecasted generation occurring are based on available baseload capacity, internal forecasts of sales and generation, and historical physical delivery on similar contracts. judgments related to the probability of forecasted borrowings are based on the estimated timing of project construction, which can vary based on various factors. the probability that hedged forecasted generation and forecasted borrowings will occur by the end of a specified time period could change the results of operations by requiring amounts currently classified in oci to be reclassified into earnings, creating increased variability in the company's earnings. these estimations are considered to be critical accounting estimates.
certain derivative instruments that meet the criteria for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope exception to derivative accounting, as they are considered to be npns. the availability of this exception is based upon the assumption that nrg has the ability and it is probable to deliver or take delivery of the underlying item. these assumptions are based on available baseload capacity, internal forecasts of sales and generation and historical physical delivery on contracts. derivatives that are considered to be npns are exempt from derivative accounting treatment and are accounted for under accrual accounting. if it is determined that a transaction designated as npns no longer meets the scope exception due to changes in estimates, the related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value combined with the immediate recognition through earnings.
income taxes and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2015, nrg had a valuation allowance of $3,575 million. this amount is comprised of domestic federal net deferred tax assets of approximately $2,973 million, domestic state net deferred tax assets of $542 million, foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $59 million, and foreign capital loss carryforwards of approximately $1 million. the company believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will not generate sufficient taxable income which includes the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences to realize deferred tax assets, requiring a valuation allowance to be recorded.
nrg continues to be under audit for multiple years by taxing authorities in other jurisdictions. considerable judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of a particular item that involves interpretations of complex tax laws. nrg is subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions including operations located in australia.
the company is no longer subject to u.s. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2012. with few exceptions, state and local income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2009.

evaluation of assets for impairment and other than temporary decline in value in accordance with asc 360, property, plant, and equipment, or asc 360, nrg evaluates property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. examples of such indicators or events are:
•   significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;
•   significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition;
•   adverse business climate;
•   accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset;
•   current-period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses; and
•   change in the company's intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than 50% likelihood that an asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life.
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through considering project specific assumptions for long-term power pool prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected plant operations. if such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets by factoring in the probability weighting of different courses of action available to the company. generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows. nrg uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel costs and operating costs. however, actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in the company's estimates, and the impact of such variations could be material.
for assets to be held and used, if the company determines that the undiscounted cash flows from the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset, nrg must estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment loss. assets held-for-sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell. the estimation of fair value under asc 360, whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset held-for-sale, and the evaluation of asset impairment are, by their nature, subjective. nrg considers quoted market prices in active markets to the extent they are available. in the absence of such information, the company may consider prices of similar assets, consult with brokers, or employ other valuation techniques. nrg will also discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate representative of the risk involved with such an investment or employ an expected present value method that probability-weights a range of possible outcomes. the use of these methods involves the same inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as previously discussed with respect to undiscounted cash flows. actual future market prices and project costs could vary from those used in the company's estimates, and the impact of such variations could be material. annually during the fourth quarter, the company revises its views of power and fuel prices including the company's fundamental view for long term prices in connection with the preparation of its annual budget. changes to the company's views of long term power and fuel prices impacted the company's projections of profitability, based on management's estimate of supply and demand within the sub-markets for each plant and the physical and economic characteristics of each plant.
the following long-lived asset impairments were recorded during 2015, as further described in item 15 -note 10, asset impairments, to the consolidated financial statements:
•in the fourth quarter of 2015, the company entered into an agreement to sell the seward facility. the company recorded an impairment loss of $134 million as of december 31, 2015 to reduce the carrying amount of the net assets held for sale to equal the agreed-upon sales price.
•during the third quarter of 2015, the company filed notice of its intent to retire huntley's operating units on march 1, 2016. on october 30, 2015, nyiso released the results of its reliability study, indicating that the huntley operating units are not needed for bulk system reliability. accordingly the company determined that the carrying amount of the assets was higher than the estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets and that the assets were impaired. the fair value of the huntley operating units was determined using the income approach. the income approach utilized estimates of discounted future cash flows, which include key inputs such as forecasted contract prices, forecasted operating expenses and discount rates. the company recorded an impairment loss of $132 million during the year ended december 31, 2015.
106
•during the third quarter of 2015, the company announced that dunkirk unit 2 will be mothballed on january 1, 2016, at the expiration of its reliability support services agreement. the project to add natural gas-burning capabilities has been suspended, pending the outcome of litigation with respect to the gas addition contract and its validity. on october 30, 2015, nyiso released the results of its reliability study, indicating that the dunkirk facility is not needed for system reliability. the company determined that the carrying amount of the assets was higher than the estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets and that the assets were impaired. the fair value of the dunkirk facility was determined using the income approach. the income approach utilized estimates of discounted future cash flows, which include key inputs such as forecasted contract prices, forecasted operating and capital expenditures and discount rates. the company recorded an impairment loss of $160 million during the year ended december 31, 2015.
•during the fourth quarter of 2015, the company recorded an impairment loss of $29 million to reduce the carrying value of certain solar panels to approximate fair value.
•during the fourth quarter of 2015, as the company revised its fundamental view for long term prices in connection with the preparation of its annual budget, it was noted that the cash flows for the limestone and w.a. parish coal fired facilities and the gregory combined cycle facility located in texas were lower than the carrying amount, primarily driven by declining power prices as the cost of commodities continues to decline. as a result of these updates and in connection with the preparation of the year-end financial statements, the company determined that the assets are impaired. the company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets and recognized impairment losses of $1,514 million, $1,295 million and $176 million related to limestone, w.a. parish, and gregory, respectively.
nrg is also required to evaluate its equity-method and cost-method investments to determine whether or not they are impaired in accordance with asc 323, investments - equity method and joint ventures, or asc 323. the standard for determining whether an impairment must be recorded under asc 323 is whether a decline in the value is considered an "other than temporary" decline in value. the evaluation and measurement of impairments under asc 323 involves the same uncertainties as described for long-lived assets that the company owns directly and accounts for in accordance with asc 360. similarly, the estimates that nrg makes with respect to its equity and cost-method investments are subjective, and the impact of variations in these estimates could be material. additionally, if the projects in which the company holds these investments recognize an impairment under the provisions of asc 360, nrg would record its proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate its investment for an other than temporary decline in value under asc 323. during the year ended december 31, 2015, the company recorded impairment losses on its equity-method and cost-method investments of $56 million due to "other than temporary" declines in value.
goodwill and other intangible assets at december 31, 2015, nrg reported goodwill of $999 million, consisting of $337 million associated with the acquisition of texas genco in 2006, or nrg texas, $341 million for its nrg home businesses, $278 million related to the acquisition of eme and $43 million associated with other business acquisitions. the company has also recorded intangible assets in connection with its business acquisitions, measured primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a level 3 measurement as defined in asc 820. see item 15 - note 3, business acquisitions and dispositions, and note 11, goodwill and other intangibles, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
the company applies asc 805, business combinations, or asc 805, and asc 350, to account for its goodwill and intangible assets. under these standards, the company amortizes all finite-lived intangible assets over their respective estimated weighted-average useful lives, while goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. however, goodwill and all intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairments at least annually, or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. the company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing whether the components of the company's operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components. the company performs the annual goodwill impairment assessment as of december 31 or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. nrg first evaluates qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that impairment has occurred. in the absence of sufficient qualitative factors, goodwill impairment is determined utilizing a two-step process. if it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, where necessary, the company's goodwill and/or intangible asset with indefinite lives will be impaired at that time.
107
the company performed step zero of the goodwill impairment test, performing its qualitative assessment of macroeconomic, industry and market events and circumstances, and the overall financial performance of the nrg b2b reporting unit (nrg curtailment solutions). the company determined it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the goodwill attributed to this reporting unit was less than its carrying amount and accordingly, no impairment existed for the year ended december 31, 2015.
the company performed step one of the two-step impairment test for the reporting units in the following table. the company determined the fair value of these reporting units using primarily an income approach. under the income approach, the company estimated the fair value of the reporting units' invested capital exceeds its carrying value and as such, the company concluded that goodwill associated with the reporting units in the following table is not impaired as of december 31, 2015:
reporting unit (segment)                                   % fair value over carrying value betm (corporate)                                                     138
midwest generation (nrg business)                                    114
nrg home retail - commodity (nrg home retail)                        896
nrg home retail - non-commodity (nrg home retail)                    119
solar power partners (nrg renew)                                     136
the company also performed step one of the two-step impairment test for its nrg texas, nrg home solar and goal zero reporting units. the company determined the fair value of these reporting units primarily using an income approach. in each case, the fair value of the reporting unit was determined to be less than its carrying amount and accordingly, the company performed step two of the two-step impairment test. the results of the impairment tests for these reporting units are detailed below and in item 15 - note 10, asset impairments, to the consolidated financial statements.
nrg texas the company believes the methodology and assumptions used in the valuation are consistent with the views of market participants. significant inputs to the determination of fair value were as follows:
•   the company applied a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budgets for all of the plants in the region. the significant assumptions used to derive the long-term budgets used in the income approach are affected by the following key inputs:
◦   the company's views of power and fuel prices considers market prices for the first five-year period and the company's fundamental view for the longer term, which reflect the company's long-term view of the price of natural gas. the company's fundamental view for the longer term reflects the implied power price and heat rate that would support new build of a combined cycle gas plant in the texas region. the price of natural gas plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in many of the regions where nrg operates power plants. hedging is included to the extent of contracts already in place;
◦   the company's estimate of generation, fuel costs, capital expenditure requirements and the existing and anticipated impact of environmental regulations;
◦   based on the company's fundamental view for the longer term, cash flows for the plants in the region were included in the fair value calculation through the end of each plants estimated useful life;
◦   projected generation and resulting energy gross margin in the long-term budgets is based on an hourly dispatch that simulates dispatch of each unit into the power market. the dispatch simulation is based on power prices, fuel prices, and the physical and economic characteristics of each plant.
•   the additional significant assumptions used in overall valuation of nrg texas are as follows:
◦   the discount rate applied to internally developed cash flow projections for the nrg texas reporting unit represents the weighted average cost of capital consistent with the risk inherent in future cash flows and based upon an assumed capital structure, cost of long-term debt and cost of equity consistent with comparable companies in the integrated utility industry.
108
◦   the intangible value to nrg texas for synergies it provides to nrg's retail businesses was determined by capitalizing estimated annual collateral cost savings of approximately $45 million per year and annual supply cost savings of approximately $18 million, tax affected at the appropriate tax rate and assuming this value decreases over the useful lives of the underlying plants. the estimates of annual collateral cost savings resulting from utilizing the company's wholesale generation assets to provide supply to retail represent the cost of collateral that would otherwise need to be held in reserve to support potential postings to third parties in the case of a significant price move. this is calculated from a combination of the volume the company would otherwise need to buy from these third parties, based on historical volumes, and historical price movements calibrated to an appropriate probability. the estimates of annual supply cost savings are based on historical volumes of retail purchases from nrg texas, an average bid-ask spread based on broker quotes and the assumption that nrg texas will realize half of the benefits associated with this savings.
under step one, if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. under the income approach described above, the company estimated the fair value of nrg texas' invested capital was 76% below its carrying value as of december 31, 2015 and concluded that step two was required. step two requires an allocation of fair value to the individual asset and liabilities using a hypothetical purchase price allocation in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded. under the step two analysis it was determined the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeded its fair value by approximately $1.4 billion and an impairment loss of this amount was recorded.
fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. as a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of the nrg texas reporting unit may include such items as follows:
•   falling or depressed long-term natural gas prices which may result in lower power prices in the markets in which the texas reporting unit operates;
•   a significant change to power plants' new-build/retirement economics and reserve margins resulting primarily from unexpected environmental or regulatory changes;
•   decrease in natural gas prices or significant changes to power plants' economics and expected generation could result in decreased realized synergies associated with estimated collateral and cost supply savings related to the combination of the nrg texas and texas retail businesses; and/or
•   macroeconomic factors that significantly differ from the company's assumptions in timing or degree.
the company noted that during 2015, the company observed a significant decrease in its stock price, which was driven in part by depressed commodity prices and resulted in a decline in industry-wide stock prices during 2015. the company's view on long-term commodity prices is reflected in the inputs utilized to test its goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment and reflects the current depressed commodity environment. if long-term natural gas prices remain depressed for an extended period of time, the company's remaining goodwill associated with nrg texas may be further impaired.
109
nrg home solar the company determined the fair value of the nrg home solar reporting unit using an income approach applying a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budgets for the reporting unit. the carrying amount of the reporting unit was higher than the fair value, and accordingly, the company recognized an impairment loss of $125 million during the fourth quarter of 2015 to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill that was recognized in connection with the acquisition.
the significant assumptions utilized in determining the fair value of the reporting unit included the company's estimates of lease growth, revenue and operating expenses, capital expenditures based on the company's view of the cost of solar installations, working capital requirements, general and administrative expenses and customer acquisition costs. cash flows were discounted using a discount rate applied to the internally developed cash flow projections for the nrg home solar reporting unit which represents the weighted average cost of capital consistent with the risk inherent in future cash flows and based upon an assumed capital structure, cost of long-term debt and cost of equity consistent with comparable companies in the residential solar industry.
goal zero during the third quarter of 2015, the company determined that there was an indication of goodwill impairment and performed a two-step goodwill impairment test. the carrying amount of the reporting unit was higher than the fair value, and accordingly, the company recognized an impairment loss of $36 million during the third quarter of 2015 to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill that was recognized in connection with the acquisition. the significant assumptions utilized in determining the fair value of the reporting unit included the company's estimates of customer acquisition and related revenue, which reflect a decrease in estimated customer growth as compared to estimates at the time of the acquisition, as well as estimated operating expenses. the discount rate applied to the internally developed cash flow projects represents the weighted average cost of capital consistent with the risk inherent in future cash flows and consistent with the purchase price of the acquisition.
contingencies nrg records a loss contingency when management determines it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. gain contingencies are not recorded until management determines it is certain that the future event will become or does become a reality. such determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts and circumstances, forecasts of future events, and estimates of the financial impacts of such events. nrg describes in detail its contingencies in item 15 - note 22, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements.

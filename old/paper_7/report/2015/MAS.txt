item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the financial and business analysis below provides information which we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes.
the following discussion and certain other sections of this report contain statements that reflect our views about our future performance and constitute "forward-looking statements" under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as "believe," "anticipate," "appear," "may," "will," "should," "intend," "plan," "estimate," "expect," "assume," "seek," "forecast" and similar references to future periods. our views about future performance involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in our forward-looking statements. we caution you against relying on any of these forward-looking statements.
in addition to the various factors included in the "executive level overview," "critical accounting policies and estimates" and "outlook for the company" sections, our future performance may be affected by the levels of home improvement activity and new home construction, our ability to maintain our strong brands and to develop and introduce new and improved products, our ability to maintain our competitive position in our industries, our reliance on key customers, our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of our strategic initiatives, our ability to sustain the performance of our cabinetry businesses, the cost and availability of raw materials, our dependence on third party suppliers, and risks associated with international operations and global strategies. these and other factors are discussed in detail in item 1a "risk factors" of this report. any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as of the date on which it was made. factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. unless required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
executive level overview we design, manufacture, market and distribute branded home improvement and building products. these products are sold for home improvement and new home construction through home center retailers, mass merchandisers, hardware stores, homebuilders, distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors and direct to the consumer.
2015 results net sales were positively affected by increased repair and remodel activity and new home construction in the u.s. and europe, favorable product mix, net selling price increases and acquisitions. such increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation, primarily due to the stronger u.s. dollar compared to the euro. our results of operations were positively affected by increased sales volume, operational efficiencies due to benefits resulting from cost savings initiatives and a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs.
our cabinets and related products segment was positively affected by operational efficiencies due to benefits resulting from business rationalization activities and other cost saving initiatives and decreased business rationalization expenses. our plumbing products segment benefited from increased sales volume and a favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and was negatively impacted by unfavorable product mix and an increase in certain variable expenses. the decorative architectural products segment benefited from increased sales volume of paints and stains and builders' hardware, a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs in
19
paints and stains and operational efficiencies due to benefits associated with cost savings initiatives. our other specialty products segment benefited from increased volume, a more favorable product mix of u.s. windows and a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs of windows in the u.s. and the u.k.
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"). the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. we regularly review our estimates and assumptions, which are based upon historical experience, as well as current economic conditions and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
note a to our consolidated financial statements includes our accounting policies, estimates and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition and receivables we recognize revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered. we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings, including special pricing and co-operative advertising arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives. we monitor our customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of our customers on an on-going basis and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments.
goodwill and other intangible assets we record the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets. in the fourth quarter of each year, or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, we complete the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method. we selected the discounted cash flow methodology because we believe that it is comparable to what would be used by other market participants. we have defined our reporting units and completed the impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level, as defined by gaap.
determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, including long-term projections of cash flows, market conditions and appropriate discount rates. our judgments are based upon historical experience, current market trends, consultations with external valuation specialists and other information. while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable, different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes. in estimating future cash flows, we rely on internally generated five-year forecasts for sales and operating profits, including capital expenditures, and, currently, a one to three percent long-term assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the five-year forecast. we generally develop these forecasts based upon, among other things, recent sales
20
data for existing products, planned timing of new product launches, estimated repair and remodel activity and estimated housing starts. our assumptions included a relatively stable u.s. gross domestic product ranging from 2.4 percent to 2.9 percent and a euro zone gross domestic product ranging from 1.5 percent to 1.8 percent over the five-year forecast.
we utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 8.5 percent as the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows. our weighted average cost of capital decreased in 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to less risk associated with our stock in relation to the capital markets. in 2015, based upon our assessment of the risks impacting each of our businesses, we applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of 10.5 percent to 12.5 percent for our reporting units.
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we measure the possible goodwill impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any previously unrecognized intangible assets (step two analysis). the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting unit's recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill.
in the fourth quarter of 2015, we estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for all of our reporting units were greater than the carrying values. accordingly, we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill.
a 10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units at december 31, 2015 would not have resulted in any additional analysis of goodwill impairment for any reporting unit.
we review our other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, in the fourth quarter, or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the business unit. we consider the implications of both external (e.g., market growth, competition and local economic conditions) and internal (e.g., product sales and expected product growth) factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near- and long-term. in 2015, we did not recognize any impairment charges for other indefinite-lived intangible assets.
employee retirement plans effective january 1, 2010, we froze all future benefit accruals under substantially all of our domestic qualified and non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans.
accounting for defined-benefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future, based upon vested years of service, and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works. we develop our pension costs and obligations from actuarial valuations. inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates and discount rates for obligations and expenses. we consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in selecting these assumptions. while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable, different estimates and assumptions could result in different reported pension costs and obligations within our consolidated financial statements.
in december 2015, our discount rate increased for obligations to an average of 4.0 percent from 3.8 percent. the discount rate for obligations is based upon the expected duration of each defined-benefit pension plan's liabilities matched to the december 31, 2015 towers watson rate link curve. the discount rates we use for our defined-benefit pension plans ranged from 2.0 percent to 4.3 percent, with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 4.0 percent or higher. the assumed asset return was primarily 7.25 percent, reflecting the expected long-term return on plan assets.
21
our net underfunded amount for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans, which is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets, decreased to $401 million at december 31, 2015 from $454 million at december 31, 2014. our projected benefit obligation for our unfunded non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans was $174 million at december 31, 2015 compared with $190 million at december 31, 2014.
the decrease in the projected benefit obligations was primarily due to lower bond rates and a change to the mp 2015 mortality improvement scale issued by the u.s. society of actuaries, which decreased our long-term pension liabilities. our qualified domestic pension plan assets in 2015 had a net loss of 1.8 percent.
at december 31, 2015, we reported a net liability of $575 million, of which $174 million was related to our non-qualified, supplemental retirement plans, which are not subject to the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006. in accordance with the pension protection act, the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the various defined-benefit pension plans ranges from 78 percent to 114 percent.
we expect pension expense for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans to be $24 million in 2016 compared with $22 million in 2015. if we assumed that the future return on plan assets was one-half percent lower than the assumed asset return and the discount rate decreased by 50 basis points, the 2016 pension expense would increase by $5 million. we expect pension expense for our non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans to be $9 million in 2016, compared to $10 million in 2015.
we anticipate that we will be required to contribute approximately $25 million in 2016 to our qualified and non-qualified defined-benefit plans. refer to footnote m for further information regarding the funding of our plans.
income taxes deferred taxes are recognized based on the future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. the future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods. possible sources of taxable income include taxable income in carryback periods, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability, tax-planning strategies that generate future income or gains in excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and projected future taxable income.
if, based upon all available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not (more than 50 percent likely) such deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded. significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable. a company's three-year cumulative loss position is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable, and the accounting guidance restricts the amount of reliance we can place on projected taxable income to support the recovery of the deferred tax assets.
in 2010, we recorded a $372 million valuation allowance against our u.s. federal deferred tax assets as a non-cash charge to income tax expense. in reaching this conclusion, we considered the weaker retail sales of certain of our building products and the slower than anticipated recovery in the u.s. housing market which led to u.s. operating losses and significant u.s. goodwill impairment charges, that primarily occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010, causing us to be in a three-year cumulative u.s. loss position.
during 2012 and 2011, objective and verifiable negative evidence, such as u.s. operating losses and significant impairment charges for u.s. goodwill and other intangible assets, continued to outweigh positive evidence necessary to reduce the valuation allowance. as a result, we recorded increases of $65 million and $87 million in the valuation allowance related to our u.s. federal deferred tax assets in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
22
in the third quarter of 2014, we recorded a $517 million tax benefit from the release of the valuation allowance against our u.s. federal and certain state deferred tax assets due primarily to a return to sustainable profitability in our u.s. operations. in reaching this conclusion, we considered the continued improvement in both the new home construction market and repair and remodel activity in the u.s. and our progress on strategic initiatives to reduce costs and expand our product leadership positions which contributed to the continued improvement in our u.s. operations over the past few years.
in the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded an additional $12 million tax benefit from the release of the valuation allowances against certain u.k. and mexican deferred tax assets primarily resulting from a return to sustainable profitability in these jurisdictions.
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on certain state and foreign deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2015. should we determine that we would not be able to realize our remaining deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made. the need to maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate.
the current accounting guidance allows the recognition of only those income tax positions that have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. we believe that there is an increased potential for volatility in our effective tax rate because this threshold allows changes in the income tax environment and the inherent complexities of income tax law in a substantial number of jurisdictions to affect the computation of our liability for uncertain tax positions to a greater extent.
while we believe we have adequately provided for our uncertain tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could vary from our liability for uncertain tax positions. accordingly, additional provisions for tax-related matters, including interest and penalties, could be recorded in income tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved.
warranty at the time of sale, we accrue a warranty liability for the estimated cost to provide products, parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations. our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based upon the information available and includes a number of factors such as the warranty coverage, the warranty period, historical experience specific to the nature, frequency and average cost to service the claim, along with industry and demographic trends.
certain factors and related assumptions in determining our warranty liability involve judgments and estimates and are sensitive to changes in the aforementioned factors. we believe that the warranty accrual is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates thereby requiring adjustments to previously established accruals.
a significant portion of our business is at the consumer retail level through home center retailers and other major retailers. a consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return. however, certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from us. our revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when recognizing revenue, and deductions are recorded at the time of sale.
litigation we are subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims in the ordinary course of our business. liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based upon our professional knowledge and experience and that of our legal counsel. when estimates of our exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for recognition under accounting guidance,
23
amounts are recorded as charges to earnings. the ultimate resolution of these exposures may differ due to subsequent developments.
corporate development strategy we expect to maintain a balanced growth strategy pursuing organic growth by maximizing the full potential of our existing core businesses and complementing our existing business with smaller, strategic acquisitions. we acquired two businesses in 2015, endless pools and evolution manufacturing. endless pools expanded our product offering and distribution channels into the aquatic fitness category. evolution manufacturing expanded our offering of fiberglass and composite windows in the united kingdom. we believe these acquisitions will accelerate the growth of, and complement, our current businesses, watkins manufacturing and our uk-based window company, respectively. longer-term, we may seek larger, strategic acquisitions as our company continues to grow.
in addition, during the financial recession of the last decade, we actively managed our portfolio of companies by divesting of those businesses that did not align with our long-term growth strategy, including, in 2015, the spin off of our installation and other services businesses into an independent, publicly-traded company named topbuild. we will continue to review all of our businesses to determine which businesses may not be core to our long-term growth strategy.
liquidity and capital resources historically, we have largely funded our growth through cash provided by our operations, long-term bank debt and the issuance of notes in the financial markets, and by the issuance of our common stock, including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions. maintaining high levels of liquidity and focusing on cash generation are among our financial strategies. we also intend to pay down between $300 million and $500 million of our debt over the next several quarters.
our total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 98 percent and 75 percent at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
on june 15, 2015, we repaid and retired all of our $500 million, 4.8% notes on the scheduled retirement date.
on march 24, 2015, we issued $500 million of 4.45% notes due april 1, 2025. these notes are senior indebtedness and are redeemable at our option.
on march 28, 2013, we entered into a credit agreement (the "credit agreement") with a bank group, with an aggregate commitment of $1.25 billion and a maturity date of march 28, 2018. on may 29, 2015 and august 28, 2015, we amended the credit agreement with the bank group (the "amended credit agreement"). the amended credit agreement reduces the aggregate commitment to $750 million and extends the maturity date to may 29, 2020. under the amended credit agreement, at our request and subject to certain conditions, we can increase the aggregate commitment up to an additional $375 million with the current bank group or new lenders. see note k to the consolidated financial statements.
the amended credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain (a) a maximum net leverage ratio, as adjusted for certain items, of 4.0 to 1.0, and (b) a minimum interest coverage ratio, as adjusted for certain items, equal to or greater than 2.5 to 1.0. we were in compliance with all covenants and had no borrowings under our amended credit agreement at december 31, 2015.
we had cash, cash investments and short-term bank deposits of approximately $1.7 billion at december 31, 2015. our cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest bearing money market demand accounts, time deposit accounts, money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations. while we attempt to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk, it is possible that future changes in the financial markets could affect the security or availability of these investments.
24
of the $1.7 billion of cash, cash investments and short-term bank deposits we held at both december 31, 2015 and 2014, $630 million and $672 million, respectively, is held in our foreign subsidiaries. if these funds were needed for our operations in the u.s., their repatriation into the u.s. would not result in significant additional u.s. income tax or foreign withholding tax, as we have recorded such taxes on substantially all undistributed foreign earnings, except for those that are legally restricted.
we utilize derivative and hedging instruments to manage our exposure to currency fluctuations, primarily related to the european euro, british pound and the u.s. dollar; commodity cost fluctuations, primarily zinc and copper; and interest rate fluctuations, primarily related to debt issuances. we review our hedging program, derivative positions and overall risk management on a regular basis.
in the third quarter of 2015, we increased our quarterly dividend to $.095 per common share from $.09 per common share.
our current ratio was 1.3 to 1 and 1.6 to 1 at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the decrease in the current ratio was due to the approximately $500 million increase in short-term notes payable at december 31, 2015 compared to december 31, 2014 due to scheduled debt maturities.
cash flows significant sources and (uses) of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows, in millions:

working capital (receivables plus inventories, less accounts payable) as a % of net sales          11.1   %      11.6   %
25
net cash provided by operations of $699 million consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash and certain other items, including depreciation and amortization expense of $133 million, a $212 million net increase in deferred taxes and other non-cash items, including stock-based compensation expense and amortization expense related to in-store displays.
net cash used for financing activities was $410 million, primarily due to the retirement of $500 million of 4.8% notes due june 2015, $456 million for the repurchase and retirement of company common stock (as part of our strategic initiative to drive shareholder value, and includes 741 thousand shares repurchased to offset the dilutive impact of long-term stock awards granted in 2015), $126 million for cash dividends paid and $36 million for dividends paid to noncontrolling interest. other financing activities include the issuance of $497 million of notes, $75 million tax benefit from stock-based compensation, and $200 million of cash received from topbuild as a result of its new debt financing agreement, offset by $63 million of cash distributed to topbuild.
in september 2014, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million shares for retirement of our common stock in open-market transactions or otherwise, replacing the previous board of directors authorization established in 2007. at december 31, 2015, we had remaining authorization from our board of directors to repurchase up to an additional 27.8 million shares of our common stock. consistent with past practice, we anticipate repurchasing shares in 2016 as part of our strategic initiative. as part of our capital management strategy, we expect to repurchase up to $500 million of our common stock in 2016. some of these shares will be purchased to offset any dilution from long-term stock awards granted as part of our compensation programs.
we believe that our present cash balance and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund our near-term working capital and other investment needs. we believe that our longer-term working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from bank borrowings and future financial market activities.
net cash used for investing activities was $189 million, and included $158 million for capital expenditures, $41 million for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and $43 million for in-store displays. investing activities also include net cash provided from the sale of short-term bank deposits of $26 million.
we continue to invest in our manufacturing and distribution operations to increase our productivity, improve customer service and support new product innovation. capital expenditures for 2015 were $158 million, compared with $128 million for 2014 and $126 million for 2013. for 2016, capital expenditures, excluding any potential 2016 acquisitions, are expected to be approximately $190 million. depreciation and amortization expense for 2015 totaled $133 million, compared with $167 million for 2014 and $186 million for 2013, including accelerated depreciation of $1 million and $13 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. for 2016, depreciation and amortization expense, excluding any potential 2016 acquisitions, is expected to be approximately $140 million. amortization expense totaled $11 million, $10 million and $11 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had, nor do we expect them to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, financial position or results of operations.
consolidated results of operations we report our financial results in accordance with gaap in the united states. however, we believe that certain non-gaap performance measures and ratios, used in managing the business, may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods. non-gaap performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results under gaap.

sales and operations net sales for 2015 were $7.1 billion, which increased two percent compared with 2014. excluding acquisitions and the unfavorable effect of currency translation, net sales increased five percent compared to 2014. the following table reconciles reported net sales to net sales excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency translation, in millions:

operating profit margins in 2015 and 2014 were positively affected by increased sales volume, a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives. operating profit in 2015 was negatively affected by foreign currency translation.
other income (expense), net other, net, for 2015 included net gains of $6 million from investments in private equity funds and $2 million from equity investments. other, net, for 2015 also included realized foreign currency losses of $14 million and other miscellaneous items.
other, net, for 2014 included net gains of $4 million from investments in private equity funds and realized foreign currency gains of $5 million and other miscellaneous items. income from financial investments, net, for 2014 included losses from equity investments, net, of $2 million.
other, net, for 2013 included income from equity investments, net, of $16 million and gains of $11 million from investments in private equity funds. other, net, for 2013 also included realized foreign currency losses of $21 million and other miscellaneous items.
in 2013, in conjunction with the transaction to sell our danish ready-to-assemble cabinet business (included in discontinued operations), we also disposed of a related danish holding company. this disposition triggered the settlement of loans, which resulted in the recognition of $18 million of currency translation expense, which is included in other income (expense), net, from continuing operations in the statement of operations.
interest expense was $225 million in 2015 and 2014, and $235 million in 2013.
income and earnings per common share from continuing operations (attributable to masco corporation)
income and diluted income per common share from continuing operations for 2015 were $357 million and $1.03 per common share, respectively. income and diluted income per common share from continuing operations for 2014 were $821 million and $2.28 per common share, respectively. income and diluted income per common share from continuing operations for 2013 were $259 million and $.72 per common share, respectively.
our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 43 percent tax expense, 71 percent tax benefit and 22 percent tax expense in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. compared to our normalized tax rate of 36 percent, the variance in 2015 is primarily due to a $21 million valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets of topbuild recorded as a non-cash charge to income tax expense. the topbuild deferred tax assets have been impaired by our decision to spin off topbuild into a separate company that on a stand-alone basis as of june 30, 2015, the spin off date, will unlikely be able to realize the value of such deferred tax assets as a result of its history of losses.
28
the 2015 effective tax rate also includes a $19 million charge to income tax expense to recognize the required taxes on substantially all undistributed foreign earnings, except for those that are legally restricted. this charge was the result of our determination that we may need to repatriate earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously considered permanently reinvested in order to provide greater flexibility in the execution of our capital management strategy.
the variance from our normalized tax rate in 2014 and 2013 is due primarily to changes in the u.s. federal valuation allowance and reversal of an accrual for uncertain tax positions.
outlook for the company during 2015, we made progress on our strategic priorities, which include leveraging opportunities across our businesses, driving the full potential of our core businesses and actively managing our portfolio.

business segment results discussion changes in operating profit margins in the following business segment and geographic area results discussion exclude general corporate expense, net, and income from litigation settlements.
business rationalizations and other initiatives over the last several years, we have taken several actions focused on the strategic rationalization of our businesses including business consolidations, plant closures, headcount reductions and other cost savings initiatives. for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we incurred net pre-tax costs and charges related to these initiatives of $18 million, $64 million, and $47 million, respectively.
we continue to realize the benefits of our business rationalizations and continuous improvement initiatives across our enterprise and expect to identify additional opportunities to improve our business operations. we do not anticipate that any costs and charges related to our ongoing commitment to continuous improvement will be as significant as they have been in previous years.
during 2015, our plumbing segment incurred costs of $9 million primarily related to severance and other cost savings initiatives across multiple businesses. our cabinet business continued to incur costs and charges of $5 million primarily related to cost savings initiatives in north america. our corporate office incurred $4 million in costs primarily related to severance actions.
during 2014, our north american cabinet business incurred costs and charges of $31 million primarily related to actions taken to sell two previously idled manufacturing facilities. our corporate office incurred $27 million in costs primarily related to severance actions. finally, we incurred $6 million of costs and charges across our business units related to other cost savings initiatives.
30
during 2013, our north american cabinet business incurred costs and charges of $11 million related to the closure of a cabinet components facility and additional severance. our plumbing products segment incurred costs of $16 million related to a plant consolidation and severance in our bathing systems business in north america. finally, we incurred $20 million of costs and charges across our business units related to other cost savings initiatives.
based on current plans, we anticipate costs and charges related to our business rationalizations and other initiatives to approximate $8 million in 2016. we continue to evaluate our businesses and may implement additional rationalization programs based on changes in our markets which could result in further costs and charges.
cabinets and related products sales net sales of cabinets and related products increased three percent in 2015 compared to 2014. net sales increased primarily due to a favorable sales mix and selling price of north american and international cabinets, which increased sales by six percent compared to 2014. net sales decreased due to decreased sales volumes in both north america and international cabinets, which on a combined basis decreased sales by three percent compared to 2014.
net sales in this segment in 2014 decreased primarily due to lower sales volume and a less favorable product mix of north american operations, which decreased sales by nine percent compared to 2013. such decreases more than offset increased selling prices in north america and increased sales volume and a more favorable product mix of international cabinets, which increased sales by seven percent compared to 2013.
net sales in this segment in 2013 increased primarily due to increased sales volume of north american and international operations and by increased selling prices in north america. such increases were partially offset by a less favorable product mix in north america.

operating margins in this segment in 2014 were negatively affected by lower north american sales volume and the related under-absorption of fixed costs as well as increased business rationalization expenses. operating margins were also negatively affected by a less favorable product mix. such declines more than offset a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and the benefits associated with business rationalization activities and other cost savings initiatives.
operating margins in this segment in 2013 were positively affected by lower business rationalization expenses and the benefits associated with such expenses incurred in prior years. operating margins were also positively affected by a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs, as well as increased sales volume and the related absorption of fixed costs. such increases were partially offset by a less favorable product mix.

in november 2015, the fasb issued accounting standards update 2015-17 ("asu 2015-17"), "balance sheet classification of deferred taxes," which changes the criteria for classifying deferred tax balances by requiring all deferred taxes be presented as noncurrent on the balance sheet. we retrospectively adopted this guidance on december 31, 2015. as a result of the retrospective adoption of this standard, current assets decreased by $244 million, non-current assets increased by $219 million and non-current liabilities decreased by $25 million as of december 31, 2014.
in may 2014, fasb issued a new standard for revenue recognition, accounting standards codification 606 ("asc 606"). the purpose of asc 606 is to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability across industries. asc 606 is effective for us for annual periods beginning january 1, 2018. we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on our results of operations.
in february 2015, the fasb issued accounting standards update 2015-02 ("asu 2015-02") "consolidation (topic 810)  amendments to the consolidations analysis," which modifies certain aspects of both the variable interest entities and voting interest entities models. asu 2015-02 is effective for us for annual periods beginning january 1, 2016. we do not expect that the adoption will have a significant impact on our financial position or our results of operations.
in april 2015, the fasb issued accounting standards update 2015-03 ("asu 2015-03") "interest  imputation of interest (subtopic 835-30)  simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs," that requires that all costs incurred to issue debt be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt. in august 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-15 to clarify that debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements may remain classified as an asset. both asu 2015-03 and asu 2015-15 are effective for us for annual periods beginning january 1, 2016. we do not expect that the adoptions will have a significant impact on our financial position.

(a)
we assumed that all debt would be held to maturity.
(b)
there is no schedule for the capital commitments to the private equity funds; such allocation was estimated.
(c)
excludes contracts that do not require volume commitments and open or pending purchase orders.
(d)
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with uncertain tax positions, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate for the period beyond the next year in which cash settlements may occur with applicable tax authorities.

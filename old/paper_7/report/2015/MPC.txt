corporate overview we are an independent petroleum refining and marketing, retail and midstream company. we currently own and operate seven refineries, all located in the united states, with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.8 mmbpcd. our refineries supply refined products to resellers and consumers within our market areas, including the midwest, northeast, east coast, southeast and gulf coast regions of the united states. we distribute refined products to our customers through one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges, one of the largest terminal operations in the united states, and a combination of mpc-owned and third-party-owned trucking and rail assets. we are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers within our market area.
we have two strong retail brands: speedway® and marathon®. we believe that speedway llc, a wholly-owned subsidiary, operates the second largest chain of company-owned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the united states, with approximately 2,770 convenience stores in 22 states throughout the midwest, east coast and southeast. the marathon brand is an established motor fuel brand in the midwest and southeast regions of the united states, and is available through approximately 5,600 retail outlets operated by independent entrepreneurs in 19 states.
through our ownership interests in mplx and its wholly-owned subsidiary, markwest, we believe we are one of the largest processors of natural gas in the united states and the largest processor and fractionator in the marcellus and utica shale regions. our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas and ngls from some of the largest supply basins in the united states to domestic and international markets. our midstream gathering and processing operations include: natural gas gathering, processing and transportation; and ngl gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing. our assets include approximately 5,400 mmcf/d of gathering capacity, 7,100 mmcf/d of natural gas processing capacity and 500 mbpd of fractionation capacity as of december 31, 2015. we also own 5,000 miles of gas gathering and ngl pipelines and have ownership interests in over 50 gas processing plants, over 10 ngl fractionation facilities and one condensate stabilization facility. as of december 31, 2015, we owned, leased or had ownership interests in approximately 8,400 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas. overall, we are one of the largest independent petroleum product refining, marketing, retail and transportation businesses in the united states and the largest east of the mississippi.
our operations consist of three reportable operating segments: refining & marketing; speedway; and midstream. each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services they offer. see item 1. business for additional information on our segments.
•   refining &amp; marketing - refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our seven refineries in the gulf coast and midwest regions of the united states, purchases refined products and ethanol for resale and distributes refined products through various means, including barges, terminals and trucks that we own or operate. we sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, buyers on the spot market, our speedway business segment and to independent entrepreneurs who operate marathon® retail outlets.
•   speedway - sells transportation fuels and convenience products in the retail market in the midwest, east coast and southeast.
•   midstream - includes the operations of mplx and certain other related operations. following the markwest merger, we changed the name of this segment from pipeline transportation to midstream to reflect its expanded business activities. there were no changes to the historical financial information reported for this segment. the midstream segment gathers, processes and transports natural gas; gathers, transports, fractionates, stores and markets natural gas liquids and transports and stores crude oil and refined products.

net income attributable to mpc per diluted share                      $5.26               $4.39
net income attributable to mpc increased $328 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to our refining & marketing segment.
refining & marketing segment income from operations increased in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to higher crack spreads, favorable effects of changes in market structure on crude oil acquisition prices, more favorable net product price realizations compared to spot market reference prices and lower direct operating costs. these positive impacts were partially offset by unfavorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to benchmark lls crude oil, the unfavorable effect of lower commodity prices on volumetric gains and a lower of cost or market ("lcm") inventory valuation charge of $345 million.
speedway segment income from operations increased in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the full year benefit in 2015 from the financial results of the locations acquired along the east coast and southeast on september 30, 2014, as well as higher light product margin.
midstream segment income from operations increased in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the financial results of markwest, which are reflected in midstream segment income from the december 4, 2015 merger date, partially offset by $30 million of merger transaction costs.
mplx lp mplx is a publicly traded master limited partnership that was formed by us to own, operate, develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets related to the transportation and storage of crude oil, refined products and other hydrocarbon-based products. on december 4, 2015, mplx merged with markwest, whereby markwest became a wholly-owned subsidiary of mplx.
prior to the markwest merger, we owned a 71.5 percent interest in mplx, which included our two percent general partner interest. each common unit of markwest issued and outstanding at the time of the markwest merger was converted into the right to receive 1.09 common units of mplx and as of december 31, 2015, our ownership interest in mplx was 20.4 percent, including our two percent general partner interest. due to our general partner interest, we have determined that we control mplx and therefore we consolidate mplx and record a noncontrolling interest for the 79.6 percent interest owned by the public.
upon completion of the markwest merger, mplx assumed an aggregate principal amount of $4.1 billion in senior notes issued by markwest and markwest energy finance corporation. on december 22, 2015, mplx completed offers to exchange any and all outstanding markwest senior notes for (1) up to $4.1 billion aggregate principal amount of new notes issued by mplx having the same maturity and interest rates as the markwest senior notes and (2) cash of $1 for each $1,000 of principal amount exchanged. as of december 31, 2015, the exchange was completed on all the markwest senior notes except for 1.6 percent, or $63 million. in addition, markwest's existing credit facility was terminated and the approximately $943 million outstanding under markwest's bank revolving credit facility was repaid with $850 million of borrowings under mplx's bank revolving credit facility and $93 million in cash.
mplx's initial assets consisted of a 51 percent general partner interest in pipe line holdings, which owns a network of common carrier crude oil and product pipeline systems and associated storage assets in the midwest and gulf coast regions of the united states, and a 100 percent interest in a butane storage cavern in west virginia. we originally retained a 49 percent limited partner interest in pipe line holdings.
51
on may 1, 2013, we sold a five percent interest in pipe line holdings to mplx for $100 million, which was financed by mplx with cash on hand.
on march 1, 2014, we sold a 13 percent interest in pipe line holdings to mplx for $310 million. mplx financed this transaction with $40 million of cash on-hand and $270 million of borrowings on its bank revolving credit facility.
on december 1, 2014, we sold and contributed interests in pipe line holdings totaling 30.5 percent to mplx for $600 million in cash and 2.9 million mplx common units valued at $200 million. mplx financed the sales portion of this transaction with $600 million of borrowings on its bank revolving credit facility.
the sales and contribution of our interests in pipe line holdings to mplx resulted in a change of our ownership in pipe line holdings, but not a change in control. we accounted for these sales as transactions between entities under common control and did not record a gain or loss.
on december 8, 2014, mplx completed a public offering of 3.5 million common units at a price to the public of $66.68 per common unit, with net proceeds of $221 million. mplx used the net proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings under its bank revolving credit facility and for general partnership purposes. on december 10, 2014, we exercised our right to maintain our two percent general partner interest in mplx by purchasing 130 thousand general partner units for $9 million.
on february 12, 2015, mplx completed an underwritten public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of four percent unsecured senior notes due february 15, 2025. the senior notes were offered at a price to the public of 99.64 percent of par. the net proceeds of this offering were used by mplx to repay the amounts outstanding under its bank revolving credit facility, as well as for general partnership purposes.
on december 4, 2015, we sold our remaining 0.5 percent interest in pipe line holdings to mplx for $12 million. as a result, mplx now owns 100 percent of pipe line holdings.
distributions from mplx upon payment of the second-quarter distribution, the financial tests required for conversion of all of the mplx subordinated units, which were owned by a subsidiary of mpc, were met. accordingly, the subordinated units converted into common units on a one-for-one basis effective august 17, 2015, the first business day following the payment of the second quarter distribution.
the following table summarizes the cash distributions we received from mplx during 2015 and 2014.
(in millions)            2015                                            2014
cash distributions received from mplx:
general partner distributions, including idrs         $21              $4
limited partner distributions                          97              72

the market value of the 56.9 million mplx common units we owned at february 12, 2016 was $1.04 billion based on the february 12, 2016 closing unit price of $18.30. over time, we also believe there will be substantial value attributable to our two percent general partnership interest.
on january 25, 2016, mplx declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.50 per common unit, which was payable february 12, 2016. mpc's portion of this distribution was approximately $70 million.

acquisitions and investments on december 4, 2015, mplx merged with markwest, whereby markwest became a wholly-owned subsidiary of mplx. each common unit of markwest issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the markwest merger was converted into a right to receive 1.09 common units of mplx representing limited partner interests in mplx, plus a one-time cash payment of $6.20 per unit. each class b unit of markwest outstanding immediately prior to the merger was converted into the right to receive one class b unit of mplx having substantially similar rights, including conversion and registration rights, and obligations that the class b units of markwest had immediately prior to the merger. at closing, we contributed $1.23 billion in cash to mplx to pay the cash consideration to markwest common unitholders. we will contribute an additional total of $50 million in cash to mplx for the cash consideration to be paid upon the conversion of the mplx class b units to mplx common units in equal installments in july 2016 and july 2017, respectively. these contributions are with respect to mpc's existing interests in mplx (including idrs) and not in consideration of new units or other equity interest in mplx. we assigned the total consideration transferred of $8.6 billion, including the $7.3 billion fair value of the equity consideration and the $1.3 billion of cash contributions, to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities and noncontrolling interest assumed in the markwest merger, with the excess recorded as goodwill. as a result, we recognized total assets acquired of $11.6 billion, including $8.4 billion of property, plant and equipment and $2.5 billion of equity investments, and total liabilities and noncontrolling interests assumed of $5.5 billion, including $4.6 billion of assumed debt. the excess of the total consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired of $2.5 billion was recorded as goodwill in our midstream segment. goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if warranted due to events or changes in circumstances. see the critical accounting estimates - impairment assessments of long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill and equity investments section for a discussion of recent circumstances which may impact the assessment of this goodwill. our financial results and operating statistics reflect the results of markwest from the date of the acquisition.
consistent with our strategy to grow our midstream business, the markwest merger combines one of the nation's largest processors of natural gas and the largest processor and fractionator in the marcellus and utica shale regions with a rapidly growing crude oil and refined products logistics partnership sponsored by mpc. the complementary aspects of the highly diverse asset base of markwest, mplx and mpc provide significant additional opportunities across multiple segments of the hydrocarbon value chain. the combined entity will further markwest's leading midstream presence in the marcellus and utica shales by allowing it to pursue additional midstream projects, which should allow producer customers to achieve superior value for their growing production in these important shale regions. in addition, the combination provides significant vertical integration opportunities, as mpc is a large consumer of ngls.
in september 2015, we acquired a 50 percent ownership interest in a new joint venture with crowley maritime corporation through our investment in crowley ocean partners, which is included in our refining & marketing segment. the joint venture will operate and charter four new jones act product tankers, most of which will be leased to mpc. contributions to the joint venture with respect to each vessel will occur at the vessel's delivery. during 2015, we contributed $72 million in connection with delivery of the first two vessels. the remaining two vessels are expected to be delivered by the third quarter of 2016. we account for our ownership interest in crowley ocean partners as an equity method investment. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 25 for information on our conditional guarantee of the indebtedness of the joint venture and future contributions to crowley ocean partners.
on september 30, 2014, we acquired from hess all of its retail locations, transport operations and shipper history on various pipelines, including approximately 40 mbpd on colonial pipeline, for $2.82 billion. we refer to these assets as "hess' retail operations and related assets" and substantially all of these assets are part of our speedway segment. this acquisition significantly expands our speedway presence from nine to 22 states throughout the east coast and southeast and is aligned with our strategy to grow higher-valued, stable cash flow businesses. this acquisition also enables us to further leverage our integrated refining and transportation operations, providing an outlet for assured sales from our refining system. the transaction was funded with a combination of debt and available cash. our financial results and operating statistics reflect the results for hess' retail operations and related assets from the date of the acquisition.
53
in july 2014, we exercised our option to acquire a 35 percent ownership interest in enbridge inc.'s sax pipeline which runs from flanagan, illinois to patoka, illinois. this option resulted from our agreement to be the anchor shipper on the sax pipeline and our commitment to the sandpiper pipeline project as discussed below. during 2015, we made contributions of $147 million to illinois extension pipeline to fund our portion of the construction costs for the sax project. we have contributed $267 million since project inception. the pipeline became operational in december 2015. our investment in the pipeline is included in our midstream segment.
on april 1, 2014, we purchased a facility in cincinnati, ohio from felda iffco sdn bhd, malaysia for $40 million. the plant currently produces biodiesel, glycerin and other by-products. the capacity of the plant is approximately 60 million gallons per year.
in march 2014, we acquired from chevron raven ridge pipe line company an additional seven percent interest in explorer for $77 million, bringing our ownership interest to 25 percent. due to this increase in our ownership percentage, we now account for our investment in explorer using the equity method of accounting and report explorer as a related party. explorer owns approximately 1,900 miles of refined products pipeline from lake charles, louisiana to hammond, indiana.
in november 2013, we agreed with enbridge energy partners to serve as an anchor shipper for the sandpiper pipeline, which will run from beaver lodge, north dakota to superior, wisconsin. we also agreed to fund 37.5 percent of the construction of the sandpiper pipeline project, which is currently estimated to cost $2.6 billion, of which approximately $1.0 billion is our share. we made contributions of $71 million during 2015 and have contributed $287 million since project inception. in exchange for our commitment to be an anchor shipper and our investment in the project, we will earn an approximate 27 percent equity interest in enbridge energy partners' north dakota system when the sandpiper pipeline is placed into service. the anticipated in-service date for the pipeline is likely to be delayed to early 2019. the project schedule and cost estimates remain under review. enbridge energy partners' north dakota system currently includes approximately 240 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines connected to a transportation pipeline that is approximately 730 miles long. we will also have the option to increase our ownership interest to approximately 30 percent through additional investments in future system improvements.
see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 5 for additional information on these acquisitions and investments. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 25 for information regarding our future contributions to the sax pipeline project and the sandpiper pipeline project.
share repurchases since january 1, 2012, our board of directors has approved $10.0 billion in total share repurchase authorizations and we have repurchased a total of $7.24 billion of our common stock, leaving $2.76 billion available for repurchases as of december 31, 2015. under these authorizations, we have acquired 198 million shares at an average cost per share of $36.65.
liquidity as of december 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.13 billion and no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under our $2.5 billion bank revolving credit facility or $1.0 billion trade receivables securitization facility. as of december 31, 2015, eligible trade receivables supported borrowings of $668 million under the trade receivable securitization facility. mplx had $877 million of borrowings outstanding under its $2 billion revolving credit agreement as of december 31, 2015.
the above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to the estimated construction costs, timing and completion of the sandpiper project and the share repurchase authorizations. factors that could affect the estimated construction costs, timing and completion of the sandpiper pipeline project, include, but are not limited to, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. factors that could affect the share repurchase authorizations and the timing of any repurchases include, but are not limited to, business conditions, availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock. these factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
overview of segments refining & marketing refining & marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our refining & marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs.
our refining & marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale. the crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil,
54
commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. as a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate midwest (chicago) and usgc crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. lls prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of lls crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline, 2 barrels of ultra-low sulfur diesel and 1 barrel of three percent residual fuel oil) are used for these crack-spread calculations.
refined product prices have historically moved relative to international crude oil prices like brent crude. in recent years, domestic u.s. crude oils, such as wti and lls, have traded at prices less than brent due to the growth in u.s. crude oil production, logistical constraints and other market factors. these price discounts had favorably impacted the lls 6-3-2-1 crack spread. the decline in crude oil prices in 2015 has led to declines in sequential (month on month) onshore u.s. crude oil production and narrowed the lls discount to brent. with less near term production growth and the end of the ban on u.s. crude oil exports, lls and brent are expected to trade near parity.
our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. the amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our refining & marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude oil. in general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our refining & marketing gross margin.
future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors, as well as u.s. energy policy.
the following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions.
(in millions, after-tax)
lls 6-3-2-1 crack spread sensitivity(a) (per $1.00/barrel change)                    $450
sweet/sour differential sensitivity(b) (per $1.00/barrel change)                      220
lls-wti differential sensitivity(c) (per $1.00/barrel change)                          90
natural gas price sensitivity (per $1.00/million british thermal unit change)         140
(a)   weighted 40 percent chicago and 60 percent usgc lls 6-3-2-1 crack spreads and assumes all other differentials and pricing relationships remain unchanged.
(b)   lls (prompt) - [delivered cost of sour crude oil: arab light, kuwait, maya, western canadian select and mars].
(c)   assumes 20 percent of crude oil throughput volumes are wti-based domestic crude oil.
in addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sweet/sour differential and the discount of wti to lls, our refining & marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as:
•   the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed;
•   our refinery yields;
•   the selling prices realized for refined products;
•   the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk;
•   the cost of products purchased for resale; and
•   the potential impact of lcm adjustments to inventories in periods of declining prices.
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. costs of crude oil, refinery feedstocks and refined products are aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the lifo cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values. at december 31, 2015, market values for these inventories, which totaled approximately 4.0 billion gallons, were lower than their lifo cost basis and, as a result, we recorded an inventory valuation charge of $345 million to cost of revenues to value these inventories at the lower of cost or market. based on movements of refined product prices, future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative or positive effect to earnings. such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover. in 2016, inventory market values have continued to decline and if they do not recover to december 31, 2015 levels by march 31, 2016, an additional inventory valuation charge would be required in first quarter 2016.
in the fourth quarter 2015, we recorded a lifo charge of $45 million as a result of decreased levels in refined products and crude inventory volumes. since the lifo costs for these layers were based on 2014 costs, the liquidation of these layers resulted in a charge to income. in the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized builds in our refined product and crude inventories. these builds were based on 2014 costs which were significantly higher than fourth quarter 2014 costs and resulted in a benefit of approximately $240 million to income. for the full year, we recognized a lifo charge of $78 million in 2015 as compared to a lifo benefit of $265 million in 2014.
55
refining & marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refinery direct operating costs, which include turnaround and major maintenance, depreciation and amortization and other manufacturing expenses. changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. the following table lists the refineries that had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities for each of the last three years.

speedway our retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillate, which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, impacts the speedway segment profitability. numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand throughout the year, including local competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions. gasoline demand in padd 2 is estimated to have grown for the third consecutive year, increasing by 2.3 percent in 2015 and approaching 2007 levels after climbing by 0.5 percent in 2014. meanwhile, gasoline demand in padd 1 is estimated to have grown by 3.0 percent in 2015 after a 2.4 percent increase in 2014, returning to 2010 levels. continuing economic growth and year-on-year declines in prices supported gasoline demand. distillate demand in 2015 was softer than the very strong levels in 2014 which were supported by severe winter temperatures and a very strong harvest season. padd 2 distillate demand is estimated to have declined by 2.8 percent in 2015 after climbing by 4.3 percent to a record level in 2014. despite this decline, padd 2 demand is estimated to have remained near pre-recession highs. padd 1 estimated distillate demand declined 1.1 percent for 2016 with unseasonably warm weather in november and december after climbing by 4.9 percent in 2014. market demand increases for gasoline and distillate generally increase the product margin we can realize. the gross margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile and has contributed substantially to speedway's gross margin. more than half of speedway's gross margin was derived from merchandise sales in 2015. speedway's convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise, including prepared foods, beverages and non-food items.
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. at december 31, 2015, market values for refined product inventories were lower than their lifo cost basis and, as a result, we recorded an inventory valuation charge of $25 million to cost of revenues to value these inventories at the lower of cost or market. based on movements of refined product prices, future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative or positive effect to earnings. such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover. in 2016, inventory market values have continued to decline and if they do not recover to december 31, 2015 levels by march 31, 2016, an additional inventory valuation charge would be required in first quarter 2016.

ngl and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand, as well as market uncertainty, availability of ngl transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. our profitability is directly affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at our own or third‐party processing plants, purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‐related prices and the cost of third‐party transportation and fractionation services. to the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling by our producer customers, such prices also affect profitability.
the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. a majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common carrier pipelines serve our refining & marketing segment. the volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines. key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. the volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines. in most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from may through september of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. as with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements.

net income attributable to mpc increased $328 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $412 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to our refining & marketing segment income from operations, which increased $577 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and $403 million in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase in refining & marketing segment income from operations in 2015 was primarily due to higher crack spreads, favorable effects of changes in market structure on crude oil acquisition prices, more favorable net product price realizations compared to spot market reference prices and lower direct
57
operating costs. these positive impacts were partially offset by unfavorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to benchmark lls crude oil, the unfavorable effect of lower commodity prices on volumetric gains and an lcm inventory valuation charge of $345 million.  the increase in 2014 was primarily due to more favorable net product price realizations and higher usgc and chicago crack spreads, partially offset by narrower crude oil differentials and higher turnaround and other direct operating costs.
sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) decreased $25.77 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 and $2.34 billion in 2014 compared to 2013. the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to lower refined product sales prices partially offset by increases in refined product sales volumes.the decrease in 2014 was primarily due to lower refined product sales prices, partially offset by an increase in refined product sales volumes and higher merchandise sales for our speedway segment primarily attributable to the convenience stores acquired along the east coast and southeast. mpc consolidated refined product sales increased 163 mbpd in 2015 compared to 2014 and 52 mbpd in 2014 compared to 2013.
income from equity method investments decreased $65 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $117 million in 2014 compared to 2013. the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to decreases in income from our ethanol affiliates of $69 million, mainly due to lower ethanol prices. the increase in 2014 was primarily due to increases in income from our ethanol affiliates of $68 million and income from our pipeline affiliates of $49 million. the increase in income from our ethanol affiliates includes the affects of our acquisition of interests in taae, tace and taei in august 2013. the higher income from our pipeline affiliates is primarily due to increases from loop and explorer, which is now accounted for as an equity method investment following our acquisition of an increased ownership interest in this pipeline company.
net gain on disposal of assets decreased $14 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $15 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to the sale of two terminals and terminal assets in 2014.
other income increased $1 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and $59 million in 2014 compared to 2013. other income in 2015 was comparable to 2014. the increase in 2014 was primarily due to higher gains on sales of excess rins of $74 million, partially offset by an $11 million impairment in 2014 of an investment in a company accounted for using the cost method.
cost of revenues decreased $28.19 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 and decreased $3.63 billion in 2014 compared to 2013. the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to:
•   a decrease in refined product cost of sales of $32.2 billion, primarily due to a decrease in our average crude oil costs of $43.97 per barrel, partially offset by an increase in refined product sales volumes; and
•   decreases in refinery direct operating costs of $726 million, or $1.40 per barrel of total refinery throughput, primarily due to significantly lower turnaround activity in 2015 and decreases in other manufacturing costs.
the decrease in 2014 was primarily due to:
•   a decrease in refined product cost of sales of $5.01 billion, primarily due to a decrease in our average crude oil costs of $9.30 per barrel, partially offset by an increase in refined product sales volumes;
•   partially offset by a increase in refinery direct operating costs of $913 million, or $1.37 per barrel of total refinery throughput, which included costs associated with significant planned turnaround activity; and
•   an increase in merchandise cost of sales for our speedway segment of $327 million, primarily attributable to the convenience stores acquired from hess.
purchases from related parties decreased $197 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $148 million in 2014 compared 2013. the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to decreases in prices and volumes of ethanol purchases from tame, tace and taae of $149 million, decreases in volumes purchased from loop of $36 million and decreases in volumes purchased from explorer of $19 million. the increase in 2014 was primarily due to acquisitions of ownership interests in taae in august 2013 and explorer in march 2014, resulting in purchases from these companies totaling $118 million in 2014 and $24 million in 2013, being reported as purchases from related parties while purchases from these companies prior to these acquisitions were reported as cost of revenues. in addition, we also had an increase in purchases from loop of $45 million in 2014.
consumer excise taxes increased $1.01 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 and $422 million in 2014 compared 2013, primarily due to increases in taxable refined product sales volumes, including the effects of the acquisition of hess' retail operations and related assets.
58
depreciation and amortization increased $320 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and $106 million in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to an impairment charge of $144 million related to the cancellation of the roux project at our garyville refinery and the depreciation of the fair value of assets acquired along the east coast and southeast on september 30, 2014 by our speedway segment. the increase in 2014 was primarily due to completion of certain capital investments at our galveston bay refinery, an increase in the number of convenience stores in our speedway segment and the implementation of corporate-level information technology projects, partially offset by an impairment of a light products terminal in 2013.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $201 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and $127 million in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to increases in employee benefit costs, contract services and additional expenses related to the convenience stores acquired along the east coast and southeast, partially offset by a decrease in pension settlement expenses. the increase in 2014 was primarily due to increases in contract services, employee compensation and benefit expenses and credit card processing fees.
other taxes increased $1 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $50 million in 2014 compared to 2013. other taxes in 2015 were comparable to 2014. the increase in the 2014 was primarily due to increases in property taxes of $30 million, payroll taxes of $27 million and environmental taxes of $11 million, partially offset by decreases in other tax expenses. these increases were attributable to a number of factors including the acquisitions of the galveston bay refinery and related assets and hess' retail operations and related assets and the absence of a federal oil spill tax refund received in 2013.
net interest and other financial costs increased $102 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and $37 million in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to senior notes issued by mpc in september 2014 to finance the acquisition of hess' retail operations and related assets, higher levels of borrowings on mplx's bank revolving credit facility used to fund the acquisition of pipe line holdings and interest on the debt assumed from markwest. the increase in 2014 was primarily due to an increase in long-term debt related to the acquisition of hess' retail operations and related assets and mplx's acquisition of additional interest in pipe line holdings. we capitalized interest of $37 million in 2015, $27 million in 2014 and $28 million in 2013. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 19 for further details.
provision for income taxes increased $226 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and $167 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to our income before income taxes, which increased $539 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and $589 million in 2014 compared to 2013. the effective tax rates in 2015, 2014 and 2013 are slightly less than the u.s. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent benefit differences, including the domestic manufacturing deduction, partially offset by state and local tax expense. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 12 for further details.

refining & marketing segment income from operations increased $577 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $403 million in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase in refining & marketing segment income from operations in 2015 was  primarily due to higher crack spreads, favorable effects of changes in market structure on crude oil acquisition prices, more favorable net product price realizations compared to spot market reference prices and lower direct operating costs. these positive impacts were partially offset by unfavorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to benchmark lls crude oil, the unfavorable effect of lower commodity prices on volumetric gains and an lcm inventory valuation charge of $345 million. the increase in 2014 was primarily due to more favorable net product price realizations and higher usgc and chicago crack spreads, partially offset by narrower crude oil differentials and higher turnaround and other direct operating costs.
the following table presents certain market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our refining & marketing segment's business.

based on the market indicators above and our refinery throughputs, we estimate the following impacts on refining & marketing segment income from operations for 2015 compared to 2014 and for 2014 compared to 2013:
•   the chicago lls 6-3-2-1 crack spread increased $1.11 per barrel in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $1.40 in 2014 compared to 2013, which had positive impacts on segment income of $400 million and $354 million, respectively.
•   the usgc lls 6-3-2-1 crack spread increased $1.88 per barrel in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $0.99 per barrel in 2014 compared to 2013 which had positive impacts on segment income of $940 million and $407 million, respectively.
61
•   the lls-wti crude oil differential narrowed $0.40 per barrel in 2015 compared to 2014. this decrease was offset by an increase in volume resulting in a positive impact on segment income of $6 million. the lls-wti crude oil differential narrowed $5.34 per barrel in 2014 compared to 2013, which had negative impacts on segment income of $695 million.
•   the sweet/sour crude oil differential narrowed $0.87 per barrel in 2015 compared to 2014 and $1.56 per barrel in 2014 compared to 2013, which had negative impacts on segment income of $27 million and $489 million, respectively.
the market indicators shown above use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and products sold. differences in our results compared to these market indicators, including product price realizations, mix and crude costs as well as the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices, and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, had an estimated negative impact on refining & marketing segment income of $1.03 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 and an estimated positive impact $1.35 billion in 2014 compared to 2013. we estimate the negative impact for 2015 was primarily due to unfavorable crude oil acquisition costs relative to lls, the unfavorable effect of lower commodity prices on volumetric gains, the price differential of charge and blend stock relative to crude oil and the lcm inventory valuation charge, partially offset by changes in market structure and refined product selling prices. we estimate the positive impact for 2014 was primarily due to more favorable net product price realizations as compared to spot market values and a lifo accounting benefit.
in the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a lifo charge of $45 million as a result of decreased levels in refined products and crude inventory volumes. since the lifo costs for these layers were based on 2014 costs, the liquidation of these layers resulted in a charge to income. in the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized builds in our refined product and crude inventories. these builds were based on 2014 costs which were significantly higher than fourth quarter 2014 costs and resulted in a benefit of approximately $240 million to income. for the full year, we recognized a lifo charge of $78 million in 2015 as compared to lifo benefits of $265 million in 2014 and $135 million in 2013.

refinery direct operating costs decreased $1.40 per barrel in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $1.37 per barrel in 2014 compared to 2013, which include a decrease in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs of $0.67 per barrel and an increase of $0.60 per barrel, respectively, and a decrease in other manufacturing costs of $0.71 per barrel and an increase of$0.72 per barrel, respectively. the decrease in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs for 2015 was primarily attributable to the galveston bay, robinson and garyville refineries, partially offset by an increase at the detroit refinery. the increase in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs for 2014 was primarily attributable to the galveston bay, robinson and catlettsburg refineries, partially offset by decreases at the garyville and canton refineries. the decrease in other manufacturing costs was primarily attributable to lower energy costs and routine maintenance costs for 2015. the increase in other manufacturing costs was primarily attributable to higher energy costs, catalyst expenses and routine maintenance costs for 2014.
we purchase rins to satisfy a portion of our rfs2 compliance. our expenses associated with purchased rins were $212 million in 2015, $141 million in 2014 and $264 million in 2013. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to a $46 million charge in the second quarter to recognize increased estimated costs for compliance based on the renewable fuel standards for 2014 and 2015 proposed by the epa in may 2015 and finalized in november 2015, particularly those for bio-mass based diesel and advanced biofuels. the remaining increase was primarily due to increased purchases of biomass based diesel rins, at an increased average cost in 2015 as compared to 2014, partially offset by decreased purchases of ethanol rins, at a decreased average cost in 2015 as compared to 2014. the decrease in 2014 was primarily due to decreases in the average cost of ethanol and biomass-based biodiesel rins and decreases in our estimated advanced biofuel and ethanol obligation volumes.
speedway segment income from operations increased $129 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and $169 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to increases in our gasoline and distillate gross margin of $401 million and $246 million, respectively, and increases in our merchandise gross margin of $393 million and $150 million, respectively, partially offset by higher operating expenses. the increases were primarily attributable the full year effect of the locations acquired along the east coast and southeast on september 30, 2014. the increases in merchandise gross margin were related to a combination of higher merchandise and food sales and improved margins. in the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized an lcm inventory valuation charge of $25 million.
the following table includes margin statistics for the speedway segment.

midstream segment income from operations increased $9 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $70 million in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to the financial results of markwest, which are reflected in midstream segment income from the december 4, 2015 markwest merger date, partially offset by $30 million of transaction costs. the increase in 2014 was primarily due to higher pipeline transportation revenue and an increase in income from our pipeline affiliates, which was primarily attributable to our investment in loop, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses primarily attributable to the proposed cornerstone pipeline project and pipeline maintenance costs.
corporate and other unallocated expenses increased $22 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and $15 million in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to a lower allocation of employee benefit costs to the segments. the increase in 2014 was primarily due to costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of hess' retail operations and related assets in 2014.
unallocated items also included an impairment charge of $144 million recorded in the third quarter of 2015 related to the cancellation of the roux project at our garyville refinery. the charge reflects the write-off of all costs capitalized on the project through september 30, 2015, including front-end engineering and long lead time equipment. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 17 for additional information on the impairment.
we recorded pretax pension settlement expenses of $4 million in 2015, $96 million in 2014 and $95 million in 2013 resulting from the level of employee lump sum retirement distributions that occurred during these years.

net cash provided by operating activities increased $951 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to increased operating results, excluding non-cash charges such as the lcm inventory valuation charge and roux project impairment, partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital of $330 million compared to 2014. net cash provided by operating activities decreased $295 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to unfavorable changes in working capital of $892 million compared to 2013, partially offset by an increase in net income of $422 million and non-cash adjustments of $175 million. the above changes in working capital exclude changes in short-term debt.
for 2015, changes in working capital were a net $1.02 billion use of cash, primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by decreases in current receivables and inventories. changes from december 31, 2014 to december 31, 2015 per the consolidated balance sheets, excluding the impact of acquisitions, were as follows:
•   accounts payable decreased $1.92 billion from year-end 2014, primarily due to lower crude oil payable prices and volumes.
•   current receivables decreased $1.13 billion from year-end 2014, primarily due to lower refined product and crude oil receivable prices and lower crude oil receivable volumes.
•   inventories decreased $417 million from year-end 2014, primarily due to a $370 million lcm inventory valuation charge and lower refined product and crude oil inventory volumes.
for 2014, changes in working capital were a net $694 million use of cash, primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase in inventories, partially offset by a decrease in current receivables. excluding the impact of acquisitions, accounts payable decreased $1.65 billion from year-end 2013, primarily due to lower crude oil payable prices, partially offset by higher crude oil payable volumes; inventories decreased $796 million from year-end 2013, primarily due to higher refined product and crude oil inventory volumes; and current receivables decreased $1.63 billion from year-end 2013, primarily due to lower refined product and crude oil receivable prices.
for 2013, changes in working capital were a net $198 million source of cash, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by increases in current receivables and inventory volumes. accounts payable increased $1.45 billion from year-end 2012, primarily due to higher crude oil payable volumes, and current receivables increased $949 million from year-end 2012, primarily due to higher refined product receivable volumes attributable to an increase in refined product sales volumes. both of these increases are associated with the galveston bay refinery acquired in february 2013. changes in inventories were a $305 million use of cash in 2013, primarily due to higher refined product and crude oil inventory volumes.
cash flows used in investing activities decreased $1.10 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased $1.79 billion in 2014 compared to 2013. the investing activity is further discussed below.

(c)   includes capitalized interest of $37 million, $27 million and $28 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
the markwest merger comprised 85 percent of our total capital expenditures and investments, excluding capitalized interest, in 2015. the acquisition of hess' retail operations and related assets comprised 58 percent of our total capital expenditures and investments, excluding capitalized interest, in 2014. the acquisition of the galveston bay refinery and related assets comprised 49 percent of our total capital expenditures and investments, excluding capitalized interest, in 2013.
cash provided by disposal of assets totaled $21 million, $27 million and $16 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
net investments were a $327 million use of cash in 2015 compared to a $404 million use of cash in 2014 and a $74 million use of cash in 2013. the change in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in contributions to the sax pipeline project of $121 million and the 2014 investment in explorer, partially offset by contributions to crowley ocean partners of $72 million. the change in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to increases in contributions to the sandpiper and sax pipeline projects of $287 million and our investment in explorer of $77 million, partially offset by a return of capital from our ethanol affiliates of $9 million.
financing activities were a $987 million use of cash in 2015, a $635 million source of cash in 2014 and a $3.22 billion use of cash in 2013. the sources of cash in 2015 primarily consisted of net long-term borrowings. the sources of cash primarily consisted of net long-term debt borrowings in 2014 and proceeds from the issuance of mplx common units in 2014. the uses of cash in all three years primarily consisted of common stock repurchases and dividend payments. in addition, uses of cash in 2015 and 2014 included payments to the seller of the galveston bay refinery under the contingent earnout provisions of the purchase and sale agreement.
long-term debt borrowings and repayments were a net $767 million source of cash in 2015 compared to a $3.25 billion source of cash in 2014 and a $21 million use of cash in 2013. during 2015, we used $763 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of $1.5 billion of mpc senior notes to extinguish our obligation for the $750 million aggregate principal amount of

senior notes due in 2016 and mplx used proceeds from its issuance of $500 million aggregate of principal amount of mplx senior notes to repay $385 million outstanding under the mplx bank revolving credit facility. during 2014, we issued $1.95 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and borrowed $700 million under a term loan credit agreement to finance the acquisition of hess' retail operations and related assets. in addition, mplx had net borrowings of $635 million under its bank revolving credit agreement and term loan agreement. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 19 for additional information on our long-term debt.
cash used in common stock repurchases totaled $965 million in 2015, $2.13 billion in 2014 and $2.79 billion in 2013 associated with the share repurchase plans authorized by our board of directors. the table below summarizes our total share repurchases. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 9 for further discussion of the share repurchase plans.

cash used in dividend payments totaled $613 million in 2015, $524 million in 2014 and $484 million in 2013. the increases were primarily due to increases in our base dividend, partially offset by a decrease in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock as a result of share repurchases. dividends per share were $1.14 in 2015, $0.92 in 2014 and $0.77 in 2013.
cash proceeds from the issuance of mplx common units were $221 million in 2014. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 4 for further discussion of mplx.

(a)   excludes mplx's $2 billion bank revolving credit facility, which had $877 million of borrowings and $8 million of letters of credit outstanding as of december 31, 2015.
(b)   availability under our $1.0 billion trade receivables securitization facility is a function of refined product selling prices, which will be lower in a sustained lower price environment. as of january 31, 2016, eligible trade receivables supported borrowings of $507 million.
because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, including a commercial paper program, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, the repurchase of shares of our common stock, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.
mpc bank revolving credit facility - we have a $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility ("revolving credit facility") in place with a maturity date of september 14, 2017. our revolving credit facility includes letter of credit issuing capacity of up to $2.0 billion and swingline loan capacity of up to $100 million. we may increase our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility by up to an additional $500 million, subject to certain conditions including the consent of the lenders whose commitments would be increased. in addition, the maturity date may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods subject to the approval of lenders holding greater than 50 percent of the commitments then outstanding, provided that the commitments of any non-consenting lenders will terminate on the then-effective maturity date.
66
borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest, at our election, at either the adjusted libo rate (as defined in our revolving credit facility) plus a margin or the alternate base rate (as defined in our revolving credit facility) plus a margin. we are charged various fees and expenses in connection with our revolving credit facility, including administrative agent fees, commitment fees on the unused portion of our borrowing capacity and fees related to issued and outstanding letters of credit. the applicable margin to the benchmark interest rates and margin to the benchmark commitment fees payable under our revolving credit facility fluctuate from time-to-time based on the credit ratings.
there were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding at december 31, 2015.
trade receivables securitization facility - on december 18, 2013, we entered into a three-year, $1.3 billion trade receivables securitization facility ("trade receivables facility"), with a group of financial institutions that act as committed purchasers, conduit purchasers, letter of credit issuers and managing agents under the trade receivables facility. the trade receivables facility is evidenced by a receivables purchase agreement and a second amended and restated receivables sale agreement. in october 2015, we reduced the maximum capacity under the trade receivables facility from $1.3 billion to $1.0 billion.
the trade receivables facility consists of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, marathon petroleum company lp ("mpc lp"), selling or contributing on an on-going basis all of its trade receivables (including trade receivables acquired from marathon petroleum trading canada llc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of mpc lp), together with all related security and interests in the proceeds thereof, without recourse, to another wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary, mpc trade receivables company llc ("trc"), in exchange for a combination of cash, equity or a subordinated note issued by trc to mpc lp. trc, in turn, has the ability to finance its purchase of the receivables from mpc lp by selling undivided ownership interests in qualifying trade receivables, together with all related security and interests in the proceeds thereof, without recourse, to the purchasing group in exchange for cash proceeds. the trade receivables facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to $1.0 billion, provided that the aggregate credit exposure of the purchasing group, including outstanding letters of credit, may not exceed the lessor of $1.0 billion or the balance of our eligible trade receivables at any one time.
to the extent that trc retains an ownership interest in the receivables it has purchased or received from mpc lp, such interest will be included in our consolidated financial statements solely as a result of the consolidation of the financial statements of trc with those of mpc. the receivables sold or contributed to trc are available first and foremost to satisfy claims of the creditors of trc and are not available to satisfy the claims of creditors of mpc. trc has granted a security interest in all of its assets to the purchasing group to secure its obligations under the receivables purchase agreement.
proceeds from the sale of undivided percentage ownership interests in qualifying receivables under the trade receivables facility will be reflected as debt on our consolidated balance sheet. we will remain responsible for servicing the receivables sold to the purchasing group. trc pays floating-rate interest charges and usage fees on amounts outstanding under the trade receivables facility, if any, and certain other fees related to the administration of the facility and letters of credit that are issued and outstanding under the trade receivables facility.
as of december 31, 2015, eligible trade receivables supported borrowings of $668 million. there were no borrowings outstanding at december 31, 2015. availability under our trade receivables securitization facility is a function of refined product selling prices, which will be lower in a sustained lower price environment.
mplx credit agreement - mplx is party to a credit agreement, dated as of november 20, 2014, and amended as of october 27, 2015 ("mplx credit agreement"), providing for a $2 billion bank revolving credit facility with a maturity date of december 4, 2020 and an outstanding $250 million term loan facility with a maturity date of november 20, 2019.
the mplx credit agreement includes letter of credit issuing capacity of up to $250 million and swingline loan capacity of up to $100 million. the revolving borrowing capacity under the mplx credit agreement may be increased by up to an additional $500 million, subject to certain conditions, including the consent of the lenders whose commitments would increase. in addition, the maturity date of the bank revolving credit facility may be extended from time-to-time during its term to a date that is one year after the then-effective date, subject to the approval of lenders holding the majority of the loans and commitments then outstanding, provided that the commitments of any non-consenting lenders will be terminated on the then-effective maturity date.
the term loan facility was drawn in full on november 20, 2014. the maturity date for the term loan facility may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods subject to the consent of the lenders holding a majority of the outstanding term loan borrowings, provided that the portion of the term loan borrowings held by any non-consenting lenders will continue to be due and payable on the original then-effective date. the borrowings under this facility during 2015 were at an average interest rate of 1.7 percent.
67
borrowings under the mplx credit agreement bear interest, at our election, at either the adjusted libo rate or the alternate base rate (as defined in the mplx credit agreement) plus a specified margin. mplx is charged various fees and expenses in connection with the agreement, including administrative agent fees, commitment fees on the unused portion of the borrowing capacity and fees with respect to issued and outstanding letters of credit. the applicable margin to the benchmark interest rates and the commitment fees payable under the mplx credit agreement fluctuate from time-to-time based on mplx's credit ratings.
during 2015, mplx borrowed $992 million under the bank revolving credit facility, at an average interest rate of 1.6 percent, per annum, and repaid $500 million of these borrowings. at december 31, 2015, mplx had $877 million of borrowings and $8.0 million of letters of credit outstanding under the bank revolving credit facility, resulting in total unused loan availability of $1.1 billion.
we may also utilize a commercial paper program in the future to provide funding for short-term working capital needs. commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. as of december 31, 2015, we have no borrowings under a commercial paper program.
debt-to-total-capital ratio as described in further detail below, the increase in debt as of year-end 2015 compared to year-end 2014 was primarily related to debt assumed by mplx as part of the markwest merger and increased mpc borrowings. equity also increased primarily due to the issuance of mplx units with the markwest merger. our debt-to-total capital ratio (total debt to total debt-plus-equity) was 38 percent and 37 percent at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

equity - on december 4, 2015, mplx merged with markwest, whereby markwest became a wholly-owned subsidiary of mplx. each common unit of markwest issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the markwest merger was converted into a right to receive 1.09 common units of mplx representing limited partner interests in mplx, plus a one-time cash payment of $6.20 per unit. each class b unit of markwest outstanding immediately prior to the merger was converted into the right to receive one class b unit of mplx having substantially similar rights, including conversion and registration rights, and obligations that the class b units of markwest had immediately prior to the merger. the total fair value of the equity consideration issued by mplx resulted in a $7.3 billion increase to total equity based on the mplx closing price of $32.62 per unit as of december 3, 2015. of this amount, $5.8 billion was reflected as noncontrolling interest for the portion of mplx owned by the public and the remaining $1.5 billion was reflected as mpc equity on our balance sheet.
mpc senior notes - on december 14, 2015, we completed a public offering of $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes ("mpc senior notes"), consisting of $600 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2018, $650 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2020 and $250 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2045. the net proceeds from the offering of the mpc senior notes were $1.49 billion, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. we used approximately $763 million of the net proceeds from this offering to fund the extinguishment of our obligation for the $750 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.500% senior notes due 2016. as a result of the retirement of our 2016 senior notes, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $5 million. we intend to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include investments in and advances to our affiliates and subsidiaries, including mplx. interest on each series of mpc senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on june 15 and december 15, commencing on june 15, 2016.
the senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of ours and rank equally with all our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.

the term loan agreement, the mpc bank revolving credit facility and the mplx credit agreement contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types. the financial covenant included in the term loan agreement and the mpc bank revolving credit facility requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of consolidated net debt to total capitalization (as defined in the term loan agreement and the mpc bank revolving credit facility) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. as of december 31, 2015, we were in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of consolidated net debt to total capitalization of 0.33 to 1.00, as well as the other covenants contained in the term loan agreement and the mpc bank revolving credit facility.
the mplx credit agreement includes certain representations and warranties, affirmative and restrictive covenants and events of default that we consider to be usual and customary for an agreement of this type. the mplx credit agreement includes a financial covenant that requires mplx to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter to consolidated ebitda (both as defined in the mplx credit agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of no greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 for up to two fiscal quarters following certain acquisitions). consolidated ebitda is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period. other covenants restrict mplx and certain of its subsidiaries from incurring debt, creating liens on its assets and entering into transactions with affiliates. as of december 31, 2015, mplx was in compliance with the covenants contained in the mplx credit agreement, including a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda of 4.6 to 1.0.
our intention is to maintain an investment grade credit profile. as of december 31, 2015, the credit ratings on our and mplx's senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows.
company   rating agency           rating mpc       moody's                 baa2 (stable outlook)
standard &amp; poor's   bbb (stable outlook)
fitch                   bbb (stable outlook)
mplx      moody's                 baa3 (stable outlook)
standard &amp; poor's   bbb- (stable outlook)
fitch                   bbb- (stable outlook)
the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.
69
neither the revolving credit facility, the mplx credit agreement nor our trade receivables securitization facility contains credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. however, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings would increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under the revolving credit facility and our trade receivables securitization facility. in addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables securitization facility, impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services agreements.
capital requirements our board approved a 2016 capital spending and investment plan of $4.2 billion towards the end of 2015. in light of current market conditions and revisions to expected completion dates for certain projects, we expect 2016 capital spending and investments to be $3.0 billion, excluding capitalized interest. additional details related to expected 2016 capital spending and investments are discussed in the capital budget outlook section below.
pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement for the galveston bay refinery and related assets, we may be required to pay the seller a contingent earnout of up to $700 million over six years, subject to certain conditions. in june 2015, we paid bp $189 million for the second period's contingent earnout and have paid bp $369 million to-date for the first two year's contingent earnout. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes 5 and 17.
while we have no required contributions to our pension plans for 2016, we may make voluntary contributions at our discretion.
on february 1, 2016, our board of directors approved a 32 cents per share dividend, payable march 10, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on february 17, 2016.
since january 1, 2012, our board of directors has approved $10.0 billion in total share repurchase authorizations and we have repurchased a total of $7.24 billion of our common stock, leaving $2.76 billion available for repurchases as of december 31, 2015. under these authorizations, we have acquired 198 million shares at an average cost per share of $36.65.
we may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be effected through rule 10b5-1 plans. the timing and amount of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.
the above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to our capital requirements. forward-looking statements about our capital requirements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in our forward-looking statements regarding capital requirements include the availability of liquidity; changes to the expected construction costs and timing of pipeline projects; continued/further volatility in and/or degradation of market and industry conditions; the availability and pricing of crude oil and other feedstocks; slower growth in domestic and canadian crude supply; the effects of the lifting of the u.s. crude oil export ban; completion of pipeline capacity to areas outside the u.s. midwest; consumer demand for refined products; transportation logistics; the reliability of processing units and other equipment; mpc's ability to successfully implement growth opportunities; the market price of our common stock; modifications to mplx earnings and distribution growth objectives; federal and state environmental, economic, health and safety, energy and other policies and regulations; mpc's ability to successfully achieve the strategic and other expected objectives relating to the markwest merger. these factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. for additional information on forward-looking statements and risks that can affect our business, see "disclosures regarding forward-looking statements" and item 1a. risk factors in this annual report on form 10-k.

(h)   primarily includes obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance, which we have estimated through 2024. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 22.
off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to indemnities and guarantees that are described below. although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on them to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources.
we have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. in conjunction with the spinoff, we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to marathon oil. these arrangements are described in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 25.
capital budget outlook we expect to spend $3.0 billion in 2016 on capital projects and investments, excluding capitalized interest and any acquisitions we may make. this represents a 23 percent increase from our 2015 spending due to additional midstream capital spending resulting from the markwest merger. the budget includes spending on refining, retail marketing and midstream projects as well as amounts designated for corporate activities. we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.
refining & marketing the refining & marketing segment's forecasted 2016 capital spending and investments is $1.3 billion, which includes approximately $250 million for midstream related assets, approximately $375 million for refining margin enhancement projects and approximately $675 million for refinery-sustaining capital. a number of these projects span multiple years.
71
the $250 million forecasted for midstream related assets includes contributions to our ocean vessel equity affiliate as well as a number of projects in our terminal, transportation and rail operations.
the $375 million forecasted for refining margin enhancement projects includes 2016 spending on the star program. the forecast also includes investments in the fcc units at our garyville and detroit refineries to increase our capacity to produce higher value alkylate and light products. at our galveston bay refinery, we will complete a hydrocracker project designed to increase our ulsd production by nine mbpd by shifting yields from gasoline. at our robinson refinery, we expect to complete a project to increase the light crude oil processing capacity by 30 mbpcd in 2016, which will allow it to run 100 percent light crude oil. we will complete another project at our galveston bay refinery in mid-2016 which will increase export capabilities approximately 30 mbpd. we have another project at our galveston bay refinery to further increase export capabilities by 115 mbpd by 2018 for a total increase of 145 mbpd.
the remaining $675 million budget is primarily allocated to maintaining facilities and meeting regulatory requirements at our refineries.
speedway the speedway segment's 2016 capital forecast of approximately $300 million is focused on store remodels, particularly remodels of its recently converted stores along the east coast, and building new stores in speedway's core markets. the forecast includes approximately $140 million for store conversions and remodels, which will drive incremental merchandise sales. the remaining budget is primarily for new convenience store construction and land acquisition to expand our markets and remodeling and rebuilding projects to upgrade and enhance our existing facilities. also included in the capital budget are expenditures for technology, equipment and dispenser upgrades. we intend to continue growing speedway's sales and profitability by focusing on the conversion and integration of acquired locations, from which we expect to realize increased merchandise sales and other synergies. we also remain focused on organic growth through remodeling stores, constructing new stores, rebuilding old stores, acquiring high quality stores through opportunistic acquisitions and improving margins at our existing operations. we have identified numerous opportunities for new convenience stores or store rebuilds in our existing market, pennsylvania and tennessee, as well as growth opportunities in georgia, south carolina and the florida panhandle.
midstream the midstream segment's forecasted 2016 capital spend of $1.3 billion, including $1.1 billion for mplx which represents the mid-point of the growth capital spending forecast of $800 million to $1.2 billion plus approximately $60 million for maintenance capital spending. mplx is focused on projects attributed to markwest's ongoing development of natural gas and gas liquids infrastructure to support its producer customers, particularly those in the marcellus and utica shale regions. markwest is a wholly-owned subsidiary of mplx.
mplx is continuing its development of the cornerstone pipeline project to connect utica shale production in southeastern ohio to our canton refinery and related build-out opportunities, which is expected to cost approximately $230 million, $46 million of which has been spent to date, and is anticipated to be operational late in 2016.
corporate and other the remaining 2016 capital forecast includes $95 million, primarily related to an expansion project for our corporate headquarters and upgrades to information technology systems.

our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. if this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors, including cash provided by operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. the discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forward-looking statements regarding expected capital and investment spending, costs for projects under construction, project completion dates and expectations or projections about strategies and goals for growth, upgrades and expansion. the forward-looking statements about our capital and investment budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for crude oil and refinery feedstocks and refined products, actions of competitors, delays in obtaining necessary third-party approvals, changes in labor, materials, and equipment costs and availability, planned and unplanned outages, the delay of, cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects, project cost overruns, disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations. these factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. for additional information on forward-looking statements and risks that can affect our business, see "disclosures regarding forward-looking statements" and item 1a. risk factors in this annual report on form 10-k.
transactions with related parties we believe that transactions with related parties were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 7 for discussion of activity with related parties.
environmental matters and compliance costs we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. if these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. however, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.
legislation and regulations pertaining to fuel specifications, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including costs of compliance and permitting delays. the extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered, the costs and the time frames for compliance, and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers. for additional information see item 1a. risk factors.
our environmental expenditures, including non-regulatory expenditures, for each of the last three years were:

(a)   based on the american petroleum institute's definition of environmental expenditures.
(b)   these amounts include spending charged against remediation reserves, where permissible, but exclude non-cash provisions recorded for environmental remediation.
we accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required.
73
new or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. we believe we comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed.
our environmental capital expenditures accounted for nine percent, five percent and four percent of capital expenditures excluding the markwest merger and the acquisitions of the galveston bay refinery and related assets and hess' retail operations and related assets in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. our environmental capital expenditures are expected to approximate $356 million, or twelve percent, of total capital expenditures in 2016. predictions beyond 2016 can only be broad-based estimates, which have varied, and will continue to vary, due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements, the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies, among other matters. based on currently identified projects, we anticipate that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately $539 million in 2017; however, actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed.
for more information on environmental regulations that impact us, or could impact us, see item 1. business - environmental matters, item 1a. risk factors and item 3. legal proceedings.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.
fair value estimates fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. there are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach, each of which includes multiple valuation techniques. the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. the income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts. the cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. this is often referred to as current replacement cost. the cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence.
the fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques. these standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques. inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority. the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
•   level 1 - observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date. active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
•   level 2 - observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. these are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date.
•   level 3 - unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management's best estimate of fair value.
74
valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. the assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy. we use a market or income approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to use the best information available. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 17 for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements.
significant uses of fair value measurements include:
•   assessment of impairment of long-lived assets;
•   assessment of impairment of intangible assets:
•   assessment of impairment of goodwill;
•   assessment of impairment of equity method investments;
•   recorded values for acquisitions; and
•   recorded values of derivative instruments.
impairment assessments of long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill and equity method investments fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our long-lived assets, goodwill and equity method investments for impairment is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate. significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions. significant assumptions include:
•   future margins on products produced and sold. our estimates of future product margins are based on our analysis of various supply and demand factors, which include, among other things, industry-wide capacity, our planned utilization rate, end-user demand, capital expenditures and economic conditions. such estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews.
•   future volumes. our estimates of future refinery, pipeline throughput and natural gas and ngl processing volumes are based on internal forecasts prepared by our refining &amp; marketing and midstream segments operations personnel.
•   discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. we apply a discount rate to our cash flows based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. this discount rate is also compared to recent observable market transactions, if possible. a higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows.
•   future capital requirements. these are based on authorized spending and internal forecasts.
we base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable. however, actual results may differ from these projections.
the need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for products produced, a poor outlook for profitability, a significant reduction in pipeline throughput volumes, a significant reduction in natural gas or ngls processed, significant reduction in refining margins, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which the asset or equity method investment is located.
long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable based on the expected undiscounted future cash flow of an asset group. for purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is the refinery and associated distribution system level for refining & marketing segment assets, site level for speedway segment convenience stores, the plant level or pipeline system level and the customer relationship for our customer contract intangibles for midstream segment assets. if the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group, fair value is calculated, and the carrying value is written down if greater than the calculated fair value.
unlike long-lived assets, goodwill and intangibles must be tested for impairment at least annually, or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. at december 31, 2015, we had a total of $4.0 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. the fair value of our reporting units exceeded book value for each of our reporting units in 2015.
the carrying values of certain reporting units in our midstream segment equaled their fair values as of the date of the markwest merger. any decrease in the fair value of these reporting units going forward could result in an impairment charge to the approximate $2.5 billion of goodwill recorded in connection with the markwest merger.

in february of 2016, mplx common units were trading at a price per unit which is significantly lower than the price per unit used to calculate the merger consideration and the resulting goodwill that was assigned to certain reporting units in our midstream segment.
the significant assumptions which were used to develop the estimates of the fair values recorded in acquisition accounting and the resulting goodwill assigned to the reporting units included discount rates, growth rates and customer attrition rates. if mplx experiences negative events related to these assumptions or if the market price of mplx common units continues to trade at a low level in 2016, mplx may need to assess whether this is a change in circumstances that indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units to which they assigned goodwill in connection with the markwest merger is less than their carrying value and, if so, evaluate goodwill for impairment.
equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value. factors providing evidence of such a loss include the fair value of an investment that is less than its carrying value, absence of an ability to recover the carrying value or the investee's inability to generate income sufficient to justify our carrying value. at december 31, 2015, we had $3.62 billion of investments in equity method investments recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.
an estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions (e.g., pricing, volumes and discount rates) that can materially affect our estimates. that is, unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions.
centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 that has continued through 2015. at december 31, 2015, centennial was not shipping product. as a result, we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in centennial. we concluded that no impairment was required given our assessment of its fair value based on market participant assumptions for various potential uses and future cash flows of centennial's assets. if market conditions were to change and the owners of centennial are unable to find an alternative use for the assets, there could be a future impairment of our centennial interest. as of december 31, 2015, our equity investment in centennial was $37 million and we had a $34 million guarantee associated with 50 percent of centennial's outstanding debt. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 25 for additional information on the debt guarantee.
the above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to the carrying value of our centennial equity investment. factors that could affect the carrying value of our centennial equity investment include, but are not limited to, a change in business conditions, a further decline or improvement in the long-term outlook of the potential uses of centennial's assets and the pursuit of different strategic alternatives for such assets. these factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
acquisitions in accounting for business combinations, acquired assets and liabilities and contingent consideration are recorded based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. the excess or shortfall of the purchase price when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill or a bargain purchase gain, respectively. a significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, contingent consideration and other assets and liabilities. we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for certain acquisitions, engage third-party consultants for assistance.
the fair value of assets and liabilities, including contingent consideration, as of the acquisition date are often estimated using a combination of approaches, including the income approach, which requires us to project related future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount rate; the cost approach, which requires estimates of replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence estimates; and the market approach which uses market data and adjusts for entity-specific differences. the estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value.
for the customer contract intangibles for our midstream segment, we must estimate the expected life of the relationships with our customers on an individual basis. the estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value.

the fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay to bp is re-measured each quarter using an income approach, with changes in fair value recorded in cost of revenues. the amount of cash to be paid under the arrangement is based on both a market-based crack spread and refinery throughput volumes for the months during which the contract applies, as well as established thresholds that cap the annual and total payment. we used internal and external forecasts for the crack spread and internal forecasts for refinery throughput volumes and applied an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate to the range of cash flows indicated by various scenarios to determine the fair value of the arrangement. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 5 for additional information on our acquisitions. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 17 for additional information on fair value measurements.
derivatives we record all derivative instruments at fair value. substantially all of our commodity derivatives are cleared through exchanges which provide active trading information for identical derivatives and do not require any assumptions in arriving at fair value. fair value estimation for all our derivative instruments is discussed in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 17. additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
variable interest entities we evaluate all legal entities in which we hold an ownership or other pecuniary interest to determine if the entity is a vie. our interests in a vie are referred to as variable interests. variable interests can be contractual, ownership or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the vie's assets. when we conclude that we hold an interest in a vie we must determine if we are the entity's primary beneficiary. a primary beneficiary is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a vie. this controlling financial interest is evidenced by both (a) the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie. we consolidate any vie when we determine that we are the primary beneficiary. we must disclose the nature of any interests in a vie that is not consolidated.
significant judgment is exercised in determining that a legal entity is a vie and in evaluating our interest in a vie. we use primarily a qualitative analysis to determine if an entity is a vie. we evaluate the entity's need for continuing financial support; the equity holder's lack of a controlling financial interest; and/or if an equity holder's voting interests are disproportionate to its obligation to absorb expected losses or receive residual returns. we evaluate our interests in a vie to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary. we use a primarily qualitative analysis to determine if we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in the vie, either on a standalone basis or as part of a related party group. we continually monitor our interests in legal entities for changes in the design or activities of an entity and changes in our interests, including our status as the primary beneficiary to determine if the changes require us to revise our previous conclusions.
markwest utica emg, a natural gas and ngl processing joint venture, is a vie; however, we are not considered to be the primary beneficiary. as a result, it is accounted for under the equity method. changes in the design or nature of the activities of this entity, or our involvement with the entity, may require us to reconsider our conclusions on the entity's status as a vie and/or our status as the primary beneficiary. such reconsideration requires significant judgment and understanding of the organization. this could result in the consolidation of the entity which would have a significant impact on our financial statements. ohio gathering is a subsidiary of markwest utica emg and is a vie. if we were to consolidate markwest utica emg, ohio gathering would need to be assessed for consolidation or deconsolidation.
variable interest entities are discussed in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 6 .
pension and other postretirement benefit obligations accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following:
•   the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations;
•   the expected long-term return on plan assets;
•   the rate of future increases in compensation levels;
•   health care cost projections; and
•   the mortality table used in determining future plan obligations.

we utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. we have selected different discount rates for our funded pension plans and our unfunded retiree health care plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns. the selected rates are compared to various similar bond indexes for reasonableness. in determining the assumed discount rates, we use our third-party actuary's discount rate model. this model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from aa bond yields. the yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. the bonds used have an average rating of aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and generally only non-callable bonds are included. outlier bonds that have a yield to maturity that deviate significantly from the average yield within each maturity grouping are not included. each issue is required to have at least $250 million par value outstanding.
of the assumptions used to measure the year-end obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. decreasing the discount rates of 3.65 percent for our pension plans and 4.15 percent for our other postretirement benefit plans by 0.25 percent would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by $42 million and $32 million, respectively, and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by $2 million and $4 million, respectively.
the long-term asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (currently targeted at approximately 51 percent equity securities and 49 percent fixed income securities for the primary funded pension plan), past performance and other factors. certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation and returns. in addition, our long-term asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to historical returns for reasonableness. after evaluating activity in the capital markets, along with the current and projected plan investments, we reduced the asset rate of return for our primary plan from 7.00 percent to 6.75 percent effective for 2015. we used the 7.00 percent long-term rate of return to determine our 2014 defined benefit pension expense. decreasing the 6.75 percent asset rate of return assumption by 0.25 percent would increase our defined benefit pension expense by $4 million.
compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans.
health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends.
we utilized the 2015 mortality tables from the u.s. society of actuaries.

overview the following discussion highlights significant factors influencing the consolidated financial position and results of operations of the allstate corporation (referred to in this document as "we," "our," "us," the "company" or "allstate"). it should be read in conjunction with the 5-year summary of selected financial data, consolidated financial statements and related notes found under part ii. item 6. and item 8. contained herein. further analysis of our insurance segments is provided in the property-liability operations (which includes the allstate protection and the discontinued lines and coverages segments) and in the allstate financial segment sections of management's discussion and analysis ("md&a"). the segments are consistent with the way in which we use financial information to evaluate business performance and to determine the allocation of resources. resources are allocated by the chief operating decision maker and performance is assessed for allstate protection, discontinued lines and coverages and allstate financial. allstate protection and allstate financial performance and resources are managed by committees of senior officers of the respective segments.
allstate is focused on the following priorities in 2016:
•   better serve our customers through innovation, effectiveness and efficiency;
•   achieve target economic returns on capital;
•   grow insurance policies in force;
•   proactively manage investments; and
•   build and acquire long-term growth platforms.
the most important factors we monitor to evaluate the financial condition and performance of our company include:
•   for allstate protection: premium, the number of policies in force ("pif"), new business sales, policy retention, price changes, claim frequency and severity, catastrophes, loss ratio, expenses, underwriting results, and relative competitive position.
•   for allstate financial: benefit and investment spread, asset-liability matching, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs ("dac"), expenses, operating income, net income, new business sales, invested assets, and premiums and contract charges.
•   for investments: exposure to market risk, asset allocation, credit quality/experience, total return, net investment income, cash flows, realized capital gains and losses, unrealized capital gains and losses, stability of long-term returns, and asset and liability duration.
•   for financial condition: liquidity, parent holding company level of deployable assets, financial strength ratings, operating leverage, debt levels, book value per share, and return on equity.
summary of results:
•   consolidated net income applicable to common shareholders was $2.06 billion in 2015 compared to $2.75 billion in 2014 and $2.26 billion in 2013. the decrease in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to higher property-liability insurance claims and claims expense and lower realized net capital gains and net investment income, partially offset by higher property-liability insurance premiums and decreased catastrophe losses and operating costs and expenses. the increase in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to lower loss on disposition related to the lincoln benefit life company ("lbl") sale recorded in allstate financial and loss on extinguishment of debt charges reported in corporate and other, partially offset by lower net income applicable to common shareholders from property-liability. net income applicable to common shareholders per diluted common share was $5.05, $6.27 and $4.81 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
•   allstate protection had underwriting income of $1.61 billion in 2015 compared to $1.89 billion in 2014 and $2.36 billion in 2013. the decrease in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to decreases in underwriting income in auto and commercial lines, partially offset by increases in underwriting income in homeowners and other personal lines and lower catastrophe losses. the decrease in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to decreases in underwriting income in homeowners, auto and other personal lines resulting from increased catastrophe losses. for a discussion on the components of the increase (decrease) in underwriting income, see the allstate protection segment section of the md&amp;a. the allstate protection combined ratio was 94.7, 93.5 and 91.5 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. underwriting income, a measure not based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"), is defined in the property-liability operations section of the md&amp;a.
•   allstate financial net income applicable to common shareholders was $663 million in 2015 compared to $631 million in 2014 and $95 million in 2013. the increase in 2015 primarily relates to higher net realized capital gains and lower loss on disposition related to the lbl sale, partially offset by lower net investment income and the reduction in business due to the sale of lbl. the increase in 2014 primarily relates to lower loss on disposition related to the lbl sale, partially offset by the associated reduction in business.

impact of low interest rate environment in december 2015, the federal open market committee ("fomc") began to tighten monetary policy by raising interest rates and setting the new target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 percent to 1/2 percent and maintained their inflation target of 2 percent. this was the first change in the target federal funds rate since december 2008. the fomc indicated that monetary policy remains accommodative after the increase, thereby supporting further improvements in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. the path of the federal funds rate increase will depend on economic conditions and outlook. we anticipate that interest rates will continue to increase but remain below historic averages for an extended period of time and that financial markets will continue to have periods of high volatility and less liquidity.
deferred annuity contracts and interest-sensitive life insurance policies with fixed and guaranteed crediting rates, or floors that limit crediting rate reductions, are adversely impacted by a prolonged low interest rate environment since we may not be able to reduce crediting rates sufficiently to maintain investment spreads. financial results of long duration products that do not have stated crediting rate guarantees but for which underlying assets may have to be reinvested at interest rates that are lower than portfolio rates, such as structured settlements and term life insurance, may also be adversely impacted. our investment strategy for structured settlements includes increasing investments in which we have ownership interests and a greater proportion of return is derived from idiosyncratic asset or operating performance. we stopped selling new fixed annuity products january 1, 2014 and structured settlement annuities march 22, 2013.
the following table summarizes the weighted average guaranteed crediting rates and weighted average current crediting rates as of december 31, 2015 for certain fixed annuities and interest-sensitive life contracts where management has the ability to change the crediting rate, subject to a contractual minimum. other products, including equity-indexed, variable and immediate annuities, equity-indexed and variable life, and institutional products totaling $5.95 billion of contractholder funds, have been excluded from the analysis because management does not have the ability to change the crediting rate or the minimum crediting rate is not considered meaningful in this context.

investing activity will continue to decrease our portfolio yield as long as market yields remain below the current portfolio yield. in the allstate financial segment, the portfolio yield has been less impacted by reinvestment in the current low interest rate environment, as much of the investment cash flows have been used to fund the managed reduction in spread-based liabilities. the declines in both invested assets and portfolio yield are expected to result in lower net investment income in future periods.
as of december 31, 2015, allstate financial has fixed income securities not subject to prepayment with an amortized cost of $22.86 billion and $4.04 billion of commercial mortgage loans, of which approximately 4.6% and 4.5%, respectively, are expected to mature in 2016. additionally, for asset-backed securities ("abs"), residential mortgage-backed securities ("rmbs") and commercial mortgage-backed securities ("cmbs") that have the potential for prepayment and are therefore not categorized by contractual maturity, we received periodic principal payments of $608 million in 2015. to the extent portfolio cash flows are reinvested into fixed income securities, the average pre-tax investment yield of 5.4% is expected to decline due to lower market yields. we shortened the maturity profile of the fixed income securities in allstate financial to make the portfolio less sensitive to rising interest rates. proceeds from the sale of longer duration fixed income securities that were invested in shorter duration fixed income securities and public equity securities are expected to lower net investment income and portfolio yields. over time, we will shift to performance-based investments in which a greater proportion of return is derived from idiosyncratic asset or operating performance, to more appropriately match the long-term nature of our immediate annuity liabilities and improve long-term economic results. we anticipate higher long-term returns on these investments.
as of december 31, 2015, property-liability has fixed income securities not subject to prepayment with an amortized cost of $28.53 billion and $296 million of commercial mortgage loans, of which approximately 9.5% and 36.3%, respectively, are expected to mature in 2016. additionally, for abs, rmbs and cmbs securities that have the potential for prepayment and are therefore not categorized by contractual maturity, we received periodic principal payments of $582 million in 2015. we have maintained a shorter maturity profile of the fixed income securities in property-liability so the portfolio is less sensitive to rising
31
interest rates. this approach to reducing interest rate risk resulted in realized capital gains in 2013, but contributed to lower portfolio yields as sales proceeds were invested at lower market yields. the portfolio yield will respond more quickly to changes in market interest rates as a result of its shorter maturity profile. the average pre-tax investment yield of 3.4% may decline to the extent reinvestment is at lower market yields.
in order to mitigate the unfavorable impact that the current and changing interest rate environment could have on investment results, we are:
•   managing our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a shorter maturity profile in the property-liability portfolio which will also result in the yield responding more quickly to changes in market interest rates.
•   reducing the risk that rising interest rates will negatively impact the value of fixed income securities by reducing the allstate financial portfolio maturity profile.
•   shifting the portfolio mix over time to have less reliance on investments whose returns come primarily from interest payments to investments in which we have ownership interests and a greater proportion of return is derived from idiosyncratic asset or operating performance.
•   investing for the specific needs and characteristics of allstate's businesses.
we expect volatility in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from changes in unrealized net capital gains and losses and unrecognized pension cost.
these topics are discussed in more detail in the respective sections of the md&a.

property-liability 2015 highlights
•   property-liability net income applicable to common shareholders was $1.69 billion in 2015 compared to $2.43 billion in 2014.
•   property-liability premiums written totaled $30.87 billion in 2015, an increase of 4.2% from $29.61 billion in 2014.
•   the property-liability loss ratio was 69.4 in 2015 compared to 67.2 in 2014.
•   catastrophe losses were $1.72 billion in 2015 compared to $1.99 billion in 2014.

•   property-liability underwriting income was $1.56 billion in 2015 compared to $1.77 billion in 2014. underwriting income, a measure not based on gaap, is defined below.
•   property-liability investments were $38.48 billion as of december 31, 2015, a decrease of 1.5% from $39.08 billion as of december 31, 2014. net investment income was $1.24 billion in 2015, a decrease of 4.9% from $1.30 billion in 2014.
•   net realized capital losses were $237 million in 2015 compared to net realized capital gains of $549 million in 2014.
property-liability operations overview our property-liability operations consist of two reporting segments: allstate protection and discontinued lines and coverages. allstate protection comprises three brands where we accept underwriting risk: allstate, esurance and encompass. allstate protection is principally engaged in the sale of personal property and casualty insurance, primarily private passenger auto and homeowners insurance, to individuals in the united states and canada. discontinued lines and coverages includes results from property-liability insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run-off. these segments are consistent with the groupings of financial information that management uses to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of resources.
underwriting income, a measure that is not based on gaap and is reconciled to net income applicable to common shareholders below, is calculated as premiums earned, less claims and claims expense ("losses"), amortization of dac, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges, as determined using gaap. we use this measure in our evaluation of results of operations to analyze the profitability of the property-liability insurance operations separately from investment results. it is also an integral component of incentive compensation. it is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance. net income applicable to common shareholders is the gaap measure most directly comparable to underwriting income. underwriting income should not be considered as a substitute for net income applicable to common shareholders and does not reflect the overall profitability of the business.
the table below includes gaap operating ratios we use to measure our profitability. we believe that they enhance an investor's understanding of our profitability. they are calculated as follows:
•   claims and claims expense ("loss") ratio - the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned. loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses.
•   expense ratio - the ratio of amortization of dac, operating costs and expenses, and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned.
•   combined ratio - the ratio of claims and claims expense, amortization of dac, operating costs and expenses, and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned. the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. the difference between 100% and the combined ratio represents underwriting income as a percentage of premiums earned, or underwriting margin.
we have also calculated the following impacts of specific items on the gaap operating ratios because of the volatility of these items between fiscal periods.
•   effect of catastrophe losses on combined ratio - the percentage of catastrophe losses included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned. this ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses.
•   effect of prior year reserve reestimates on combined ratio - the percentage of prior year reserve reestimates included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned. this ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses.

allstate protection segment overview and strategy  the allstate protection segment primarily sells private passenger auto and homeowners insurance to individuals through agencies and directly through contact centers and the internet. these products are marketed under the allstate®, esurance® and encompass® brand names.
our strategy is to position our products and distribution systems to meet the changing needs of the customer in managing the risks they face. this includes customers who want local advice and assistance and those who are self-directed. in addition, there are customers who are brand-sensitive and those who are brand-neutral. our strategy is to serve all four of these consumer segments with unique products and in innovative ways while leveraging our claims, pricing and operational capabilities. when we do not offer a product our customers need, we may make available non-proprietary products that meet their needs.
we utilize specific customer value propositions for each brand to improve our competitive position and performance. over time, delivering on these customer value propositions may include investments in resources and require significant changes to our products, service, capabilities and processes.
our strategy for the allstate brand centers around customers who prefer local personal advice and service and are brand-sensitive. our customer-focused strategy for the allstate brand aligns targeted marketing, product innovation, distribution effectiveness, and pricing toward acquiring and retaining an increased share of our target customers. this refers to consumers who want to purchase multiple products from one insurance provider including auto, homeowners and financial products, who potentially present more favorable prospects for profitability over the course of their relationships with us.
the allstate brand utilizes marketing delivered to target customers to promote our strategic priorities, with messaging that communicates the value of our "good hands®", the importance of having proper coverage by highlighting our comprehensive product and coverage options, and the ease of doing business with allstate and allstate agencies.
the allstate brand differentiates itself from competitors by offering a comprehensive range of innovative product options and features through a network of agencies that provide local advice and service. we are undergoing a focused multi-year effort to position agents, licensed sales professionals and financial specialists as trusted advisors to better serve customers who prefer local and personalized advice. this means they have a local presence that instills confidence; know their customers and understand the unique needs of their households; help them assess the potential risks they face; provide local expertise and personalized guidance on how to protect what matters most to them by offering customized solutions; and support them when they have changes in their lives and during their times of need. to ensure agencies have the resources, capacity and support needed to serve customers at this level, we are deploying education and support focused on relationship initiation and insurance and retirement expertise and are continuing efforts to enhance agency capabilities with customer-centric technology while simplifying and automating service processes to enable agencies to focus more time in an advisory role.
product features include allstate your choice auto® with options such as accident forgiveness, deductible rewards®, safe driving bonus® and new car replacement, and allstate house and home® that provides options of coverage for roof damage including graduated coverage and pricing based on roof type and age. in addition, we offer a claim satisfaction guaranteesm that promises a return of premium to allstate brand auto insurance customers dissatisfied with their claims experience. our drivewise® program, available in 48 states and the district of columbia as of december 31, 2015, uses a mobile application or an in-car device to capture driving behaviors and reward customers for driving safely. the drivewise mobile application also provides customers with information and tools to encourage safer driving and incentivize through driving challenges. beginning in 2015, drivewise offers allstate rewards®, a program that provides reward points for safe driving. we will continue to focus on developing and introducing products and services that benefit today's consumers and further differentiate allstate and enhance the customer experience. we plan to deepen customer relationships through value-added customer interactions and expanding our presence in households with multiple products by providing financial protection for customer needs. in certain areas with higher risk of catastrophes or where customers do not meet our standard underwriting profile, we offer a homeowners product from north light specialty insurance company ("north light"), our excess and surplus lines carrier that operates under different regulatory rules. when an allstate product is not available, we may make available non-proprietary products for customers through brokering arrangements. for example, in hurricane exposed areas, allstate agencies sell non-proprietary property insurance products to customers who prefer to use a single agent for all their insurance needs.
we are undergoing a focused effort to enhance our effectiveness and efficiency by implementing processes and standards to elevate the level and consistency of our customer experience. we continue to enhance technology to improve customer service, facilitate the introduction of new products and services, improve the handling of claims and reduce infrastructure costs related to supporting agencies. these actions and others are designed to optimize the effectiveness of our distribution and service channels by increasing the productivity of the allstate brand's exclusive agencies.
other personal lines sold under the allstate brand include renter, condominium, landlord, boat, umbrella and manufactured home insurance policies. commercial lines include insurance products for small business owners. other business lines include allstate roadside services that provides roadside assistance products, including good hands rescuesm; allstate dealer services
35
that provides service contracts and other products sold in conjunction with auto lending and vehicle sales transactions; and ivantage that is a general agency for allstate exclusive agencies.
our strategy for the esurance brand focuses on self-directed consumers. to best serve these customers, esurance develops its technology, website and mobile capabilities to continuously improve its hassle-free purchase and claims experience and offer innovative product options and features. esurance continues to develop additional products to complement its auto line of business and provide a more comprehensive solution to its customers. esurance also continues to invest in geographic expansion of its products. esurance expanded its homeowners products in 2015 from 14 to 25 states and renters from 19 to 20 states. esurance continues to focus on increasing its preferred driver mix, while raising marketing effectiveness to support growth and profitability. esurance's drivesense® program, available in 32 states as of december 31, 2015, enables participating customers to be eligible for discounts based on driving performance as measured by a device installed in the vehicle. esurance pay per mile® usage-based insurance product was piloted in september 2015 and gives customers flexibility to customize their insurance and pay based on the number of miles they drive.
our strategy for the encompass brand centers around offering broad coverage options specifically tailored to the mass affluent market while simplifying the insurance experience by packaging products into a single annual household ("package") policy with one premium, one bill, one policy deductible, one renewal date and one advisor - an independent insurance agent. these features appeal to the approximately 35 million mass affluent households in the u.s., with their higher average limits and preference for professional advice regarding coverage needs and risk solutions. package policies represent over 85% of premiums written where they are offered, with concentrations in suburban and urban areas throughout the country. package policies currently are not offered in massachusetts, north carolina and texas. in pursuit of this strategy and to achieve its financial objectives, encompass is partnering with dedicated independent agency professionals who understand the needs of our risk sensitive consumers. we are seeking to diversify through new business writings in states where the risk return opportunities meet our requirements, while aggressively executing pricing, underwriting, and other actions to manage risk and ensure adequate profitability.
answer financial, a personal lines insurance agency, serves self-directed, brand-neutral consumers who want a choice between insurance carriers and offers comparison quotes for auto and homeowners insurance from approximately 25 insurance companies through its website and over the phone. it receives commissions for this service.
our pricing and underwriting strategies and decisions for all of our brands are primarily designed to achieve appropriate returns along with enhancing our competitive position. our sophisticated pricing methodology allows us to attract and retain customers in multiple risk segments. a combination of underwriting information, pricing and discounts are also used to achieve a more competitive position. our pricing strategy involves marketplace pricing and underwriting decisions that are based on these risk evaluation factors and an evaluation of competitors to the extent permissible by applicable law.
we continue to manage our property catastrophe exposure with the goal of providing shareholders an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business and to reduce the variability of our earnings. our property business includes personal homeowners, commercial property and other property insurance lines. as of december 31, 2015, we have less than a 1% likelihood of exceeding average annual aggregate catastrophe losses by $2 billion, net of reinsurance, from hurricanes and earthquakes, based on modeled assumptions and applications currently available. the use of different assumptions and updates to industry models, and updates to our risk transfer program, could materially change the projected loss. our growth strategies include areas previously restricted where we believe we can earn an appropriate return for the risk and as a result our exposure may increase, but remain lower than $2 billion as noted above. in addition, we have exposure to severe weather events which impact catastrophe losses.
property catastrophe exposure management includes purchasing reinsurance to provide coverage for known exposure to hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires, fires following earthquakes and other catastrophes. we are also working to promote measures to prevent and mitigate losses and make homes and communities more resilient, including enactment of stronger building codes and effective enforcement of those codes, adoption of sensible land use policies, and development of effective and affordable methods of improving the resilience of existing structures.
pricing of property products is typically intended to establish returns that we deem acceptable over a long-term period. losses, including losses from catastrophic events and weather-related losses (such as wind, hail, lightning and freeze losses not meeting our criteria to be declared a catastrophe), are accrued on an occurrence basis within the policy period. therefore, in any reporting period, loss experience from catastrophic events and weather-related losses may contribute to negative or positive underwriting performance relative to the expectations we incorporated into the products' pricing. we pursue rate increases where indicated, taking into consideration potential customer disruption, the impact on our ability to market our auto lines, regulatory limitations, our competitive position and profitability, using a methodology that appropriately addresses the changing costs of losses from catastrophes such as severe weather and the net cost of reinsurance.

allstate protection outlook
•   allstate protection will continue to focus on its strategy of offering differentiated products and services to our customers while maintaining pricing discipline.
•   allstate protection will continue to take actions to improve auto profitability by increasing prices, evaluating underwriting standards, managing expenses, and managing loss cost through focus on claims process excellence.
•   allstate protection will continue to grow homeowners policies without significantly increasing catastrophe exposure.
•   we expect that volatility in the level of catastrophes we experience will contribute to variation in our underwriting results; however, this volatility will be mitigated due to our catastrophe management actions, including the purchase of reinsurance.
•   we will continue the implementation of our trusted advisor strategy, enabling agencies to more fully deliver on the allstate brand customer value proposition.
•   we will continue to modernize our operating model to efficiently deliver our customer value propositions.
•   we will invest in building and acquiring long-term growth platforms.
premiums written is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period. premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on a pro-rata basis over the policy period. the portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired term of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our consolidated statements of financial position.
a reconciliation of premiums written to premiums earned is shown in the following table.

premium measures and statistics that are used to analyze the business are calculated and described below.
•   pif: policy counts are based on items rather than customers. a multi-car customer would generate multiple item (policy) counts, even if all cars were insured under one policy.
•   average premium-gross written ("average premium"): gross premiums written divided by issued item count. gross premiums written include the impacts from discounts, surcharges and ceded reinsurance premiums and exclude the impacts from mid-term premium adjustments and premium refund accruals. average premiums represent the appropriate policy term for each line. allstate and esurance brands policy terms are 6 months for auto and 12 months for homeowners. encompass brand policy terms are 12 months for auto and homeowners.
•   renewal ratio: renewal policies issued during the period, based on contract effective dates, divided by the total policies issued 6 months prior for auto (12 months prior for encompass brand) or 12 months prior for homeowners.
•   new issued applications: item counts of automobiles or homeowners insurance applications for insurance policies that were issued during the period, regardless of whether the customer was previously insured by another allstate protection brand. allstate brand includes automobiles added by existing customers when they exceed the number allowed on a policy, which in 2014 and 2015 was either four or ten depending on the state. as of 2015 year-end, all states allow ten automobiles on a policy.

(1)   policy term is six months for allstate and esurance brands and twelve months for encompass brand.
(2)   rate changes that are indicated based on loss trend analysis to achieve a targeted return will continue to be pursued. rate changes do not include rating plan enhancements, including the introduction of discounts and surcharges that result in no change in the overall rate level in the state. these rate changes do not reflect initial rates filed for insurance subsidiaries initially writing business in a state. rate changes for allstate brand for the 2013 period exclude canada and specialty auto.
(3)   represents the impact in the states and canadian provinces where rate changes were approved during the period as a percentage of total brand prior year-end premiums written.
(4)   represents the impact in the states and canadian provinces where rate changes were approved during the period as a percentage of its respective total prior year-end premiums written in those same locations.
(5)   allstate brand operates in 50 states, the district of columbia, and 5 canadian provinces. esurance brand operates in 43 states and 1 canadian province. encompass brand operates in 40 states and the district of columbia. based on historical premiums written in those states and canadian provinces, rate changes approved for auto totaled $1.11 billion, $520 million and $379 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
(6)   2015 and 2014 includes 5 and 4 canadian provinces, respectively, and the district of columbia.
allstate brand auto premiums written totaled $18.45 billion in 2015, a 5.4% increase from $17.50 billion in 2014. factors impacting premiums written were the following:
•   2.1% or 410 thousand increase in pif as of december 31, 2015 compared to december 31, 2014. allstate brand auto pif increased in 39 states, including 8 out of our largest 10 states, as of december 31, 2015 compared to december 31, 2014.
•   2.3% decrease in new issued applications to 2,962 thousand in 2015 from 3,033 thousand in 2014. a change was implemented this year allowing a greater number of autos on a single policy, which reduced the new issued application growth rate by 3.2 points. without this change, new issued applications would have increased 0.9% in 2015 from 2014.
•   2.7% increase in average premium in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to rate increases. based on historical premiums written, rate changes approved for auto totaled $942 million in 2015 compared to $399 million in 2014. these amounts do not assume customer choices such as non-renewal or changes in policy terms which might reduce future premiums. fluctuation in the canadian exchange rate has reduced premiums written and average premium growth rates in 2015 by 0.7 points.
•   0.3 point decrease in the renewal ratio in 2015 compared to 2014.
we regularly monitor profitability trends and take appropriate pricing actions, underwriting actions, manage loss cost through focus on claims process excellence and targeted expense spending reductions to achieve adequate returns. given current loss trends, we have responded with a multi-faceted approach to improve profitability.
•   we increased and accelerated rate filings broadly across the country. approximately 30% of the allstate brand rate increases approved in 2015 were earned in 2015, with the remainder expected to be earned in 2016 and 2017. we continue to aggressively pursue rate increases to respond to higher loss trends, subject to regulatory processes and review.
•   we made underwriting guideline adjustments in geographic areas and customer segments experiencing less than acceptable returns which are reducing the number of new issued applications and slowing growth. underwriting guideline adjustments vary by geographic area and include restrictions on business with no prior insurance as well as business with prior accidents and violations. changes in down payment requirements and coverage plan adjustments have also been implemented. these changes are intended to increase underwriting margin and can be modified as we achieve targeted underwriting results in these segments.

______________________________
(1)   ratios are calculated using the premiums earned for the respective line of business.
auto loss ratio for the allstate brand increased 5.3 points in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to higher claim frequency and severity and unfavorable reserve reestimates, partially offset by increased premiums earned and decreased catastrophe losses. auto loss ratio for the allstate brand increased 0.7 points in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to increased catastrophe losses.
gross frequency is calculated as the number of claim notices received in the period divided by the average earned policies in force of the respective insurance coverage in force. the rate of change in gross frequency is the year over year percent increase or decrease in gross frequency for the period.
gross frequency in the bodily injury coverage increased 5.9% in 2015 compared to 2014. approximately 90% of individual states experienced a year over year increase in their rate of bodily injury gross frequency in 2015 when compared to 2014. gross frequency in the bodily injury coverage in 2014 was comparable to 2013.
gross frequency in the property damage coverage increased 6.3% in 2015 compared to 2014. approximately 95% of individual states experienced a year over year increase in their rate of property damage gross frequency in 2015 when compared to 2014. gross frequency in the property damage coverage increased 0.5% in 2014 compared to 2013. we continue to see an increase in miles driven in part due to increased employment, which has adversely impacted property damage gross frequency in 2015. other factors believed to be contributing to higher frequency are distracted driving and more technology in vehicles.

paid claim severity is calculated by dividing the sum of paid losses and loss expenses by claims closed with a payment during the period. the rate of change in paid severity is the year over year percent increase or decrease in paid claim severity for the period. bodily injury coverage paid claim severities decreased 1.6% and property damage coverage paid claim severities increased 4.4% in 2015 compared to 2014. changes in bodily injury and property damage paid claim severity increases were consistent with historical comparisons to inflationary indices, after adjusting for normal volatility due to changes in state mix and payment timing. bodily injury and property damage coverage paid claim severities increased 2.7% and 4.1%, respectively, in 2014 compared to 2013. severity results in 2014 increased in line with historical consumer price index trends.
esurance brand auto loss ratio decreased 1.5 points in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to increases in average premiums earned and lower catastrophe losses, partially offset by higher claim frequency and severity across several coverages. esurance brand auto loss ratio decreased 1.7 points in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to rate actions and favorable reserve reestimates related to personal injury protection losses.
encompass brand auto loss ratio decreased 0.1 points in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses and increased premiums earned. encompass brand auto loss ratio increased 3.6 points in 2014 compared to 2013, due to increased catastrophe losses and lower favorable reserve reestimates, partially offset by increased premiums earned.
homeowners loss ratio for the allstate brand decreased 3.1 points to 55.6 in 2015 from 58.7 in 2014, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses, decreased claim frequency excluding catastrophe losses and increased premiums earned. claim frequency excluding catastrophe losses decreased 2.3% in 2015 compared to 2014. paid claim severity excluding catastrophe losses increased 4.3% in 2015 compared to 2014. homeowners loss ratio for the allstate brand increased 5.3 points to 58.7 in 2014 from 53.4 in 2013, primarily due to higher catastrophe losses, partially offset by increased premiums earned. claim frequency excluding catastrophe losses decreased 0.3% in 2014 compared to 2013. paid claim severity excluding catastrophe losses increased 7.7% in 2014 compared to 2013.
encompass brand homeowners loss ratio decreased 9.8 points in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses and increased premiums earned. encompass brand homeowners loss ratio increased 18.4 points in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to higher catastrophe losses. several catastrophes occurred in areas where encompass has a higher concentration of policyholders in 2014.
catastrophe losses were $1.72 billion in 2015 compared to $1.99 billion in 2014 and $1.25 billion in 2013.
we define a "catastrophe" as an event that produces pre-tax losses before reinsurance in excess of $1 million and involves multiple first party policyholders, or a winter weather event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset, per-event threshold of average claims in a specific area, occurring within a certain amount of time following the event. catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds, winter storms and freezes, tornadoes, hailstorms, wildfires, tropical storms, hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanoes. we are also exposed to man-made catastrophic events, such as certain types of terrorism or industrial accidents. the nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be reliably predicted.

allstate brand expense ratio decreased 1.0 point in 2015 compared to 2014. the decrease primarily related to expense spending reductions in advertising and professional services costs, partially offset by an increase in the amortization of acquisition costs. expense reductions were primarily related to actions that could be modified as margins return to targeted underwriting results. amortization of dac primarily includes agent remuneration and premium taxes. allstate agency total incurred base commissions, variable compensation and bonuses in 2015 were higher than 2014.
allstate brand expense ratio decreased 0.6 points in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower advertising expenditures and lower employee related costs, including pension expense, partially offset by higher amortization of dac. amortization of dac increased in 2014 compared to 2013 and allstate agency total incurred base commissions, variable compensation and bonus was higher than 2013.
esurance brand expense ratio decreased 5.7 points in 2015 compared to 2014. esurance advertising expenses decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 in conjunction with our profitability actions. the esurance brand expense ratio also includes purchased intangible assets that are amortized on an accelerated basis with over 80% of the amortization taking place by 2016. other costs and expenses, including salaries of telephone sales personnel and other underwriting costs related to customer acquisition, were higher in 2015 than 2014.
esurance brand expense ratio increased 1.9 points in 2014 compared to 2013. esurance advertising expenses in 2014 were higher than 2013 due to increased spending related to the launch of a new advertising campaign, the homeowners advertising launch in 2014 and additional advertising to achieve short-term growth and long-term brand positioning. other costs and expenses, related to acquisition include salaries of telephone sales personnel and other underwriting costs, in 2014 were comparable to 2013.
esurance uses a direct distribution model, therefore its primary acquisition-related costs are advertising as opposed to commissions. esurance incurs substantially all of its acquisition costs in the year of policy inception. as a result, the esurance expense ratio will be higher during periods of increased advertising expenditures. esurance continued to invest in geographic expansion and additional products and capabilities. the expenses related to expansion initiatives contributed approximately 4.0 points in 2015 compared to 5.2 points to the total expense ratio in 2014. advertising expenses included 1.1 points in 2015 and 1.9 points in 2014 related to expansion initiatives. other costs and expenses included 2.9 points in 2015 and 3.3 points in 2014 related to expansion initiatives. expenses related to expansion initiatives includes costs incurred to expand beyond our initial 30 states at acquisition, adding new products such as homeowners, motorcycle, and usage based insurance and expanding into the canadian market. esurance's annual combined ratio is below 100, excluding amortization of purchased intangible assets, after the year of policy inception (in which substantially all acquisition costs are incurred), driven by pricing changes and customer mix. we manage the direct to consumer business based on its profitability over the life-time of the policy.
encompass brand expense ratio decreased 1.6 points in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to agency compensation, employee compensation and technology costs. expense improvement actions include reductions in technology and other costs, as
47
well as improving operating efficiency. the encompass brand dac amortization rate is higher on average than allstate brand dac amortization due to higher commission rates paid to independent agencies.
encompass brand expense ratio decreased 0.4 points in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower employee related costs, including pension expense, partially offset by higher amortization of dac.
dac    we establish a dac asset for costs that are related directly to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance policies, principally agents' remuneration and premium taxes. for the allstate protection business, dac is amortized to income over the period in which premiums are earned. the dac balance as of december 31 by brand and product type are shown in the following table.

catastrophe management historical catastrophe experience    for the last ten years, the average annual impact of catastrophes on our property-liability loss ratio was 7.7 points. the average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio for the last ten years was 31.1 points. over time, we have limited our aggregate insurance exposure to catastrophe losses in certain regions of the country that are subject to high levels of natural catastrophes. limitations include our participation in various state facilities, such as the california earthquake authority ("cea"), which provides insurance for california earthquake losses; the florida hurricane catastrophe fund, which provides reimbursements to participating insurers for certain qualifying florida hurricane losses; and other state facilities, such as wind pools. however, the impact of these actions may be diminished by the growth in insured values, and the effect of state insurance laws and regulations. in addition, in various states we are required to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations that provide insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers. because of our participation in these and other state facilities such as wind pools, we may be exposed to losses that surpass the capitalization of these facilities and to assessments from these facilities.
we have continued to take actions to maintain an appropriate level of exposure to catastrophic events while continuing to meet the needs of our customers, including the following:
•   continuing to limit or not offer new homeowners, manufactured home and landlord package policy business in certain coastal geographies.
•   increased capacity in our brokerage platform for customers not offered an allstate policy.
•   in 2015, north light, our surplus lines company that operates under different regulatory rules, expanded operations to one new state, bringing the total to 43 states.
•   in certain states, we have been ceding wind exposure related to insured property located in wind pool eligible areas.
•   we ceased writing new homeowners and landlord package policy business in california in 2007; however, later in 2016 we will start to write a limited number of homeowners policies in select areas of the state. meanwhile, we will continue to renew current policyholders and allow replacement policies for existing customers who buy a new home, or change their residence to rental property. for landlord package policies we allow replacement policies on an exception basis, and offer a small number of new landlord package policies in order to accommodate current personal umbrella policy customers.
•   north light, began writing homeowners in california in february 2013. any earthquake coverage provided under these writings (other than fire following earthquakes) is currently ceded via quota share reinsurance.
•   we ceased writing new homeowners business in florida in 2011 beyond a modest stance for existing customers who replace their currently-insured home with an acceptable property. the encompass companies operating in florida withdrew from the property lines in 2009.
•   tropical cyclone deductibles are in place for a large portion of coastal insured properties.
48
•   we have additional catastrophe exposure, beyond the property lines, for auto customers who have purchased physical damage coverage. auto physical damage coverage generally includes coverage for flood-related loss. we manage this additional exposure through inclusion of auto losses in our nationwide reinsurance program (which excludes new jersey and florida). new jersey auto losses are included in our new jersey reinsurance program.
•   designed a homeowners new business offering, allstate house and home, that provides options of coverage for roof damage including graduated coverage and pricing based on roof type and age. allstate house and home is currently available in 37 states.
hurricanes we consider the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to hurricanes generally to be major metropolitan centers in counties along the eastern and gulf coasts of the united states. usually, the average premium on a property policy near these coasts is greater than in other areas. however, average premiums are often not considered commensurate with the inherent risk of loss. in addition and as explained in note 14 of the consolidated financial statements, in various states allstate is subject to assessments from assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations providing insurance for wind related property losses.
we have addressed our risk of hurricane loss by, among other actions, purchasing reinsurance for specific states and on a countrywide basis for our personal lines property insurance in areas most exposed to hurricanes, limiting personal homeowners, landlord package policy and manufactured home new business writings in coastal areas in southern and eastern states, implementing tropical cyclone deductibles where appropriate, and not offering continuing coverage on certain policies in coastal counties in certain states. we continue to seek appropriate returns for the risks we write. this may require further actions, similar to those already taken, in geographies where we are not getting appropriate returns. however, we may maintain or opportunistically increase our presence in areas where we achieve adequate returns and do not materially increase our hurricane risk.
earthquakes we do not offer earthquake coverage in most states and actions taken to reduce our exposure from earthquake losses are complete. we purchased reinsurance in the state of kentucky and entered into arrangements in many states to make earthquake coverage available through non-proprietary insurers.
we retain approximately 30,000 pif with earthquake coverage, primarily in kentucky, due to regulatory and other reasons. we continue to have exposure to earthquake risk on certain policies that do not specifically exclude coverage for earthquake losses, including our auto policies, and to fires following earthquakes. allstate policyholders in the state of california are offered coverage through the cea, a privately-financed, publicly-managed state agency created to provide insurance coverage for earthquake damage. allstate is subject to assessments from the cea under certain circumstances as explained in note 14 of the consolidated financial statements. while north light writes property policies in california, which can include earthquake coverage, this coverage is 100% ceded via quota share reinsurance.
fires following earthquakes under a standard homeowners policy we cover fire losses, including those caused by an earthquake. actions taken related to our risk of loss from fires following earthquakes include restrictive underwriting guidelines in california for new business writings, purchasing reinsurance for kentucky personal lines property risks, and purchasing nationwide occurrence reinsurance, excluding florida and new jersey.
wildfires actions taken related to managing our risk of loss from wildfires include changing homeowners underwriting requirements in certain states and purchasing nationwide occurrence reinsurance. we also have inspection programs to identify homes that are susceptible to wildfires.
reinsurance a description of our current catastrophe reinsurance program appears in note 10 of the consolidated financial statements.

discontinued lines and coverages segment overview  the discontinued lines and coverages segment includes results from property-liability insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run-off. our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims is reported in this segment. we have assigned management of this segment to a designated group of professionals with expertise in claims handling, policy coverage interpretation, exposure identification and reinsurance collection. as part of its responsibilities, this group may at times be engaged in policy buybacks, settlements and reinsurance assumed and ceded commutations.

underwriting losses of $55 million in 2015 primarily related to our annual review using established industry and actuarial best practices resulting in a $39 million unfavorable reestimate of asbestos reserves, a $1 million unfavorable reestimate of environmental reserves and a $9 million unfavorable reestimate of other exposure reserves, partially offset by a $5 million decrease in allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance. the cost of administering claims settlements totaled $10 million for 2015, $10 million for 2014, and $13 million for 2013.
underwriting losses of $115 million in 2014 primarily related to our annual review using established industry and actuarial best practices resulting in an $87 million unfavorable reestimate of asbestos reserves, a $15 million unfavorable reestimate of environmental reserves and a $3 million increase in allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance, partially offset by a $3 million favorable reestimate of other exposure reserves.
underwriting losses of $143 million in 2013 related to a $74 million unfavorable reestimate of asbestos reserves, a $30 million unfavorable reestimate of environmental reserves and a $30 million unfavorable reestimate of other exposure reserves, primarily as a result of our annual review using established industry and actuarial best practices, partially offset by a $1 million decrease in our allowance for future uncollectable reinsurance.
see the property-liability claims and claims expense reserves section of the md&a for a more detailed discussion.
discontinued lines and coverages outlook
•   we may continue to experience asbestos and/or environmental losses in the future. these losses could be due to the potential adverse impact of new information relating to new and additional claims or the impact of resolving unsettled claims based on unanticipated events such as litigation or legislative, judicial and regulatory actions. environmental losses may also increase as the result of additional funding for environmental site cleanup. because of our annual review, we believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on available information, technology, laws and regulations.
•   we anticipate progress in the resolution of certain bankruptcies related to insureds with asbestos claims, reducing the industry's asbestos related claims exposures.
•   we continue to address challenges related to the concentration of insurance and reinsurance industry legacy claims into companies who specialize in the runoff of this business.

the average pre-tax investment yields for the years ended december 31 are presented in the following table. pre-tax yield is calculated as investment income, generally before investment expense (including dividend income in the case of equity securities) divided by the average of investment balances at the end of each quarter during the year. for the purposes of the pre-tax yield calculation, income for directly held real estate, timber and other consolidated investments is net of asset level operating expenses (direct expenses of the assets reported in investment expense). for investments carried at fair value, investment balances exclude unrealized capital gains and losses.

net investment income decreased 4.9% or $64 million to $1.24 billion in 2015 from $1.30 billion in 2014 after decreasing 5.4% in 2014 compared to 2013. the 2015 decrease was primarily due to lower limited partnership income, a decline in average investment balances and lower prepayment fee income and litigation proceeds, partially offset by higher taxable fixed income portfolio yields. the 2014 decrease was primarily due to lower fixed income yields and equity dividends. the decrease in fixed income yields was primarily due to reinvestment at yields lower than the overall portfolio yield.

property-liability claims and claims expense reserves property-liability underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of property-liability claims and claims expense reserves. for a description of our reserve process, see note 8 of the consolidated financial statements and for a further description of our reserving policies and the potential variability in our reserve estimates, see the application of critical accounting estimates section of the md&a. these reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including incurred but not reported ("ibnr") claims, as of the reporting date.
the facts and circumstances leading to our reestimates of reserves relate to revisions to the development factors used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid. reestimates occur because actual losses are likely different than those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates. as of december 31, 2015, the impact of a reserve reestimation corresponding to a one percent increase or decrease in net reserves would be a decrease or increase of approximately $117 million in net income applicable to common shareholders.
we believe the net loss reserves for allstate protection exposures are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws and regulations.

allstate brand prior year reserve reestimates were $38 million unfavorable in 2015, $171 million favorable in 2014 and $220 million favorable in 2013. in 2015, this was primarily due to severity development for bodily injury coverage for recent years that was more than expected and litigation settlements from older years. in 2014, this was primarily due to severity development that was better than expected. in 2013, this was primarily due to severity development that was better than expected and catastrophe reserve reestimates.
these trends are primarily responsible for revisions to loss development factors, as described above, used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid. because these trends cause actual losses to differ from those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates, reserves are revised as actuarial studies validate new trends based on the indications of updated development factor calculations.
the impact of these reestimates on the allstate brand underwriting income is shown in the table below.

discontinued lines and coverages  we conduct an annual review in the third quarter of each year to evaluate and establish asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines reserves. reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined. using established industry and actuarial best practices and assuming no change in the regulatory or economic environment, this detailed and comprehensive methodology determines reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure (e.g. claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non-products exposure) presented by policyholders.
reserve reestimates for the discontinued lines and coverages are shown in the table below.

reserve additions for asbestos in 2015 were primarily related to a settlement with a large insured and more reported claims than expected. reserve additions for asbestos in 2014 were primarily related to more reported claims than expected and increased severity including claims from certain large insurance programs. reserve additions for asbestos in 2013 were primarily related to a cedent's settlement with a bankrupt insured of asbestos claims in excess of a previously advised amount and loss trends from other claims.
reserve additions for environmental in 2014 were primarily related to greater reported loss activity than expected. reserve additions for environmental in 2013 were primarily related to an adverse court ruling for site-specific disputed coverage.

the survival ratio is calculated by taking our ending reserves divided by payments made during the year. this is a commonly used but extremely simplistic and imprecise approach to measuring the adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserve levels. many factors, such as mix of business, level of coverage provided and settlement procedures have significant impacts on the amount of environmental and asbestos claims and claims expense reserves, claim payments and the resultant ratio. as payments result in corresponding reserve reductions, survival ratios can be expected to vary over time.
in 2015 and 2014, the asbestos and environmental net 3-year survival ratio decreased due to increased claim payments.

property-liability reinsurance ceded  for allstate protection, we utilize reinsurance to reduce exposure to catastrophe risk and manage capital, and to support the required statutory surplus and the insurance financial strength ratings of certain subsidiaries such as castle key insurance company and allstate new jersey insurance company. we purchase significant reinsurance to manage our aggregate countrywide exposure to an acceptable level. the price and terms of reinsurance and the credit quality of the reinsurer are considered in the purchase process, along with whether the price can be appropriately reflected in the costs that are considered in setting future rates charged to policyholders. we also participate in various reinsurance mechanisms, including industry pools and facilities, which are backed by the financial resources of the property-liability insurance company market participants, and have historically purchased reinsurance to mitigate long-tail liability lines, including environmental, asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures. we retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded to reinsurers. the michigan catastrophic claim association provides indemnification for losses over a retention level and under the national flood insurance program the federal government pays all covered claims and certain qualifying claim expenses.

(2)   as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, mcca includes $29 million and $32 million of reinsurance recoverable on paid claims, respectively, and $4.61 billion and $4.39 billion of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid claims, respectively.
reinsurance recoverables include an estimate of the amount of property-liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves that are ceded under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, including incurred but not reported unpaid losses. we calculate our ceded reinsurance estimate based on the terms of each applicable reinsurance agreement, including an estimate of how ibnr losses will ultimately be ceded under the agreement. we also consider other limitations and coverage exclusions under our reinsurance agreements. accordingly, our estimate of reinsurance recoverables is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as our estimate of reserves for property-liability claims and claims expense. we believe the recoverables are appropriately established; however, as our underlying reserves continue to develop, the amount ultimately recoverable may vary from amounts currently recorded. we regularly evaluate the reinsurers and the respective amounts recoverable, and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed. the establishment of reinsurance recoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates. changes in estimates could result in additional changes to the consolidated statements of operations.
the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance primarily relates to discontinued lines and coverages reinsurance recoverables and was $80 million and $95 million as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the allowance for discontinued lines and coverages represents 11.9% and 12.9% of the related reinsurance recoverable balances as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the allowance is based upon our ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, and other relevant factors. in addition, in the ordinary course of business, we may become involved in coverage disputes with certain of our reinsurers which may ultimately result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against such reinsurers to determine the parties' rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements. we employ dedicated specialists to manage reinsurance collections and disputes. we also consider recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedents, and recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedents and reinsurers in seeking to maximize our reinsurance recoveries.
adverse developments in the insurance industry have led to a decline in the financial strength of some of our reinsurance carriers, causing amounts recoverable from them and future claims ceded to them to be considered a higher risk. there has also been consolidation activity in the industry, which causes reinsurance risk across the industry to be concentrated among fewer companies. in addition, some companies have segregated asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines exposures into
58
separate legal entities with dedicated capital. regulatory bodies in certain cases have supported these actions. we are unable to determine the impact, if any, that these developments will have on the collectability of reinsurance recoverables in the future.
for a detailed description of the mcca, pliga and lloyd's, see note 10 of the consolidated financial statements. as of december 31, 2015, other than the recoverable balances listed in the table above, no other amount due or estimated to be due from any single property-liability reinsurer was in excess of $21 million.

ceded property-liability claims and claims expense        $602              $1,393              $1,717
in 2015, ceded property-liability premiums earned decreased $24 million, primarily due to decreased reinsurance premium rates and a decrease in policies written for the national flood insurance program and the mcca. in 2014, ceded property-liability premiums earned decreased $39 million, primarily due to decreased reinsurance premium rates and acquiring additional reinsurance in the capital markets. mcca ceded premiums were $84 million, $99 million and $101 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
ceded property-liability claims and claims expense decreased in 2015 primarily due to lower reserve increases for the mcca and pliga programs. ceded property-liability claims and claims expense decreased in 2014 primarily due to lower amounts ceded to the national flood insurance program and lower reserve increases for the pliga program.
reserve increases in the pliga program in 2015 are attributable to limited personal injury protection coverage on policies written prior to 2004. reserve increases in the pliga program in 2014 are attributable to unlimited personal injury protection coverage on policies written prior to 1991. the ceded claims reflects increased longer term paid loss trends due to increased costs of medical care and increased longevity of claimants. new claims for this cohort of policies are unlikely and pending claims are expected to decline.
our claim reserve development experience is similar to the mcca with reported and pending claims increasing in recent years. moreover, the mcca has reported severity increasing with nearly 60% of reimbursements for attendant and residential care services. michigan's unique no-fault auto insurance law provides unlimited lifetime coverage for medical expenses resulting from vehicle accidents. the reserve increases in the mcca program are attributable to an increased recognition of longer term paid loss trends. the paid loss trends are rising due to increased costs in medical and attendant care and increased longevity of claimants. as a result of continuing to originate auto policies in michigan with unlimited personal injury protection coverage, we expect pending mcca covered losses to increase each year.

pending mcca claims differ from most personal lines insurance pending claims as other personal lines policies have coverage limits and incurred claims settle in shorter periods. claims are considered pending as long as payments are continuing pursuant to an outstanding mcca claim, which can be for a claimant's lifetime. claims that occurred more than 5 years ago and continue to be paid often include lifetime benefits. pending, new and closed claims for michigan personal injury protection exposures, including those covered and not covered by the mcca reinsurance, for the years ended december 31 are summarized in the following table.

as of december 31, 2015, approximately 1,250 of our pending claims have been reported to the mcca, of which approximately 65% represents claims that occurred more than 5 years ago. there are 68 allstate brand claims with reserves in excess of $15 million as of december 31, 2015 which comprise approximately 40% of the gross ending reserves in the table above. as a result, significant developments with a single claimant can result in volatility in prior year incurred claims.
we enter into certain intercompany insurance and reinsurance transactions for the property-liability operations in order to maintain underwriting control and manage insurance risk among various legal entities. these reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
catastrophe reinsurance our catastrophe reinsurance program is designed, utilizing our risk management methodology, to address our exposure to catastrophes nationwide. our program is designed to provide reinsurance protection for catastrophes resulting from multiple perils including hurricanes, windstorms, hail, tornados, fires following earthquakes, earthquakes and wildfires. these reinsurance agreements are part of our catastrophe management strategy, which is intended to provide our shareholders an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business, and to reduce variability of earnings, while providing protection to our customers.
we anticipate completing the placement of our 2016 catastrophe reinsurance program in the second quarter of 2016. we expect the program will be similar to our 2015 catastrophe reinsurance program. for further details of the existing 2015 program, see note 10 of the consolidated financial statements.

allstate financial segment overview and strategy  the allstate financial segment sells traditional, interest-sensitive and variable life insurance and voluntary accident and health insurance products. we serve our customers through allstate exclusive agencies and exclusive financial specialists, and workplace enrolling independent agents. we previously offered and continue to have in force fixed annuities such as deferred and immediate annuities, and institutional products consisting of funding agreements sold to unaffiliated trusts that use them to back medium-term notes. allstate exclusive agencies and exclusive financial specialists have a portfolio of non-proprietary products to sell, including mutual funds, fixed and variable annuities, disability insurance and long-term care insurance, to help meet customer needs.
allstate financial brings value to the allstate corporation in three principal ways: through improving the economics of the protection business through increased customer loyalty and deepened customer relationships based on cross selling allstate financial products to existing customers, bringing new customers to allstate, and profitable growth. allstate financial's strategy is focused on expanding allstate customer relationships, growing the number of products delivered to customers through allstate exclusive agencies and allstate benefits (our workplace distribution business), managing the run-off of our in-force annuity products while taking actions to improve returns, and emphasizing capital efficiency and shareholder returns.
the strategy for our life insurance business centers on the continuation of efforts to fully integrate the business into the allstate brand customer value proposition and modernizing our operating model. the life insurance product portfolio and sales process are being redesigned with a focus on clear and distinct positioning to meet the varied needs of allstate customers. our product positioning will provide solutions to help meet customer needs during various life stages ranging from basic mortality protection to more complex mortality and financial planning solutions. basic mortality protection solutions will be provided through less complex products, such as term and whole life insurance, sold through exclusive agents and licensed sales professionals to deepen customer relationships. more advanced mortality and financial planning solutions will be provided primarily through exclusive financial specialists with an emphasis on our more complex offerings, such as universal life insurance products. sales producer education and technology improvements are being made to ensure agencies have the tools and information needed to help customers meet their needs and build personal relationships as trusted advisors. additionally, tools will be made available to consumers to help them understand their needs and encourage interaction with their local agencies.
our employer relationships through allstate benefits also afford opportunities to offer allstate products to more customers and grow our business. allstate benefits is an industry leader in the voluntary benefits market, offering a broad range of products, including critical illness, accident, cancer, hospital indemnity, disability and universal life. allstate benefits differentiates itself by offering a broad product portfolio, flexible enrollment solutions and technology (including significant presence on private exchanges), and its strong national accounts team, as well as the well-recognized allstate brand. we are investing in new generation enrollment and administrative technology to improve our customer experience and modernize our operating model.
market trends for voluntary benefits are favorable as the market has nearly doubled in size since 2006, driven by the ability of voluntary benefits to fill gaps from employers seeking to contain rising health care costs, by providing lower cost benefits, and shifting costs to employees. allstate benefits has introduced new products and enhanced existing products to address these gaps by providing protection for catastrophic events such as a critical illness, accident or hospital stay. we are expanding our group life capabilities to broaden our product portfolio. originally a provider of voluntary benefits to small and mid-sized businesses, allstate benefits now provides benefit solutions to companies of all sizes and industries including the large account voluntary benefits marketplace.
allstate benefits is partnering with other allstate protection emerging businesses to expand our small business presence and enhance small business enrollment capabilities and technology. additionally, we are increasing allstate exclusive agency engagement to drive cross selling of voluntary benefits products, and developing opportunities for revenue growth through new product and fee income offerings. the allstate benefits strategy for growth also includes expansion in the national accounts market by increasing the number of sales, enrollment technology and account management personnel and expanding independent agent distribution in targeted geographic locations for increased new sales. allstate benefits new business written premiums increased 6.0% and 5.0% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. allstate benefits also expanded into the canadian market in 2015.
our in force deferred and immediate annuity business has been adversely impacted by the historically low interest rate environment. our immediate annuity business has also been impacted by medical advancements that have resulted in annuitants living longer than anticipated when many of these contracts were originated. we have initiated a mortality study for our structured settlement annuities with life contingencies, which is expected to be completed in 2016, to update our mortality assumptions concerning these trends. allstate financial focuses on the distinct risk and return profiles of the specific products outstanding when developing investment and liability management strategies. the level of legacy deferred annuities in force has been significantly reduced and the investment portfolio and annuity crediting rates are proactively managed to improve the profitability of the business while providing appropriate levels of liquidity. the investment portfolio supporting our immediate annuities is managed to ensure the assets match the characteristics of the liabilities and provide the long-term returns needed to support this business. we continue to increase investments in which we have ownership interests and a greater proportion of return is derived from idiosyncratic asset
61
or operating performance to more appropriately match the long-term nature of our immediate annuities. to transition our annuity business to a more efficient variable cost structure, we continue to assess additional utilization of outsourcing arrangements for the administration of the business.
allstate financial outlook
•   our growth initiatives continue to focus on increasing the number of customers served through our proprietary allstate agency and allstate benefits channels.
•   we expect lower investment spread on annuities due to the continuing managed reduction in contractholder funds, the low interest rate environment and investment maturity profile shortening actions.
•   allstate financial will continue to focus on improving long-term returns on our in-force annuity products and managing the impacts of historically low interest rates. we anticipate a continuation of our asset allocation strategy for long-term immediate annuities to have less reliance on investments whose returns come primarily from interest payments to investments in which we have ownership interests and a greater proportion of return is derived from idiosyncratic asset or operating performance, including performance-based investments. while we anticipate higher returns on these investments over time, the investment income can vary significantly between periods.
•   allstate financial has limitations on the amount of dividends allstate financial companies can pay without prior insurance department approval.
•   allstate financial continues to review strategic options to reduce exposure and improve returns of the spread-based businesses. as a result, we may take additional operational and financial actions that offer return improvement and risk reduction opportunities.

net income applicable to common shareholders was $663 million in 2015 compared to $631 million in 2014. the increase primarily relates to higher net realized capital gains and the loss on disposition related to the lbl sale in 2014, partially offset by lower net investment income and the reduction in business due to the sale of lbl on april 1, 2014. net income applicable to common shareholders in 2014 included an after-tax loss on disposition of lbl totaling $60 million. excluding the loss on disposition as well as the net income of the lbl business for first quarter 2014 of $28 million, net income applicable to common shareholders in 2015 was comparable to 2014, primarily due to higher net realized capital gains, higher life and annuity premiums and contract
62
charges, and lower interest credited to contractholder funds offsetting lower net investment income and higher life and annuity contract benefits.
net income applicable to common shareholders was $631 million in 2014 compared to $95 million in 2013. the increase primarily relates to lower loss on disposition charges related to the lbl sale, partially offset by the reduction in business due to the sale of lbl on april 1, 2014. net income applicable to common shareholders in 2014 and 2013 included an after-tax loss on disposition of lbl totaling $60 million and $521 million, respectively. excluding the loss on disposition as well as the net income of the lbl business for second through fourth quarter 2013 of $116 million, net income applicable to common shareholders increased $191 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to lower interest credited to contractholder funds, higher net realized capital gains, lower operating costs and expenses, lower amortization of dac, and higher life and annuity premiums and contract charges, partially offset by higher life and annuity contract benefits and lower net investment income.
analysis of revenues  total revenues decreased 2.8% or $123 million in 2015 compared to 2014. excluding results of the lbl business for first quarter 2014 of $211 million, total revenues increased 2.1% or $88 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to higher net realized capital gains and higher life and annuity premiums and contract charges, partially offset by lower net investment income. total revenues decreased 10.7% or $532 million in 2014 compared to 2013. excluding results of the lbl business for second through fourth quarter 2013 of $651 million, total revenues increased 2.8% or $119 million in 2014 compared to 2013, due to higher net realized capital gains and higher life and annuity premiums and contract charges, partially offset by lower net investment income.
life and annuity premiums and contract charges  premiums represent revenues generated from traditional life insurance, immediate annuities with life contingencies, and accident and health insurance products that have significant mortality or morbidity risk. contract charges are revenues generated from interest-sensitive and variable life insurance and fixed annuities for which deposits are classified as contractholder funds or separate account liabilities. contract charges are assessed against the contractholder account values for maintenance, administration, cost of insurance and surrender prior to contractually specified dates.
the following table summarizes life and annuity premiums and contract charges by product for the years ended december 31.

(1)   contract charges related to the cost of insurance totaled $550 million, $593 million and $725 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
total premiums and contract charges increased $1 million in 2015 compared to 2014. excluding results of the lbl business for first quarter 2014 of $85 million, premiums and contract charges increased $86 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to growth in allstate benefits accident and health insurance business as well as increased traditional life insurance renewal premiums. the growth at allstate benefits primarily relates to accident, critical illness and hospital indemnity products.
total premiums and contract charges decreased 8.3% or $195 million in 2014 compared to 2013. excluding results of the lbl business for second through fourth quarter 2013 of $254 million, premiums and contract charges increased $59 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to growth in allstate benefits accident and health insurance business and increased traditional life insurance premiums due to higher renewals and sales through allstate agencies, partially offset by lower premiums on immediate annuities with life contingencies due to discontinuing new sales january 1, 2014. the growth at allstate benefits primarily relates to accident and critical illness products and an increase in the number of employer groups.

contractholder funds represent interest-bearing liabilities arising from the sale of products such as interest-sensitive life insurance, fixed annuities and funding agreements. the balance of contractholder funds is equal to the cumulative deposits received and interest credited to the contractholder less cumulative contract benefits, surrenders, withdrawals, maturities and contract charges for mortality or administrative expenses.
the following table shows the changes in contractholder funds for the years ended december 31.

______________________________
(1)   the table above illustrates the changes in contractholder funds, which are presented gross of reinsurance recoverables on the consolidated statements of financial position. the table above is intended to supplement our discussion and analysis of revenues, which are presented net of reinsurance on the consolidated statements of operations. as a result, the net change in contractholder funds associated with products reinsured is reflected as a component of the other adjustments line.
contractholder funds decreased 5.5% and 7.3% in 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily due to the continued runoff of our deferred fixed annuity business that we stopped offering beginning january 1, 2014.
contractholder deposits decreased 9.8% in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to lower additional deposits on fixed annuities and lower deposits on interest-sensitive life insurance due to the lbl sale. contractholder deposits decreased 45.4% in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to no longer offering fixed annuity products beginning january 1, 2014, as well as lower deposits on interest-sensitive life insurance due to the lbl sale.
surrenders and partial withdrawals on deferred fixed annuities and interest-sensitive life insurance products decreased 43.8% to $1.28 billion in 2015 from $2.27 billion in 2014, primarily due to the continued runoff of our deferred annuity business and the lbl sale. additionally, 2014 had elevated surrenders on fixed annuities resulting from a large number of contracts reaching the 30-45 day period (typically at their 5 or 6 year anniversary) during which there is no surrender charge. surrenders and partial withdrawals on deferred fixed annuities and interest-sensitive life insurance products decreased 31.1% to $2.27 billion in 2014 from $3.30 billion in 2013, primarily due to the lbl sale. the surrender and partial withdrawal rate on deferred fixed annuities and interest-sensitive life insurance products, based on the beginning of year contractholder funds, was 7.1% in 2015 compared to 9.9% in 2014 and 10.2% in 2013.
maturities of and interest payments on institutional products included a $1.75 billion maturity in 2013. there are $85 million of institutional products outstanding as of december 31, 2015.

net investment income decreased 11.6% or $247 million to $1.88 billion in 2015 from $2.13 billion in 2014. excluding $126 million related to the lbl business for first quarter 2014, net investment income decreased $121 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to lower average investment balances, fixed income portfolio yields, and prepayment fee income and litigation proceeds, partially offset by higher limited partnership income. in 2015 we shortened the maturity profile of the fixed income securities in allstate financial to make the portfolio less sensitive to rising interest rates. the approximately $2 billion of proceeds from the sale of longer duration fixed income securities were invested in shorter duration fixed income securities and public equity securities that are expected to contribute lower net investment income and portfolio yields. over time, we will shift the majority of the proceeds to performance-based investments in which a greater proportion of return is derived from idiosyncratic asset or operating performance, to more appropriately match the long-term nature of our immediate annuity liabilities and improve long-term economic results. we anticipate higher long-term returns on these investments. while the dispositions generated net realized capital gains, investment income will be impacted by lower yields on the reinvested proceeds until repositioned to performance-based investments.
net investment income decreased 16.0% or $407 million to $2.13 billion in 2014 from $2.54 billion in 2013. excluding results of the lbl business for second through fourth quarter 2013 of $397 million, net investment income decreased $10 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to lower average investment balances, partially offset by higher limited partnership income.
the average pre-tax investment yields were 5.4% for 2015, 5.6% for 2014 and 5.1% for 2013.

analysis of costs and expenses  total costs and expenses decreased 3.3% or $114 million in 2015 compared to 2014. excluding results of the lbl business for first quarter 2014 of $168 million, total costs and expenses increased $54 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to higher life and annuity contract benefits, partially offset by lower interest credited to contractholder funds. total costs and expenses decreased 16.7% or $683 million in 2014 compared to 2013. excluding results of the lbl business for second through fourth quarter 2013 of $475 million, total costs and expenses decreased $208 million in 2014 compared to

2013, primarily due to lower interest credited to contractholder funds, lower operating costs and expenses and lower amortization of dac, partially offset by higher life and annuity contract benefits.
life and annuity contract benefits increased 2.2% or $38 million in 2015 compared to 2014. excluding results of the lbl business for first quarter 2014 of $65 million, life and annuity contract benefits increased $103 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to unfavorable life insurance mortality experience and growth at allstate benefits. our 2015 annual review of assumptions resulted in a $4 million increase in reserves primarily for secondary guarantees on interest-sensitive life insurance due to higher than anticipated retention on guaranteed interest-sensitive life business.
life and annuity contract benefits decreased 7.9% or $152 million in 2014 compared to 2013. excluding results of the lbl business for second through fourth quarter 2013 of $173 million, life and annuity contract benefits increased $21 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to worse mortality experience on life insurance and growth at allstate benefits. our 2014 annual review of assumptions resulted in an $11 million increase in reserves primarily for secondary guarantees on interest-sensitive life insurance due to increased projected exposure to secondary guarantees.
we analyze our mortality and morbidity results using the difference between premiums and contract charges earned for the cost of insurance and life and annuity contract benefits excluding the portion related to the implied interest on immediate annuities with life contingencies ("benefit spread"). this implied interest totaled $511 million, $521 million and $527 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

benefit spread increased 4.3% or $25 million in 2014 compared to 2013. excluding results of the lbl business for second through fourth quarter 2013 of $11 million, benefit spread increased $36 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to growth in allstate benefits accident and health insurance and higher premiums and cost of insurance contract charges on life insurance, partially offset by worse mortality experience on life insurance and immediate annuities.
interest credited to contractholder funds decreased 17.2% or $158 million in 2015 compared to 2014. excluding results of the lbl business for first quarter 2014 of $90 million, interest credited to contractholder funds decreased 8.2% or $68 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to lower average contractholder funds and lower interest crediting rates. interest credited to contractholder funds decreased 28.1% or $359 million in 2014 compared to 2013. excluding results of the lbl business for second through fourth quarter 2013 of $270 million, interest credited to contractholder funds decreased $89 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to lower average contractholder funds and lower interest crediting rates. valuation changes on derivatives embedded in equity-indexed annuity contracts that are not hedged increased interest credited to contractholder funds by $2 million in 2015 compared to $22 million in 2014 and $24 million in 2013.
in order to analyze the impact of net investment income and interest credited to contractholders on net income, we monitor the difference between net investment income and the sum of interest credited to contractholder funds and the implied interest on immediate annuities with life contingencies, which is included as a component of life and annuity contract benefits on the consolidated statements of operations ("investment spread").

investment spread before valuation changes on embedded derivatives that are not hedged decreased 13.9% or $99 million in 2015 compared to 2014. excluding results of the lbl business for first quarter 2014 of $46 million, investment spread before valuation changes on embedded derivatives that are not hedged decreased $53 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to lower net investment income, partially offset by lower credited interest. investment spread before valuation changes on embedded derivatives that are not hedged decreased 5.8% or $44 million in 2014 compared to 2013. excluding results of the lbl business for the second through fourth quarter of 2013 of $149 million, investment spread before valuation changes on embedded derivatives that are not hedged increased $105 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to higher limited partnership income, higher fixed income yields and lower crediting rates, partially offset by the continued managed reduction in our spread-based business in force.
to further analyze investment spreads, the following table summarizes the weighted average investment yield on assets supporting product liabilities and capital, interest crediting rates and investment spreads. for purposes of these calculations, investments, reserves and contractholder funds classified as held for sale were included for periods prior to april 1, 2014. investment spreads may vary significantly between periods due to the variability in investment income, particularly for immediate fixed annuities where the investment portfolio includes limited partnerships.

______________________________
(1)   the impact of realized capital gains and losses on amortization of dac is dependent upon the relationship between the assets that give rise to the gain or loss and the product liability supported by the assets. fluctuations result from changes in the impact of realized capital gains and losses on actual and expected gross profits.
amortization of dac increased 0.8% or $2 million in 2015 compared to 2014. excluding results of the lbl business for first quarter 2014 of $5 million, amortization of dac increased $7 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to amortization acceleration for changes in assumptions in 2015 compared to amortization deceleration in 2014.
amortization of dac decreased 20.7% or $68 million in 2014 compared to 2013. excluding results of the lbl business for second through fourth quarter 2013 of $1 million, amortization of dac decreased $67 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to amortization deceleration for changes in assumptions in 2014 compared to amortization acceleration in 2013, partially offset by higher amortization on accident and health insurance resulting from growth.
our annual comprehensive review of assumptions underlying estimated future gross profits for our interest-sensitive life, fixed annuities and other investment contracts covers assumptions for persistency, mortality, expenses, investment returns, including
68
capital gains and losses, interest crediting rates to policyholders, and the effect of any hedges in all product lines. in 2015, the review resulted in an acceleration of dac amortization (charge to income) of $1 million related to interest-sensitive life insurance.
in 2014, the review resulted in a deceleration of dac amortization (credit to income) of $8 million. amortization deceleration of $10 million related to interest-sensitive life insurance and was primarily due to a decrease in projected expenses, partially offset by increased projected mortality. amortization acceleration of $2 million related to fixed annuities and was primarily due to a decrease in projected gross profits.
in 2013, the review resulted in an acceleration of dac amortization of $23 million. amortization acceleration of $38 million related to interest-sensitive life insurance and was primarily due to an increase in projected mortality and expenses, partially offset by increased projected investment margins. amortization deceleration of $12 million related to fixed annuities and was primarily due to an increase in projected investment margins. amortization deceleration of $3 million related to variable life insurance.
the changes in dac for the years ended december 31 are detailed in the following table.

general and administrative expenses increased 3.5% or $11 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to increased expenses at allstate benefits relating to employee costs, reinsurance expense allowances paid to lbl for business reinsured to allstate life insurance company ("alic") after the sale, and a guaranty fund accrual release in the prior year period, partially offset by lower technology costs.

general and administrative expenses decreased 21.1% or $84 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to actions to improve strategic focus and modernize the operating model. this included the sale of lbl, exiting the master brokerage agency distribution channel, discontinuing sales of proprietary annuity products, and other rightsizing and profitability actions.
income tax expense included $17 million related to our adoption of new accounting guidance for investments in qualified affordable housing projects in first quarter 2015.
reinsurance ceded  in the normal course of business, we seek to limit aggregate and single exposure to losses on large risks by purchasing reinsurance. in addition, allstate financial has used reinsurance to effect the disposition of certain blocks of business. we retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded to reinsurers. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, 21% and 23%, respectively, of our face amount of life insurance in force was reinsured. additionally, we ceded substantially all of the risk associated with our variable annuity business.

investments overview and strategy  the return on our investment portfolios is an important component of our financial results. investment portfolios are held for the property-liability, allstate financial and corporate and other operations. while taking into consideration the investment portfolio in aggregate, the management of the underlying portfolios is significantly influenced by the nature of each respective business and its corresponding liability profile. for each operation, we identify a strategic asset allocation which considers both the nature of the liabilities and the risk and return characteristics of the various asset classes in which we invest. this allocation is informed by our long-term and market expectations, as well as other considerations such as risk appetite, portfolio diversification, duration, desired liquidity and capital. within appropriate ranges relative to strategic allocations, tactical allocations are made in consideration of prevailing and potential future market conditions. we manage risks that involve uncertainty related to interest rates, credit spreads, equity returns and currency exchange rates.
the property-liability portfolio emphasizes protection of principal and consistent income generation, within a total return framework. this approach has produced competitive returns over the long term and is designed to ensure financial strength and stability for paying claims, while maximizing economic value and surplus growth. products with lower liquidity needs, such as auto insurance and discontinued lines and coverages, and capital create capacity to invest in less liquid higher yielding fixed income securities and limited partnerships, as well as equity securities. products with higher liquidity needs, such as homeowners insurance, are invested primarily in high quality liquid fixed income securities.
the allstate financial portfolio is comprised of assets chosen to generate returns to support corresponding liabilities, within an asset-liability framework that targets an appropriate return on capital. for longer-term immediate annuity liabilities, we invest primarily in performance-based and other equity investments. for shorter-term annuity and life insurance liabilities, we invest primarily in interest-bearing investments, such as fixed income securities and commercial mortgage loans.
the corporate and other portfolio balances unique liquidity needs related to the overall corporate capital structure with the pursuit of returns.
within each segment, we utilize four high level strategies to manage risks and returns and to position our portfolio to take advantage of market opportunities while attempting to mitigate adverse effects. as strategies and market conditions evolve, the asset allocation may change or assets may move between strategies.
market-based core strategy seeks to deliver predictive earnings aligned to business needs through investments primarily in public fixed income and equity. private fixed income assets, such as commercial mortgages, bank loans and privately placed debt are also included in this category. as of december 31, 2015, 83% of the portfolio follows this strategy with 86% in fixed income securities and mortgage loans and 7% in equity securities, including $1 billion of equity securities that we may not hold for a period of time sufficient to recover unrealized losses.
market-based active strategy seeks to outperform within the public markets through tactical positioning and by taking advantage of short-term opportunities. this strategy may generate results that meaningfully deviate from those achieved by market indices, both favorably and unfavorably. the portfolio primarily includes public fixed income and equity. as of december 31, 2015, 10% of the portfolio follows this strategy with 82% in fixed income securities and 9% in equity securities, including $728 million of equity securities that we may not hold for a period of time sufficient to recover unrealized losses.
performance-based long-term ("pblt") strategy seeks to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns over a longer horizon. the achieved return is a function of both general market conditions and the performance of the underlying assets or businesses. the portfolio, which primarily includes private equity, real estate, infrastructure, timber and agriculture-related assets, is diversified across a number of characteristics, including managers or partners, vintage years, strategies, geographies (including international) and industry sectors or property types. these investments are generally illiquid in nature, often require specialized expertise, typically involve a third party manager, and may offer the potential to add value through transformation at the company or property level. as of december 31, 2015, 7% of the portfolio follows this strategy with 89% in limited partnership interests.
performance-based opportunistic strategy seeks to earn attractive returns by making investments that involve asset dislocations or special situations, often in private markets. the portfolio primarily includes distressed and event driven assets primarily in fixed income and equity.

investments outlook the fomc raised the federal funds target rate in december 2015 for the first time since december 2008, and in january 2016, the fomc left the rate unchanged. we anticipate that interest rates will continue to increase but remain below historic averages for an extended period of time and that financial markets will continue to have periods of high volatility and less liquidity. invested assets and income are expected to decline in line with reductions in contractholder funds for the allstate financial segment. additionally, investment income will decline as a result of maturity profile shortening in 2015 to reduce the risk of rising interest rates in allstate financial and as we continue to invest and reinvest investment proceeds at market yields that are below the current portfolio yield. we plan to focus on the following priorities:
•   expanding our capabilities in performance-based investing to increase portfolio returns and capital creation and taking advantage of increased market volatility through higher allocation to market-based active strategies.
•   continue to shift the portfolio mix to include more performance-based investments, primarily private equity, real estate, infrastructure, timber and agriculture-related assets. a greater proportion of the return on these investments is derived from idiosyncratic asset or operating performance. while we anticipate higher returns on these investments over time, the investment income can vary significantly between periods.
•   investing for the specific needs and characteristics of allstate's businesses, including its corresponding liability profile.

investments totaled $77.76 billion as of december 31, 2015, decreasing from $81.11 billion as of december 31, 2014, primarily due to common share repurchases, a decline in fixed income valuations resulting from widening credit spreads and an increase in risk-free interest rates, net reductions in contractholder funds, dividends paid to shareholders and a decline in equity valuations.
the property-liability investment portfolio totaled $38.48 billion as of december 31, 2015, decreasing from $39.08 billion as of december 31, 2014, primarily due to dividends paid by allstate insurance company ("aic") to the allstate corporation (the "corporation") and a decline in fixed income and equity valuations, partially offset by positive operating cash flows.
the allstate financial investment portfolio totaled $36.79 billion as of december 31, 2015, decreasing from $38.81 billion as of december 31, 2014, primarily due to a decline in fixed income valuations, net reductions in contractholder funds and dividends paid by alic to aic.

during 2015, strategic actions focused on optimizing portfolio yield, return and risk in the low interest rate environment. in the property-liability portfolio, we maintained the shorter maturity profile of our fixed income securities established in 2013. in the allstate financial portfolio, we reduced the portfolio's maturity profile and invested proceeds from the sale of longer duration fixed income securities in shorter duration fixed income securities and public equity securities. these actions have reduced our exposure to rising interest rates. we continue increasing our performance-based investments in both the property-liability and allstate financial portfolios, consistent with our ongoing strategy to have a greater proportion of ownership of assets and equity investments. in allstate financial's portfolio, performance-based and other equity investments will continue to be allocated primarily to the longer-term immediate annuity liabilities to improve returns on those products. shorter-term annuity and life insurance liabilities will continue to be invested primarily in interest-bearing investments, such as fixed income securities and commercial mortgage loans.

as of december 31, 2015, 85.1% of the consolidated fixed income securities portfolio was rated investment grade, which is defined as a security having a rating of aaa, aa, a or baa from moody's, a rating of aaa, aa, a or bbb from s&p, fitch, dominion, kroll or realpoint, a rating of aaa, aa, a or bbb from a.m. best, or a comparable internal rating if an externally provided rating is not available. credit ratings below these designations are considered low credit quality or below investment grade, which includes high yield bonds. fixed income securities are rated by third party credit rating agencies, the national association of insurance commissioners ("naic"), and/or are internally rated. market prices for certain securities may have credit spreads which imply higher or lower credit quality than the current third party rating. our initial investment decisions and ongoing monitoring procedures for fixed income securities are based on a thorough due diligence process which includes, but is not limited to, an assessment of the credit quality, sector, structure, and liquidity risks of each issue.

(1)   the nature of the activities supporting revenue bonds is diversified and includes transportation, health care, industrial development, housing, higher education, utilities, recreation/convention centers and other activities.
our practice for acquiring and monitoring municipal bonds is predominantly based on the underlying credit quality of the primary obligor. we currently rely on the primary obligor to pay all contractual cash flows and are not relying on bond insurers for payments. as a result of downgrades in the insurers' credit ratings, the ratings of the insured municipal bonds generally reflect the underlying ratings of the primary obligor. as of december 31, 2015, 99.6% of our insured municipal bond portfolio is rated investment grade.
corporate bonds, including publicly traded and privately placed, totaled $41.83 billion as of december 31, 2015, with an unrealized net capital gain of $153 million. privately placed securities primarily consist of corporate issued senior debt securities that are directly negotiated with the borrower or are in unregistered form.
74
our $11.43 billion portfolio of privately placed securities is diversified by issuer, industry sector and country. the portfolio is made up of 459 issuers. privately placed corporate obligations may contain structural security features such as financial covenants and call protections that provide investors greater protection against credit deterioration, reinvestment risk or fluctuations in interest rates than those typically found in publicly registered debt securities. additionally, investments in these securities are made after due diligence of the issuer, typically including discussions with senior management and on-site visits to company facilities. ongoing monitoring includes direct periodic dialog with senior management of the issuer and continuous monitoring of operating performance and financial position. every issue not rated by an independent rating agency is internally rated with a formal rating affirmation at least once a year.
our corporate bonds portfolio includes $7.52 billion of below investment grade bonds, $2.75 billion of which are privately placed. these securities are diversified by issuer and industry sector. the below investment grade corporate bonds portfolio is made up of 291 issuers. we employ fundamental analyses of issuers and sectors along with macro and asset class views to identify investment opportunities. this results in a portfolio with broad exposure to the high yield market, yet with an emphasis on idiosyncratic positions reflective of our views of market conditions and opportunities.
foreign government securities totaled $1.03 billion as of december 31, 2015, with 99.4% rated investment grade and an unrealized net capital gain of $50 million. of these securities, 59.8% are in canadian governmental and provincial securities (53.8% of which are held by our canadian companies), 22.3% are backed by the u.s. government and the remaining 17.9% are highly diversified in other foreign governments.
abs, rmbs and cmbs are structured securities that are primarily collateralized by consumer or corporate borrowings and residential and commercial real estate loans. the cash flows from the underlying collateral paid to the securitization trust are generally applied in a pre-determined order and are designed so that each security issued by the trust, typically referred to as a "class", qualifies for a specific original rating. for example, the "senior" portion or "top" of the capital structure, or rating class, which would originally qualify for a rating of aaa typically has priority in receiving principal repayments on the underlying collateral and retains this priority until the class is paid in full. in a sequential structure, underlying collateral principal repayments are directed to the most senior rated aaa class in the structure until paid in full, after which principal repayments are directed to the next most senior aaa class in the structure until it is paid in full. senior aaa classes generally share any losses from the underlying collateral on a pro-rata basis after losses are absorbed by classes with lower original ratings. the payment priority and class subordination included in these securities serves as credit enhancement for holders of the senior or top portions of the structures. these securities continue to retain the payment priority features that existed at the origination of the securitization trust. other forms of credit enhancement may include structural features embedded in the securitization trust, such as overcollateralization, excess spread and bond insurance. the underlying collateral may contain fixed interest rates, variable interest rates (such as adjustable rate mortgages), or both fixed and variable rate features.
abs, including cdo and consumer and other abs, totaled $2.33 billion as of december 31, 2015, with 96.2% rated investment grade and an unrealized net capital loss of $32 million. credit risk is managed by monitoring the performance of the underlying collateral. many of the securities in the abs portfolio have credit enhancement with features such as overcollateralization, subordinated structures, reserve funds, guarantees and/or insurance.
cdo totaled $777 million as of december 31, 2015, with 91.2% rated investment grade and an unrealized net capital loss of $35 million. cdo consist of obligations collateralized by cash flow cdo, which are structures collateralized primarily by below investment grade senior secured corporate loans.
consumer and other abs totaled $1.55 billion as of december 31, 2015, with 98.7% rated investment grade. consumer and other abs consists of $819 million of consumer auto, $497 million of credit card and $234 million of other abs with unrealized net capital losses of $3 million, unrealized net capital losses of $1 million and unrealized net capital gains of $7 million, respectively.
rmbs totaled $947 million as of december 31, 2015, with 28.2% rated investment grade and an unrealized net capital gain of $90 million. the rmbs portfolio is subject to interest rate risk, but unlike other fixed income securities, is additionally subject to prepayment risk from the underlying residential mortgage loans. rmbs consists of a u.s. agency portfolio having collateral issued or guaranteed by u.s. government agencies and a non-agency portfolio consisting of securities collateralized by prime, alt-a and subprime loans. the non-agency portfolio totaled $748 million as of december 31, 2015, with 9.1% rated investment grade and an unrealized net capital gain of $83 million.
cmbs totaled $466 million as of december 31, 2015, with 50.4% rated investment grade and an unrealized net capital gain of $28 million. the cmbs portfolio is subject to credit risk and has a sequential paydown structure. of the cmbs investments, 95.7% are traditional conduit transactions collateralized by commercial mortgage loans, broadly diversified across property types and geographical area. the remainder consists of non-traditional cmbs such as privately placed, small balance transactions.
75
equity securities primarily include common stocks, exchange traded and mutual funds, non-redeemable preferred stocks and real estate investment trust equity investments. the equity securities portfolio was $5.08 billion as of december 31, 2015, with an unrealized net capital gain of $276 million. as of december 31, 2015, equity securities that we may not hold for a period of time sufficient to recover unrealized losses totaled $1.7 billion, which is discussed further in the realized capital gains and losses section.
mortgage loans, which are primarily held in the allstate financial portfolio, totaled $4.34 billion as of december 31, 2015 and primarily comprise loans secured by first mortgages on developed commercial real estate. key considerations used to manage our exposure include property type and geographic diversification. for further detail on our mortgage loan portfolio, see note 5 of the consolidated financial statements.
limited partnership interests include interests in private equity funds and co-investments, real estate funds and joint ventures, and other funds. the following table presents carrying value and other information about our limited partnership interests as of december 31, 2015.

other investments primarily comprise $1.57 billion of bank loans, $905 million of policy loans, $422 million of agent loans (loans issued to exclusive allstate agents) and $53 million of derivatives as of december 31, 2015. for further detail on our use of derivatives, see note 7 of the consolidated financial statements.
unrealized net capital gains totaled $1.03 billion as of december 31, 2015 compared to $3.17 billion as of december 31, 2014. the decrease for fixed income securities was primarily due to wider credit spreads, an increase in risk-free interest rates and the realization of unrealized net capital gains through sales. the decrease for equity securities was primarily due to negative equity market performance and the realization of unrealized net capital gains through sales, partially offset by the realization of unrealized net capital losses through write-downs.

we have a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate each fixed income and equity security that may be other-than-temporarily impaired. the process includes a quarterly review of all securities to identify instances where the fair value of a security compared to its amortized cost (for fixed income securities) or cost (for equity securities) is below established thresholds. the process also includes the monitoring of other impairment indicators such as ratings, ratings downgrades and payment defaults. the securities identified, in addition to other securities for which we may have a concern, are evaluated for potential other-than-temporary impairment using all reasonably available information relevant to the collectability or recovery of the security. inherent in our evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment for these fixed income and equity securities are assumptions and estimates about the financial condition and future earnings potential of the issue or issuer. some of the factors that may be considered in evaluating whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary are: 1) the financial condition, near-

term and long-term prospects of the issue or issuer, including relevant industry specific market conditions and trends, geographic location and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices; 2) the specific reasons that a security is in an unrealized loss position, including overall market conditions which could affect liquidity; and 3) the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost or cost. all investments in an unrealized loss position as of december 31, 2015 were included in our portfolio monitoring process for determining whether declines in value were other than temporary.
the unrealized net capital gain for the fixed income portfolio totaled $747 million, comprised of $1.71 billion of gross unrealized gains and $960 million of gross unrealized losses as of december 31, 2015. this is compared to an unrealized net capital gain for the fixed income portfolio totaling $2.77 billion, comprised of $3.08 billion of gross unrealized gains and $314 million of gross unrealized losses as of december 31, 2014.
gross unrealized gains and losses on fixed income securities by type and sector as of december 31, 2015 are provided in the following table.

the consumer goods, utilities, energy and capital goods sectors comprise 29%, 12%, 10% and 10%, respectively, of the carrying value of our corporate fixed income securities portfolio as of december 31, 2015. the energy, consumer goods, basic industry and utilities sectors had the highest concentration of gross unrealized losses in our corporate fixed income securities portfolio as of december 31, 2015. in general, the gross unrealized losses are related to widening credit spreads or increasing risk-free interest rates since the time of initial purchase.
global oil prices have declined significantly since september 30, 2014 and natural gas and other commodity values have also declined significantly in 2015. among commodity exposed companies, those in the metal and mining sectors have experienced the largest decline in values of their debt. in the fixed income and equity securities tables above and below, oil and natural gas exposure is reflected within the energy sector and metals and mining exposure is reflected within the basic industry sector. within these sectors, we continue to monitor the impact to our investment portfolio for those companies that may be adversely affected, both directly and indirectly. if oil, natural gas and commodity prices remain at depressed levels for an extended period or decline further, certain issuers and investments may come under duress and may result in an increase in other-than-temporary impairments.
corporate fixed income and equity securities with gross unrealized losses that have direct exposure to the energy sector, have an aggregate carrying value of $3.15 billion and gross unrealized losses of $377 million as of december 31, 2015. 83% of the corporate fixed income securities with direct exposure to the energy sector were investment grade as of december 31, 2015. of the remaining below investment grade fixed income securities with gross unrealized losses that have a direct exposure to the energy sector, $35 million had been in an unrealized loss position for twelve or more consecutive months as of december 31, 2015. additionally, private equity limited partnership interests with exposure to energy totaled approximately $350 million as of december 31, 2015.

corporate fixed income and equity securities with gross unrealized losses that have direct exposure to the metals and mining sectors, have an aggregate carrying value of $468 million and gross unrealized losses of $81 million as of december 31, 2015. approximately 55% of the $437 million of corporate fixed income securities with direct exposure to the metals and mining sectors were investment grade as of december 31, 2015.

net investment income decreased 8.8% or $303 million in 2015 compared to 2014, after decreasing 12.3% or $484 million in 2014 compared to 2013. the 2015 decrease was primarily due to lower average investment balances including the sale of lbl on april 1, 2014, lower limited partnership income, lower yields due to maturity profile shortening in the allstate financial portfolio, and lower prepayment fee income and litigation proceeds, partially offset by an increased allocation to high yield investments and lower investment expenses. net investment income in 2015 includes $65 million related to prepayment fee income and litigation proceeds compared to $114 million in 2014. these items may vary significantly from period to period and may not recur. the 2014 decrease was primarily due to lower average investment balances relating to the sale of lbl on april 1, 2014, lower fixed income yields and equity dividends, partially offset by higher limited partnership income.

impairment write-downs            $(195   )          $(32   )          $(72   )
impairment write-downs on fixed income securities in 2015 were primarily driven by corporate fixed income securities impacted by issuer specific circumstances including exposure to oil and natural gas, defaulted special assessment municipal bonds, and collateralized loan obligations that experienced deterioration in expected cash flows. equity securities were written down primarily due to the length of time and extent to which fair value was below cost, considering our assessment of the financial condition and near-term and long-term prospects of the issuer, including relevant industry conditions and trends. limited partnership write-downs primarily related to two investments that have been impacted by the decline in natural gas prices. impairment write-downs in the above table include $97 million and $18 million of investments with exposure to the energy sector and metals and mining exposure in the basic industry sector, respectively.
impairment write-downs on fixed income securities in 2014 were primarily driven by collateralized loan obligations that experienced deterioration in expected cash flows and municipal and corporate fixed income securities impacted by issuer specific circumstances. limited partnership write-downs primarily related to cost method limited partnerships that experienced declines in portfolio valuations deemed to be other than temporary. equity securities were written down primarily due to the length of time and extent to which fair value was below cost, considering our assessment of the financial condition and near-term and long-term prospects of the issuer, including relevant industry conditions and trends. the valuation allowance on mortgage loans as of december 31, 2014 decreased compared to december 31, 2013 primarily due to reversals related to impaired loan payoffs.
impairment write-downs on fixed income securities in 2013 were primarily driven by cmbs that experienced deterioration in expected cash flows and municipal bonds impacted by issuer specific circumstances. limited partnership write-downs primarily related to cost method limited partnerships that experienced declines in portfolio valuations deemed to be other than temporary. equity securities were written down primarily due to the length of time and extent to which fair value was below cost, considering our assessment of the financial condition and near-term and long-term prospects of the issuer, including relevant industry conditions and trends. the valuation allowance on mortgage loans as of december 31, 2013 decreased compared to december 31, 2012 primarily due to reversals related to loans no longer deemed impaired.
change in intent write-downs totaled $221 million, $213 million and $143 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the change in intent write-downs in 2015 reflect market volatility and our preference to maintain flexibility to reposition the portfolio, as well as a higher allocation to our market-based active strategy. change in intent losses are primarily related to equity securities that we may not hold for a period of time sufficient to recover unrealized losses. as of december 31, 2015, these holdings totaled $1.7 billion and we recognized change in intent write-downs of $215 million in 2015. unrealized gains reflect certain of our previously written-down equity securities which recovered in value. the change in intent write-downs in 2014 and 2013 were primarily related to the repositioning and ongoing portfolio management of our equity securities. for certain equity securities managed by third parties, we do not retain decision making authority as it pertains to selling securities that are in an unrealized loss position and therefore we recognize any unrealized loss at the end of the period through a charge to earnings. as of december 31, 2015, these holdings totaled $47 million and we recognized change in intent write-downs of $6 million in 2015.
81
sales and other generated $470 million, $975 million and $819 million of net realized capital gains in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. sales and other in 2015 included sales of longer duration fixed income securities in connection with the maturity profile shortening in allstate financial and equity securities in connection with ongoing portfolio management, as well as losses from valuation changes in public securities held in certain limited partnerships. sales and other in 2014 primarily related to equity and fixed income securities in connection with ongoing portfolio management. sales and other in 2013 primarily related to equity securities in connection with portfolio repositioning and ongoing portfolio management and municipal and corporate fixed income securities in conjunction with reducing our exposure to interest rate risk in the property-liability portfolio.
valuation and settlements of derivative instruments generated net realized capital losses of $24 million, $36 million and $10 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. the net realized capital losses in 2015 primarily comprised losses on foreign currency contracts due to the weakening of the canadian dollar. the net realized capital losses in 2014 primarily comprised losses on equity futures used for risk management due to increases in equity indices and losses on foreign currency contracts due to the weakening of the canadian dollar. the net realized capital losses in 2013 primarily comprised losses on equity futures used for risk management due to increases in equity indices and losses on credit default swaps due to the tightening of credit spreads on the underlying credit names.
performance-based long-term investments primarily include private equity, real estate, infrastructure, timber and agriculture-related assets and are materially reflected through our limited partnership investments.

(1)   other limited partnership interests are located in the market-based core investing strategy and are not included in the performance-based long-term table above. investment income was $(10) million and $12 million and realized capital gains and losses were $(43) million and zero in 2015 and 2014, respectively, for these limited partnership interests.
(2)   asset level operating expenses are netted against income for directly held real estate, timber and other consolidated investments for purposes of the pre-tax yield calculations.
pblt investments produced investment income of $589 million in 2015 compared to $625 million in 2014. the decrease primarily related to lower income on real estate investments due to modest returns compared to significant returns in 2014. partially offsetting the decrease was higher income on private equity investments due to net returns from the diversified portfolio along with strong distributions as acquirer access to financing and an active global merger and acquisition market facilitated the sales of underlying investments, which more than offset a decline in valuations of investments with exposure to the energy sector.
realized capital losses on pblt investments in 2015 were $46 million compared to realized capital gains of $20 million in 2014. included in 2015 were impairment write-downs primarily related to two energy related investments that have been impacted by a decline in natural gas prices.
economic conditions and equity market performance are reflected in pblt investment results and we continue to expect this income to vary significantly between periods.

market risk market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices or currency exchange rates. adverse changes to these rates and prices may occur due to changes in fiscal policy, the economic climate, the liquidity of a market or market segment, insolvency or financial distress of key market makers or participants or changes in market perceptions of credit worthiness and/or risk tolerance. our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates, credit spreads and equity prices.
the active management of market risk is integral to our results of operations. we may use the following approaches to manage exposure to market risk within defined tolerance ranges: 1) rebalancing existing asset or liability portfolios, 2) changing the type of investments purchased in the future and 3) using derivative instruments to modify the market risk characteristics of existing assets and liabilities or assets expected to be purchased. for a more detailed discussion of our use of derivative financial instruments, see note 7 of the consolidated financial statements.
overview  in formulating and implementing guidelines for investing funds, we seek to earn returns that enhance our ability to offer competitive rates and prices to customers while contributing to attractive and stable profits and long-term capital growth. accordingly, our investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each business.
investment policies define the overall framework for managing market and other investment risks, including accountability and controls over risk management activities. subsidiaries that conduct investment activities follow policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors. these investment policies specify the investment limits and strategies that are appropriate given the liquidity, surplus, product profile and regulatory requirements of the subsidiary. executive oversight of investment activities is conducted primarily through subsidiaries' boards of directors and investment committees. for allstate financial, its asset-liability management ("alm") policies further define the overall framework for managing market and investment risks. alm focuses on strategies to enhance yields, mitigate market risks and optimize capital to improve profitability and returns for allstate financial while factoring in future expected cash requirements to repay liabilities. allstate financial alm activities follow asset-liability policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors. these alm policies specify limits, ranges and/or targets for investments that best meet allstate financial's business objectives in light of its product liabilities.
we use quantitative and qualitative market-based approaches to measure, monitor and manage market risk. we evaluate our exposure to market risk through the use of multiple measures including but not limited to duration, value-at-risk, scenario analysis and sensitivity analysis. duration measures the price sensitivity of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. for example, if interest rates increase 100 basis points, the fair value of an asset with a duration of 5 is expected to decrease in value by 5%. value-at-risk is a statistical estimate of the probability that the change in fair value of a portfolio will exceed a certain amount over a given time horizon. scenario analysis estimates the potential changes in the fair value of a portfolio that could occur under different hypothetical market conditions defined by changes to multiple market risk factors: interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices or currency exchange rates. sensitivity analysis estimates the potential changes in the fair value of a portfolio that could occur under different hypothetical shocks to a market risk factor. in general, we establish investment portfolio asset allocation and market risk limits for the property-liability and allstate financial businesses based upon a combination of duration, value-at-risk, scenario analysis and sensitivity analysis. the asset allocation limits place restrictions on the total funds that may be invested within an asset class. comprehensive day-to-day management of market risk within defined tolerance ranges occurs as portfolio managers buy and sell within their respective markets based upon the acceptable boundaries established by investment policies. for allstate financial, this day-to-day management is integrated with and informed by the activities of the alm organization. this integration is intended to result in a prudent, methodical and effective adjudication of market risk and return, conditioned by the unique demands and dynamics of allstate financial's product liabilities and supported by the continuous application of advanced risk technology and analytics.
although we apply a similar overall philosophy to market risk, the underlying business frameworks and the accounting and regulatory environments differ considerably between the property-liability and allstate financial businesses affecting investment decisions and risk parameters.
interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in interest rates relative to the characteristics of our interest bearing assets and liabilities. this risk arises from many of our primary activities, as we invest substantial funds in interest-sensitive assets and issue interest-sensitive liabilities. interest rate risk includes risks related to changes in u.s. treasury yields and other key risk-free reference yields.
we manage the interest rate risk in our assets relative to the interest rate risk in our liabilities and our assessment of overall economic and capital risk. one of the measures used to quantify this exposure is duration. the difference in the duration of our assets relative to our liabilities is our duration gap. to calculate the duration gap between assets and liabilities, we project asset and liability cash flows and calculate their net present value using a risk-free market interest rate adjusted for credit quality, sector attributes, liquidity and other specific risks. duration is calculated by revaluing these cash flows at alternative interest rates and determining the percentage change in aggregate fair value. the cash flows used in this calculation include the expected maturity
83
and repricing characteristics of our derivative financial instruments, all other financial instruments, and certain other items including unearned premiums, property-liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves, annuity liabilities and other interest-sensitive liabilities. the projections include assumptions (based upon historical market experience and our experience) that reflect the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment, lapse, leverage and/or option features of instruments, where applicable. the preceding assumptions relate primarily to callable municipal and corporate bonds, fixed rate single and flexible premium deferred annuities, mortgage-backed securities and municipal housing bonds. additionally, the calculations include assumptions regarding the renewal of property-liability policies.
as of december 31, 2015, the difference between our asset and liability duration was a (1.25) gap compared to a (1.26) gap as of december 31, 2014. a negative duration gap indicates that the fair value of our liabilities is more sensitive to interest rate movements than the fair value of our assets, while a positive duration gap indicates that the fair value of our assets is more sensitive to interest rate movements than the fair value of our liabilities. the property-liability segment generally maintains a positive duration gap between its assets and liabilities due to the relatively short duration of auto and homeowners claims, which are its primary liabilities. the allstate financial segment may have a positive or negative duration gap, as the duration of its assets and liabilities vary with its product mix and investing activity. as of december 31, 2015, property-liability had a positive duration gap while allstate financial had a negative duration gap.
in the management of investments supporting the property-liability business, we adhere to an objective of emphasizing safety of principal and consistency of income within a total return framework. this approach is designed to ensure our financial strength and stability for paying claims, while maximizing economic value and surplus growth.
for the allstate financial business, we seek to invest premiums, contract charges and deposits to generate future cash flows that will fund future claims, benefits and expenses, and that will earn stable returns across a wide variety of interest rate and economic scenarios. to achieve this objective and limit interest rate risk for allstate financial, we adhere to a philosophy of managing the duration of assets and related liabilities within predetermined tolerance levels. this philosophy is executed using duration targets for fixed income investments and may also include interest rate swaps, futures, forwards, caps, floors and swaptions to reduce the interest rate risk resulting from mismatches between existing assets and liabilities, and financial futures and other derivative instruments to hedge the interest rate risk of anticipated purchases and sales of investments.
based upon the information and assumptions used in the duration calculation, and interest rates in effect as of december 31, 2015, we estimate that a 100 basis point immediate, parallel increase in interest rates ("rate shock") would increase the net fair value of the assets and liabilities by $963 million, compared to an increase of $991 million as of december 31, 2014, reflecting year to year changes in duration and the amount of assets and liabilities. the selection of a 100 basis point immediate, parallel change in interest rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event. the estimate excludes the traditional and interest-sensitive life insurance products that are not considered financial instruments and the $9.86 billion of assets supporting them and the associated liabilities. the $9.86 billion of assets excluded from the calculation decreased from $9.91 billion as of december 31, 2014. based on assumptions described above, in the event of a 100 basis point immediate increase in interest rates, the assets supporting life insurance products would decrease in value by $558 million compared to a decrease of $583 million as of december 31, 2014.
to the extent that conditions differ from the assumptions we used in these calculations, duration and rate shock measures could be significantly impacted. additionally, our calculations assume that the current relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates (the term structure of interest rates) will remain constant over time. as a result, these calculations may not fully capture the effect of non-parallel changes in the term structure of interest rates and/or large changes in interest rates.
credit spread risk is the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in credit spreads ("spreads"). credit spread is the additional yield on fixed income securities and loans above the risk-free rate (typically referenced as the yield on u.s. treasury securities) that market participants require to compensate them for assuming credit, liquidity and/or prepayment risks. the magnitude of the spread will depend on the likelihood that a particular issuer will default ("credit risk"). this risk arises from many of our primary activities, as we invest substantial funds in spread-sensitive fixed income assets.
we manage the spread risk in our assets. one of the measures used to quantify this exposure is spread duration. spread duration measures the price sensitivity of the assets to changes in spreads. for example, if spreads increase 100 basis points, the fair value of an asset exhibiting a spread duration of 5 is expected to decrease in value by 5%.
spread duration is calculated similarly to interest rate duration. as of december 31, 2015, the spread duration of property-liability assets was 3.38, compared to 3.24 as of december 31, 2014, and the spread duration of allstate financial assets was 4.91, compared to 5.81 as of december 31, 2014. based upon the information and assumptions we use in this spread duration calculation, and spreads in effect as of december 31, 2015, we estimate that a 100 basis point immediate, parallel increase in spreads across all asset classes, industry sectors and credit ratings ("spread shock") would decrease the net fair value of the assets by $2.52 billion compared to $2.91 billion as of december 31, 2014. reflected in the duration calculation are the effects of our tactical actions that
84
use credit default swaps to manage spread risk. the selection of a 100 basis point immediate parallel change in spreads should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event.
equity price risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in the general levels of the equity markets. as of december 31, 2015, we held $4.98 billion in common stocks and exchange traded and mutual funds and $4.98 billion in other securities with equity risk (including primarily limited partnership interests and non-redeemable preferred securities), compared to $3.99 billion and $4.64 billion, respectively, as of december 31, 2014. 68.3% of the common stocks and exchange traded and mutual funds and 53.4% of the other securities with equity risk are in property-liability as of december 31, 2015, compared to 74.8% and 55.8%, respectively, as of december 31, 2014.
as of december 31, 2015, our portfolio of common stocks and other securities with equity risk had a cash market portfolio beta of 1.17, compared to a beta of 1.21 as of december 31, 2014. beta represents a widely used methodology to describe, quantitatively, an investment's market risk characteristics relative to an index such as the standard & poor's 500 composite price index ("s&p 500"). based on the beta analysis, we estimate that if the s&p 500 increases or decreases by 10%, the fair value of our equity investments will increase or decrease by 11.7%, respectively. based upon the information and assumptions we used to calculate beta as of december 31, 2015, we estimate that an immediate increase or decrease in the s&p 500 of 10% would increase or decrease the net fair value of our equity investments by $1.17 billion, compared to $1.05 billion as of december 31, 2014. the selection of a 10% immediate increase or decrease in the s&p 500 should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event.
the beta of our common stocks and other securities with equity risk was determined by calculating the change in the fair value of the portfolio resulting from stressing the equity market up and down 10%. the illustrations noted above may not reflect our actual experience if the future composition of the portfolio (hence its beta) and correlation relationships differ from the historical relationships.
as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, we had separate account assets related to variable annuity and variable life contracts with account values totaling $3.66 billion and $4.40 billion, respectively. equity risk exists for contract charges based on separate account balances and guarantees for death and/or income benefits provided by our variable products. in 2006, we disposed of substantially all of the variable annuity business through reinsurance agreements with the prudential insurance company of america, a subsidiary of prudential financial inc. and therefore mitigated this aspect of our risk. equity risk for our variable life business relates to contract charges and policyholder benefits. total variable life contract charges for 2015 and 2014 were $40 million and $47 million, respectively. separate account liabilities related to variable life contracts were $69 million and $77 million as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
as of december 31, 2015 and 2014 we had $1.42 billion and $1.49 billion, respectively, in equity-indexed annuity liabilities that provide customers with interest crediting rates based on the performance of the s&p 500. we hedge the majority of the risk associated with these liabilities using equity-indexed options and futures and eurodollar futures, maintaining risk within specified value-at-risk limits.
foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. this risk primarily arises from our foreign equity investments, including common stocks, limited partnership interests, and our canadian, northern ireland and indian operations. we also have investments in certain fixed income securities and emerging market fixed income funds that are denominated in foreign currencies; however, derivatives are used to hedge approximately 87% of this foreign currency risk.
as of december 31, 2015, we had $1.97 billion in foreign currency denominated equity investments, $780 million net investment in our foreign subsidiaries, primarily related to our canadian operations, and $17 million in unhedged non-dollar fixed income securities. these amounts were $1.35 billion, $843 million, and $283 million respectively, as of december 31, 2014. 71% of the foreign currency exposure is in the property-liability business.
based upon the information and assumptions used as of december 31, 2015, we estimate that a 10% immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates to which we are exposed would decrease the value of our foreign currency denominated instruments by $278 million, compared with an estimated $235 million decrease as of december 31, 2014. the selection of a 10% immediate decrease in all currency exchange rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event.
the modeling technique we use to report our currency exposure does not take into account correlation among foreign currency exchange rates. even though we believe it is very unlikely that all of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would simultaneously decrease by 10%, we nonetheless stress test our portfolio under this and other hypothetical extreme adverse market scenarios. our actual experience may differ from these results because of assumptions we have used or because significant liquidity and market events could occur that we did not foresee.

pension and other postretirement plans we have defined benefit pension plans, which cover most full-time, certain part-time employees and employee-agents. benefits are based primarily on a cash balance formula, however certain participants have a significant portion of their benefits attributable to a former final average pay formula. 92% of the projected benefit obligation of our primary qualified employee plan is related to the former final average pay formula. see note 17 of the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of these plans and their effect on the consolidated financial statements. the pension and other postretirement plans may be amended or terminated at any time. any revisions could result in significant changes to our obligations and our obligation to fund the plans.
we report unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost in the consolidated statements of financial position as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity. it represents the after-tax differences between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation ("pbo") for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other postretirement plans that have not yet been recognized as a component of net periodic cost. as of december 31, 2015, unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost totaled $1.32 billion comprising $1.52 billion of unrecognized costs related to pension benefits and a $209 million gain related to other postretirement benefits. the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost decreased by $48 million as of december 31, 2015 from $1.36 billion as of december 31, 2014. the measurement of the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost can vary based upon the fluctuations in the fair value of plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for the plans as discussed below. the reduction in the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost is primarily related to actuarial assumptions and census data updates, including increases in the discount rate assumptions, partially offset by lump sum payments at discount rates lower than actuarial assumptions and asset returns that were less than expected.
the components of net periodic pension cost for all pension plans for the years ended december 31 are as follows:

the service cost component is the actuarial present value of the benefits attributed by the plans benefit formula to services rendered by the employees during the period. interest cost is the increase in the pbo in the period due to the passage of time at the discount rate. interest cost fluctuates as the discount rate changes and is also impacted by the related change in the size of the pbo. the decrease or increase in the pbo due to an increase or decrease in the discount rate is deferred and decreases or increases the net actuarial loss. it is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as unrecognized pension benefit cost and may be amortized.
the expected return on plan assets is determined as the product of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the adjusted fair value of plan assets, referred to as the market-related value of plan assets. to determine the market-related value, the fair value of plan assets is adjusted annually so that differences between changes in the fair value of equity securities and hedge fund limited partnerships and the expected long-term rate of return on these securities are recognized into the market-related value of plan assets over a five year period. we believe this is consistent with the long-term nature of pension obligations.
when the actual return on plan assets exceeds the expected return on plan assets it reduces the net actuarial loss; when the expected return exceeds the actual return it increases the net actuarial loss. it is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as unrecognized pension benefit cost and may be amortized. the market-related value adjustment represents the current difference between actual returns and expected returns on equity securities and hedge fund limited partnerships recognized over a five year period. the market-related value adjustment is a deferred net loss of $139 million as of december 31, 2015. the expected return on plan assets fluctuates when the market-related value of plan assets changes and when the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption changes.
amortization of net actuarial loss in pension cost is recorded when the net actuarial loss excluding the unamortized market-related value adjustment exceeds 10% of the greater of the pbo or the market-related value of plan assets. the amount of amortization is equal to the excess divided by the average remaining service period for active employees for each plan, which approximates 10 years for allstate's largest plan. as a result, the effect of changes in the pbo due to changes in the discount rate and changes in the fair value of plan assets may be experienced in our net periodic pension cost in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur.
86
net actuarial loss fluctuates as the discount rate fluctuates, as the actual return on plan assets differ from the expected long-term rate of return on plans assets, and as actual plan experience differs from other actuarial assumptions. net actuarial loss related to changes in the discount rate will change when interest rates change and from amortization of net actuarial loss when there is an excess sufficient to qualify for amortization. net actuarial loss related to changes in the fair value of plan assets will change when plan assets change in fair value and when there is an excess sufficient to qualify for amortization. other net actuarial loss will change over time due to changes in other valuation assumptions and the plan participants or when there is an excess sufficient to qualify for amortization.
an increase in the discount rate decreased the net actuarial loss by $465 million in 2015, a decrease in the discount rate increased the net actuarial loss by $576 million in 2014, and an increase in the discount rate decreased the net actuarial loss by $593 million in 2013. the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets increased the net actuarial loss by $466 million in 2015 and decreased the loss by $144 million and $172 million in 2014, and 2013, respectively.
settlement charges are non-cash charges that accelerate the recognition of unrecognized pension benefit cost, that would have been incurred in subsequent periods, when plan payments, primarily lump sums from qualified pension plans, exceed a threshold of service and interest cost for the period. the value of lump sums paid in 2015 were higher than 2014, in the primary employee plan, but did not exceed the settlement charge threshold. the value of lump sums paid in 2014 were lower as fewer employees retired than in 2013. the value of lump sums paid to employees electing retirement in 2013 was elevated due to historically low interest rates. voluntary retirement activity during the fourth quarter of 2013 was almost five times the typical level.
net periodic pension cost in 2016 is estimated to be $150 million including expected settlement charges of $31 million primarily for agent lump sum payments. expected returns on plan assets and amortization of prior service credits partially offset the other components of pension cost. the increase is primarily due to higher interest costs as a result of increases in discount rates. pension expense is reported consistent with other types of employee compensation and as a result is included in claims expense, operating costs and expenses and investment expense. net periodic pension cost increased in 2015 to $113 million compared to $83 million in 2014 due to higher amortization of net actuarial loss offset by a higher expected return on assets. net periodic pension cost decreased in 2014 to $83 million compared to $495 million in 2013 due to a decrease in service cost from the new benefit formula, a decrease in the amortization expense for the prior year's net actuarial losses which decreased due to a higher discount rate used to value the pension plan and lower settlement charges from fewer lump sum payments. in 2015, 2014 and 2013, net pension cost included non-cash settlement charges resulting from lump sum distributions. settlement charges are likely to continue for some period in the future as we settle our remaining agent pension obligations by making lump sum distributions to agents. the settlement charge threshold for our primary employee plan is lower beginning in 2014 due to the new benefit formula and low interest rates and as a result a lower amount of lump sum benefits may trigger settlement charges in the future. if interest rates increase in 2016, there may be an increase in employees electing retirement, which could trigger settlement charges in 2016.
we anticipate that the net actuarial loss for our pension plans will exceed 10% of the greater of the pbo or the market-related value of assets in 2016 and into the foreseeable future, resulting in additional amortization and net periodic pension cost. the net actuarial loss will be amortized over the remaining service life of active employees (approximately 10 years) or will reverse with increases in the discount rate or better than expected returns on plan assets.
amounts recorded for net periodic pension cost and accumulated other comprehensive income are significantly affected by changes in the assumptions used to determine the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. the discount rate is based on rates at which expected pension benefits attributable to past employee service could effectively be settled on a present value basis at the measurement date. we develop the assumed discount rate by utilizing the weighted average yield of a theoretical dedicated portfolio derived from non-callable bonds and bonds with a make-whole provision available in the bloomberg corporate bond universe having ratings of at least "aa" by s&p or at least "aa" by moody's on the measurement date with cash flows that match expected plan benefit requirements. significant changes in discount rates, such as those caused by changes in the credit spreads, yield curve, the mix of bonds available in the market, the duration of selected bonds and expected benefit payments, may result in volatility in pension cost and accumulated other comprehensive income.
holding other assumptions constant, a hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the discount rate would result in an increase of $33 million, pre-tax, in net periodic pension cost and a $426 million after-tax, increase in the unrecognized pension cost liability recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income as of december 31, 2015, compared to an increase of $31 million, pre-tax, in net periodic pension cost and a $444 million, after-tax, increase in the unrecognized pension cost liability as of december 31, 2014. a hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate would decrease net periodic pension cost by $30 million, pre-tax, and would decrease the unrecognized pension cost liability recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income by $360 million, after-tax, as of december 31, 2015, compared to a decrease in net periodic pension cost of $29 million, pre-tax, and a $377 million, after-tax, decrease in the unrecognized pension cost liability recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income as of december 31, 2014. this non-symmetrical range results from the non-linear relationship between discount rates and pension obligations, and changes in the amortization of unrealized net actuarial gains and losses.
87
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on plan assets. while this rate reflects long-term assumptions and is consistent with long-term historical returns, sustained changes in the market or changes in the mix of plan assets may lead to revisions in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets that may result in variability of pension cost. differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are a component of net actuarial loss and are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
holding other assumptions constant, a hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would result in an increase of $54 million in pension cost as of december 31, 2015, compared to $57 million as of december 31, 2014. a hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease in net periodic pension cost of $54 million as of december 31, 2015, compared to $57 million as of december 31, 2014.
the primary qualified plans have unrealized net gains as of december 31, 2015 of $219 million, a decrease of $291 million from the prior year. $283 million of unrealized gains are related to equity securities as of december 31, 2015 compared to $413 million as of december 31, 2014. during 2015, the two primary qualified plans realized capital gains of $138 million. given the plan's exposure to an increase in interest rates, the plans continue to maintain a shortened duration in the fixed income portfolio.
we target funding levels in accordance with regulations under the internal revenue code ("irc") and generally accepted actuarial principles. our funding levels were within our targeted range as of december 31, 2015. in 2015, we contributed $125 million to our pension plans. we expect to contribute $129 million for the 2016 fiscal year to maintain the plans' funded status. this estimate could change significantly following either an improvement or decline in investment markets.
participating subsidiaries fund the plans' contributions under our master services cost sharing agreement. in addition, as a result of joint and several pension liability rules under the irc and the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended, many liabilities that arise in connection with pension plans are joint and several across all members of a controlled group of entities.
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquiring businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired. the goodwill balances were $823 million and $396 million as of december 31, 2015 for the allstate protection segment and the allstate financial segment, respectively. our reporting units are equivalent to our reporting segments, allstate protection and allstate financial. goodwill is allocated to reporting units based on which unit is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination.
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually. we perform our annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year based upon data as of the close of the third quarter. we also review goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as deteriorating or adverse market conditions, indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of goodwill may exceed its implied fair value.
impairment testing requires the use of estimates and judgments. for purposes of goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the second step of the goodwill test is required. in such instances, the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be determined in a business acquisition. the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill would be recognized as an impairment and recorded as a charge against net income.
to estimate the fair value of our reporting units for our annual impairment test, we initially utilize a stock price and market capitalization analysis and apportion the value between our reporting units using peer company price to book multiples. if the stock price and market capitalization analysis does not result in the fair value of the reporting unit exceeding its carrying value, we may also utilize a peer company price to earnings multiples analysis and/or a discounted cash flow analysis to supplement the stock price and market capitalization analysis. if a combination of valuation techniques are utilized, the analyses would be weighted based on management's judgment of their relevance given current facts and circumstances.
the stock price and market capitalization analysis takes into consideration the quoted market price of our outstanding common stock and includes a control premium, derived from historical insurance industry acquisition activity, in determining the estimated fair value of the consolidated entity before allocating that fair value to individual reporting units. the total market capitalization of the consolidated entity is allocated to the individual reporting units using book value multiples derived from peer company data for the respective reporting units. the peer company price to earnings multiples analysis takes into consideration the price earnings multiples of peer companies for each reporting unit and estimated income from our strategic plan. the discounted cash flow analysis utilizes long term assumptions for revenue growth, capital growth, earnings projections including those used in our strategic plan, and an appropriate discount rate. we apply significant judgment when determining the fair value of our reporting units and when assessing the relationship of market capitalization to the estimated fair value of our reporting units. the valuation analyses described above are subject to critical judgments and assumptions and may be potentially sensitive to variability. estimates of fair value are
88
inherently uncertain and represent management's reasonable expectation regarding future developments. these estimates and the judgments and assumptions utilized may differ from future actual results. declines in the estimated fair value of our reporting units could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which may be material to our results of operations but not our financial position.
during fourth quarter 2015, we completed our annual goodwill impairment test using information as of september 30, 2015. the stock price and market capitalization analysis resulted in the fair value of our reporting units exceeding their respective carrying values. the results of this analysis are supported by the operating performance of the individual reporting units as well as their respective industry sector's performance. goodwill impairment evaluations indicated no impairment as of december 31, 2015 and no reporting unit was at risk of having its carrying value including goodwill exceed its fair value.
capital resources and liquidity 2015 highlights
•   shareholders' equity as of december 31, 2015 was $20.03 billion, a decrease of 10.2% from $22.30 billion as of december 31, 2014.

______________________________
(1)   due to the adoption of new accounting guidance related to the presentation of debt issuance costs, long-term debt is reported net of debt issuance costs. all prior periods have been adjusted.
shareholders' equity decreased in 2015, primarily due to common share repurchases, decreased unrealized net capital gains on investments and dividends paid to shareholders, partially offset by net income. in 2015, we paid dividends of $483 million and $116 million related to our common and preferred shares, respectively. shareholders' equity increased in 2014, primarily due to net income, the issuance of preferred stock and increased unrealized net capital gains on investments, partially offset by common share repurchases, an increase in the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost and dividends paid to shareholders.
debt  in may 2015, federal home loan bank advances of $8 million were repaid. in august 2015, we repurchased principal amounts of $11 million of junior subordinated debentures. we have no debt maturities until 2018. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. for further information on outstanding debt, see note 12 of the consolidated financial statements.
capital resources comprise an increased mix of preferred stock and subordinated debt due to issuances in 2013 and 2014 and the completion of a tender offer to repurchase debt in 2013. as of december 31, 2015, capital resources includes $1.75 billion or 7.0% of preferred stock and $2.04 billion or 8.1% of subordinated debt, a total of 15.1% compared to 13.8% as of december 31, 2014 and 10.2% as of december 31, 2013. these resources increase our strategic flexibility by decreasing our debt to shareholders' equity ratio, which is one determinant of borrowing capacity.
common share repurchases  in march 2015, we commenced a $3 billion common share repurchase program that is expected to be completed by july 2016. as of december 31, 2015, there was $532 million remaining on the common share repurchase program. in february 2015, we completed a $2.5 billion common share repurchase program that commenced in february 2014. during 2015, we repurchased 42.8 million common shares for $2.80 billion in the market.
89
since 1995, we have acquired 645 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $28.23 billion, primarily as part of various stock repurchase programs. we have reissued 127 million common shares since 1995, primarily associated with our equity incentive plans, the 1999 acquisition of american heritage life investment corporation and the 2001 redemption of certain mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. since 1995, total common shares outstanding has decreased by 518 million shares or 57.6%, primarily due to our repurchase programs.
financial ratings and strength  the following table summarizes our senior long-term debt, commercial paper and insurance financial strength ratings as of december 31, 2015.

our ratings are influenced by many factors including our operating and financial performance, asset quality, liquidity, asset/liability management, overall portfolio mix, financial leverage (i.e., debt), exposure to risks such as catastrophes and the current level of operating leverage. the preferred stock and subordinated debentures are viewed as having a common equity component by certain rating agencies and are given equity credit up to a pre-determined limit in our capital structure as determined by their respective methodologies. these respective methodologies consider the existence of certain terms and features in the instruments such as the noncumulative dividend feature in the preferred stock.
in february 2015, a.m. best affirmed the allstate corporation's debt and short-term issuer ratings of a- and amb-1, respectively, and the insurance financial strength ratings of a+ for aic and alic. the outlook for the ratings remained stable. in june 2015, moody's affirmed the allstate corporation's debt and short-term issuer ratings of a3 and p-2, respectively, and the insurance financial strength ratings of aa3 for aic and a1 for alic. the outlook for the ratings remained stable. in july 2015, s&p affirmed the allstate corporation's debt and short-term issuer ratings of a- and a-1, respectively, and the insurance financial strength ratings of aa- for aic and a+ for alic. the outlook for the ratings remained stable.
we have distinct and separately capitalized groups of subsidiaries licensed to sell property and casualty insurance in new jersey and florida that maintain separate group ratings. the ratings of these groups are influenced by the risks that relate specifically to each group. many mortgage companies require property owners to have insurance from an insurance carrier with a secure financial strength rating from an accredited rating agency. in february 2015, a.m. best affirmed the allstate new jersey insurance company, which writes auto and homeowners insurance, rating of a-. the outlook for this rating is stable. allstate new jersey insurance company also has a financial stability rating® of a" from demotech, which was affirmed in october 2015. in july 2015, a.m. best affirmed the castle key insurance company, which underwrites personal lines property insurance in florida, rating of b-. the outlook for the rating was revised to stable from negative. castle key insurance company also has a financial stability rating® of a' from demotech, which was affirmed in october 2015.
beginning in 2015, allstate financial uses a separately capitalized subsidiary, allstate assurance company ("aac"), to write certain life insurance business sold by allstate exclusive agencies and exclusive financial specialists. as aac launched its products throughout the nation, lbl ceased writing that type of new business for allstate financial. lbl life business sold through the allstate agency channel and all lbl payout annuity business continues to be reinsured and serviced by alic. aac has a financial strength rating of a from a.m. best and a1 by moody's as of december 31, 2015.
alic, aic, aac and the allstate corporation are party to an amended and restated intercompany liquidity agreement ("liquidity agreement") which allows for short-term advances of funds to be made between parties for liquidity and other general corporate purposes. the liquidity agreement does not establish a commitment to advance funds on the part of any party. alic and aic each serve as a lender and borrower, aac serves only as a borrower, and the corporation serves only as a lender. aic also has a capital support agreement with alic. under the capital support agreement, aic is committed to provide capital to alic to maintain an adequate capital level. the maximum amount of potential funding under each of these agreements is $1.00 billion.
in addition to the liquidity agreement, the corporation also has an intercompany loan agreement with certain of its subsidiaries, which include, but are not limited to, aic and alic. the amount of intercompany loans available to the corporation's subsidiaries is at the discretion of the corporation. the maximum amount of loans the corporation will have outstanding to all its eligible subsidiaries at any given point in time is limited to $1.00 billion. the corporation may use commercial paper borrowings, bank lines of credit and securities lending to fund intercompany borrowings.
allstate's domestic property-liability and life insurance subsidiaries prepare their statutory-basis financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the applicable state of domicile. statutory surplus is a measure that is often used as a basis for determining dividend paying capacity, operating leverage and premium growth capacity, and it is also reviewed by rating agencies in determining their ratings. property-liability is comprised

of 29 companies, each of which has individual company dividend limitations. as of december 31, 2015, total statutory surplus is $16.49 billion compared to $17.32 billion as of december 31, 2014. property-liability surplus was $13.33 billion as of december 31, 2015, compared to $14.41 billion as of december 31, 2014. allstate financial surplus was $3.16 billion as of december 31, 2015, compared to $2.91 billion as of december 31, 2014. in 2015, we initiated a mortality study for our structured settlement annuities with life contingencies, which is expected to be completed in 2016. the study thus far indicates that annuitants may be living longer and receiving benefits for a longer period than originally estimated. the preliminary results of the study were incorporated in the statutory reserving process and led to a $244 million increase in statutory reserves as of december 31, 2015. this decreased allstate financial's surplus by approximately $175 million, after-tax.
the ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus is a common measure of operating leverage used in the property-casualty insurance industry and serves as an indicator of a company's premium growth capacity. ratios in excess of 3 to 1 are typically considered outside the usual range by insurance regulators and rating agencies, and for homeowners and related coverages that have significant net exposure to natural catastrophes, a ratio of 1 to 1 is typically within the usual range. aic's combined premium to surplus ratio was 1.9x as of december 31, 2015 compared to 1.7x as of december 31, 2014.
the naic has also developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the insurance regulatory information system to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or actions by state insurance regulators. the naic analyzes financial data provided by insurance companies using prescribed ratios, each with defined "usual ranges". additional regulatory scrutiny may occur if a company's ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios. our domestic insurance companies have no significant departure from these ranges.

as of december 31, 2015, we held $7.56 billion of cash, u.s. government and agencies fixed income securities, and public equity securities (excluding non-redeemable preferred stocks and foreign equities) which, under normal market conditions, we would expect to be able to liquidate within one week. in addition, we regularly estimate how much of the total portfolio, which includes high quality corporate fixed income and municipal holdings, can be reasonably liquidated within one quarter. these estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty associated with evolving market conditions. as of december 31, 2015, estimated liquidity available within one quarter without generating significant net realized capital losses was $20.91 billion. as of december 31, 2015, gross unrealized losses related to fixed income and equity securities totaled $1.10 billion.
parent company capital capacity    at the parent holding company level, we have deployable assets totaling $2.62 billion as of december 31, 2015 comprising cash and investments that are generally saleable within one quarter. the substantial earnings capacity of the operating subsidiaries is the primary source of capital generation for the corporation. in 2016, aic will have the capacity to pay dividends currently estimated at $1.71 billion without prior regulatory approval. this provides funds for the parent company's fixed charges and other corporate purposes. in addition, we have access to $1.00 billion of funds from either commercial paper issuance or an unsecured revolving credit facility.
in 2015, aic paid dividends totaling $2.31 billion to its parent, allstate insurance holdings, llc ("aih"), which then paid $2.30 billion of dividends to the corporation. in 2014, aic paid dividends totaling $2.47 billion to its parent, aih, which then paid $2.46 billion of dividends to the corporation. in december 2014, aic repurchased 2,967 common shares held by its parent, aih, for an aggregate cash price of $1.20 billion, pursuant to the stock repurchase agreement between aic and aih entered into as of december 9, 2014. a subsequent return of capital totaling $1.20 billion was paid by aih to the corporation in december 2014. in 2013, aic paid dividends totaling $1.95 billion to its parent, aih which then paid the same amount of dividends to the corporation. in 2015, 2014 and 2013, alic paid $103 million, $700 million and $700 million, respectively, of returns of capital, repayments of surplus notes and dividends to aic. in 2015, 2014 and 2013, american heritage life insurance company paid dividends totaling $80 million, $106 million and $74 million, respectively, to allstate financial insurance holdings corporation, which then paid zero, $42 million and $40 million, respectively, of dividends to the corporation. there were no capital contributions paid by the corporation to aic in 2015, 2014 and 2013. there were no capital contributions by aic to alic in 2015, 2014 or 2013.
dividends may not be paid or declared on our common stock and shares of common stock may not be repurchased unless the full dividends for the latest completed dividend period on our preferred stock have been declared and paid or provided for. we are prohibited from declaring or paying dividends on our preferred stock if we fail to meet specified capital adequacy, net income or shareholders' equity levels, except out of the net proceeds of common stock issued during the 90 days prior to the date of declaration. as of december 31, 2015, we satisfied all of the tests with no current restrictions on the payment of preferred stock dividends.
the terms of our outstanding subordinated debentures also prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our common or preferred stock or redeeming, purchasing, acquiring, or making liquidation payments on our common stock or preferred stock if we have elected to defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures, subject to certain limited exceptions. in 2015, we did not defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures.
additional borrowings to support liquidity are as follows:
•   the corporation has access to a commercial paper facility with a borrowing limit of $1.00 billion to cover short-term cash needs. as of december 31, 2015, there were no balances outstanding and therefore the remaining borrowing capacity was $1.00 billion; however, the outstanding balance can fluctuate daily.
•   the corporation, aic and alic have access to a $1.00 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is available for short-term liquidity requirements. in april 2015, we extended the maturity date of this facility to april 2020. the facility is fully subscribed among 11 lenders with the largest commitment being $115 million. the commitments of the lenders are several and no lender is responsible for any other lender's commitment if such lender fails to make a loan under the facility. this facility contains an increase provision that would allow up to an additional $500 million of borrowing. this facility has a financial covenant requiring that we not exceed a 37.5% debt to capitalization ratio as defined in the agreement. this ratio was 12.0% as of december 31, 2015. although the right to borrow under the facility is not subject to a minimum rating requirement, the costs of maintaining the facility and borrowing under it are based on the ratings of our senior unsecured, unguaranteed long-term debt. there were no borrowings under the credit facility during 2015.
•   the corporation has access to a universal shelf registration statement that was filed with the securities and exchange commission on april 30, 2015. we can use this shelf registration to issue an unspecified amount of debt securities, common stock (including 519 million shares of treasury stock as of december 31, 2015), preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and securities of trust subsidiaries. the specific terms of any securities we issue under this registration statement will be provided in the applicable prospectus supplements.

______________________________
(1)   includes $1.86 billion of liabilities with a contractual surrender charge of less than 5% of the account balance.
(2)   $1.28 billion of the contracts with market value adjusted surrenders have a 30-45 day period at the end of their initial and subsequent interest rate guarantee periods (which are typically 5, 7 or 10 years) during which there is no surrender charge or market value adjustment. $325 million of these contracts have their 30-45 day window period in 2016.
(3)   88% of these contracts have a minimum interest crediting rate guarantee of 3% or higher.
(4)   includes $812 million of contractholder funds on variable annuities reinsured to the prudential insurance company of america, a subsidiary of prudential financial inc., in 2006.
retail life and annuity products may be surrendered by customers for a variety of reasons. reasons unique to individual customers include a current or unexpected need for cash or a change in life insurance coverage needs. other key factors that may impact the likelihood of customer surrender include the level of the contract surrender charge, the length of time the contract has been in force, distribution channel, market interest rates, equity market conditions and potential tax implications. in addition, the propensity for retail life insurance policies to lapse is lower than it is for fixed annuities because of the need for the insured to be re-underwritten upon policy replacement. the surrender and partial withdrawal rate on deferred fixed annuities and interest-sensitive life insurance products, based on the beginning of year contractholder funds, was 7.1% and 9.9% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. allstate financial strives to promptly pay customers who request cash surrenders; however, statutory regulations generally provide up to six months in most states to fulfill surrender requests.
our asset-liability management practices enable us to manage the differences between the cash flows generated by our investment portfolio and the expected cash flow requirements of our life insurance and annuity product obligations.
certain remote events and circumstances could constrain our liquidity. those events and circumstances include, for example, a catastrophe resulting in extraordinary losses, a downgrade in our senior long-term debt ratings to non-investment grade status, a downgrade in aic's financial strength ratings, or a downgrade in alic's financial strength ratings. the rating agencies also consider the interdependence of our individually rated entities; therefore, a rating change in one entity could potentially affect the ratings of other related entities.

______________________________
(1)   business unit cash flows reflect the elimination of intersegment dividends, contributions and borrowings.
property-liability  higher cash provided by operating activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to increased premiums partially offset by higher claims payments, higher contributions to benefit plans, lower net investment income and higher income tax payments. lower cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher claim payments, the proceeds received in 2013 from the surrender of company owned life insurance and higher income tax payments, partially offset by increased premiums and lower contributions to benefit plans.
cash used in investing activities in 2015 compared to cash provided by investing activities in 2014 was primarily the result of decreased sales of securities, partially offset by decreased purchases of securities. cash provided by investing activities in 2014 compared to cash used in investing activities in 2013 was primarily the result of increased sales of securities and short-term investments, partially offset by increased purchases of securities. increased sales and purchases of securities resulted from more active portfolio management.
93
allstate financial  lower cash provided by operating activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower net investment income and higher income tax payments, partially offset by higher premiums on accident and health and traditional life insurance products. lower cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to lower net investment income and higher income tax payments, partially offset by higher premiums on accident and health and traditional life insurance products.
lower cash provided by investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was the result of lower cash used in financing activities due to lower contractholder fund disbursements. lower cash was provided by investing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 as proceeds from the sale of lbl and higher sales of investments were more than offset by lower collections and higher purchases of investments. lower collections resulted from funding a large institutional product maturity in 2013 from the portfolio.
lower cash used in financing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower contractholder benefits and withdrawals on fixed annuities and interest-sensitive life insurance, partially offset by lower deposits. lower cash used in financing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to a $1.75 billion institutional product maturity in 2013 and lower contractholder benefits and withdrawals on fixed annuities and interest-sensitive life insurance, partially offset by lower deposits. for quantification of the changes in contractholder funds, see the allstate financial segment section of the md&a.
corporate and other  fluctuations in the corporate and other operating cash flows were primarily due to the timing of intercompany settlements. investing activities primarily relate to investments in the parent company portfolio. financing cash flows of the corporate and other segment reflect actions such as fluctuations in dividends to shareholders of the allstate corporation, common share repurchases, short-term debt, repayment of debt and proceeds from the issuance of debt and preferred stock; therefore, financing cash flows are affected when we increase or decrease the level of these activities.

______________________________
(1)   liabilities for collateral are typically fully secured with cash or short-term investments. we manage our short-term liquidity position to ensure the availability of a sufficient amount of liquid assets to extinguish short-term liabilities as they come due in the normal course of business, including utilizing potential sources of liquidity as disclosed previously.
(2)   contractholder funds represent interest-bearing liabilities arising from the sale of products such as interest-sensitive life, fixed annuities, including immediate annuities without life contingencies, and institutional products. the reserve for life-contingent contract benefits relates primarily to traditional life insurance, immediate annuities with life contingencies and voluntary accident and health insurance. these amounts reflect the present value of estimated cash payments to be made to contractholders and policyholders. certain of these contracts, such as immediate annuities without life contingencies and institutional products, involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of the payment is essentially fixed and determinable. these amounts relate to (i) policies or contracts where we are currently making payments and will continue to do so and (ii) contracts where the timing of a portion or all of the payments has been determined by the contract. other contracts, such as interest-sensitive life, fixed deferred annuities, traditional life insurance and voluntary accident and health insurance, involve payment obligations where a portion or all of the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain. for these contracts, we are not currently making payments and will not make payments until (i) the occurrence of an insurable event such as death or illness or (ii) the occurrence of a payment triggering event such as the surrender or partial withdrawal on a policy or deposit contract, which is outside of our control. for immediate annuities with life contingencies, the amount of future payments is uncertain since payments will continue as long as the annuitant lives. we have estimated the timing of payments related to these contracts based on historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns. uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality, morbidity, expenses, customer lapse and withdrawal activity, estimated additional deposits for interest-sensitive life contracts, and renewal premium for life policies, which may significantly impact both the timing and amount of future payments. such cash outflows reflect adjustments for the estimated timing of mortality, retirement, and other appropriate factors, but are undiscounted with respect to interest. as a result, the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liabilities of $21.30 billion for contractholder funds and $12.25 billion for reserve for life-contingent
94
contract benefits as included in the consolidated statements of financial position as of december 31, 2015. the liability amount in the consolidated statements of financial position reflects the discounting for interest as well as adjustments for the timing of other factors as described above.
(3)   amount differs from the balance presented on the consolidated statements of financial position as of december 31, 2015 because the long-term debt amount above includes interest and excludes debt issuance costs.
(4)   our payment obligations relating to capital lease obligations, operating leases, unconditional purchase obligations and pension and other postretirement benefits ("opeb") contributions are managed within the structure of our intermediate to long-term liquidity management program.
(5)   the pension plans' obligations in the next 12 months represent our planned contributions where the benefit obligation exceeds the assets, and the remaining years' contributions are projected based on the average remaining service period using the current underfunded status of the plans. the opeb plans' obligations are estimated based on the expected benefits to be paid. these liabilities are discounted with respect to interest, and as a result the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liability amount of $549 million included in other liabilities and accrued expenses on the consolidated statements of financial position.
(6)   reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense is an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including claims that have been ibnr as of the balance sheet date. we have estimated the timing of these payments based on our historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns. however, the timing of these payments may vary significantly from the amounts shown above, especially for ibnr claims. the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts which are our best estimates. the reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense includes loss reserves related to asbestos and environmental claims as of december 31, 2015, of $1.42 billion and $222 million, respectively.
(7)   other liabilities primarily include accrued expenses and certain benefit obligations and claim payments and other checks outstanding. certain of these long-term liabilities are discounted with respect to interest, as a result the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liability amount by $7 million.
(8)   balance sheet liabilities not included in the table above include unearned and advance premiums of $12.99 billion and gross deferred tax liabilities of $1.93 billion. these items were excluded as they do not meet the definition of a contractual liability as we are not contractually obligated to pay these amounts to third parties. rather, they represent an accounting mechanism that allows us to present our financial statements on an accrual basis. in addition, other liabilities of $223 million were not included in the table above because they did not represent a contractual obligation or the amount and timing of their eventual payment was sufficiently uncertain.
(9)   net unrecognized tax benefits represent our potential future obligation to the taxing authority for a tax position that was not recognized in the consolidated financial statements. we believe it is reasonably possible that the liability balance will not significantly increase within the next twelve months. the resolution of this obligation may be for an amount different than what we have accrued.
our contractual commitments as of december 31, 2015 and the periods in which the commitments expire are shown in the following table.

contractual commitments represent investment commitments such as private placements, limited partnership interests, municipal bonds and other loans. limited partnership interests are typically funded over the commitment period which is shorter than the contractual expiration date of the partnership and as a result, the actual timing of the funding may vary.
we have agreements in place for services we conduct, generally at cost, between subsidiaries relating to insurance, reinsurance, loans and capitalization. all material intercompany transactions have been appropriately eliminated in consolidation. intercompany transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate departments of insurance as required.

enterprise risk and return management in addition to the normal risks of business, allstate is subject to significant risks as an insurer and a provider of other products and financial services. these risks are discussed in more detail in the risk factors section of this document. allstate manages enterprise risk under an integrated enterprise risk and return management ("errm") framework with risk-return principles, governance, modeling and analytics, and importantly, transparent management dialogue. this framework provides a comprehensive view of risks and opportunities and is used by senior leaders and business managers to provide risk and return insight and drive strategic and business decisions. allstate's risk management strategies adapt to changes in business and market environments and seek to optimize returns. allstate continually validates and improves its errm practices by benchmarking and securing external perspectives for our processes.
our risk-return principles define how we operate and guide decision-making around risk and return. these principles state that, first and foremost, our priority is to protect solvency, comply with laws and act with integrity. building upon this foundation, we strive to build strategic value and optimize risks and returns.
errm governance includes board oversight, an executive management committee structure, and chief risk officers ("cros"). the allstate corporation board of directors ("allstate board") has overall responsibility for oversight of management's design and implementation of errm, including integration with strategy and operations. the risk and return committee of the allstate board oversees effectiveness of the errm framework, governance structure and decision-making, while focusing on the
95
company's risk and return position. the audit committee oversees effectiveness of management's control framework for risks. the enterprise risk & return council ("errc") is allstate's senior risk management committee that directs errm by establishing risk-return targets, determining economic capital levels and directing integrated strategies and actions from an enterprise perspective. the errc consists of allstate's chief executive officer, president, business unit presidents, chief investment officer, enterprise and business unit chief risk officers and chief financial officers, general counsel and treasurer.
cros are appointed for the enterprise and for allstate protection, allstate financial, allstate investments, and allstate's technology organization. collectively, the cros create an integrated approach to risk and return management to ensure risk management practices and strategies are aligned with allstate's overall enterprise objectives. various enterprise risk and return committees with cro, senior management and cross-functional business representation govern management of key risks. the shared errm framework establishes a basis for transparency and dialogue across the organization and for continuous learning by embedding the risk and return management culture of identifying, measuring, managing, monitoring and reporting risks.
our errm governance is supported with an analytic framework to manage significant insurance, investment, financial, strategic, and operational risk exposures and optimize returns on risk-adjusted capital. management and the errc use enterprise stochastic modeling, risk expertise and judgment to determine an appropriate level of targeted enterprise economic capital to hold considering a broad range of risk objectives and external constraints. these include limiting risks of financial stress, insolvency, likelihood of capital stress and volatility, maintaining stakeholder value and financial strength ratings and satisfying regulatory and rating agency risk-based capital requirements. potential risk events that we consider for capital evaluations include catastrophe and pandemic events and investment market shocks. we generally assess solvency on a statutory accounting basis, but also consider gaap volatility. current enterprise economic capital, which exceeds targeted levels, approximates a combination of total statutory surplus and deployable invested assets at the parent holding company level which were $16.49 billion and $2.62 billion, respectively, as of december 31, 2015.
using our governance and analytic framework, allstate designs business and enterprise strategies that seek to optimize returns on risk-adjusted capital. examples include reducing exposure to rising interest rates; improving auto profitability; shifting our investment portfolio mix over time to have less reliance on investments with returns that come primarily from interest payments to investments in which we have ownership interests and a greater proportion of return is derived from idiosyncratic asset or operating performance; and accelerating homeowners growth while maintaining profitability.
application of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. the most critical estimates, presented in the order they appear in the consolidated statements of financial position, include those used in determining:
•fair value of financial assets
•impairment of fixed income and equity securities
•deferred policy acquisition costs amortization
•reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense estimation
•reserve for life-contingent contract benefits estimation in making these determinations, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our businesses and operations. it is reasonably likely that changes in these estimates could occur from period to period and result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
a brief summary of each of these critical accounting estimates follows. for a more detailed discussion of the effect of these estimates on our consolidated financial statements, and the judgments and assumptions related to these estimates, see the referenced sections of this document. for a complete summary of our significant accounting policies, see the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
fair value of financial assets  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. we are responsible for the determination of fair value of financial assets and the supporting assumptions and methodologies. we use independent third-party valuation service providers, broker quotes and internal pricing methods to determine fair values. we obtain or calculate only one single quote or price for each financial instrument.
valuation service providers typically obtain data about market transactions and other key valuation model inputs from multiple sources and, through the use of proprietary models, produce valuation information in the form of a single fair value for individual fixed income and other securities for which a fair value has been requested under the terms of our agreements. the inputs used by
96
the valuation service providers include, but are not limited to, market prices from recently completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities, interest rate yield curves, credit spreads, liquidity spreads, currency rates, and other information, as applicable. credit and liquidity spreads are typically implied from completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities. valuation service providers also use proprietary discounted cash flow models that are widely accepted in the financial services industry and similar to those used by other market participants to value the same financial instruments. the valuation models take into account, among other things, market observable information as of the measurement date, as described above, as well as the specific attributes of the security being valued including its term, interest rate, credit rating, industry sector, and where applicable, collateral quality and other issue or issuer specific information. executing valuation models effectively requires seasoned professional judgment and experience. for certain equity securities, valuation service providers provide market quotations for completed transactions on the measurement date. in cases where market transactions or other market observable data is limited, the extent to which judgment is applied varies inversely with the availability of market observable information.
for certain of our financial assets measured at fair value, where our valuation service providers cannot provide fair value determinations, we obtain a single non-binding price quote from a broker familiar with the security who, similar to our valuation service providers, may consider transactions or activity in similar securities among other information. the brokers providing price quotes are generally from the brokerage divisions of leading financial institutions with market making, underwriting and distribution expertise regarding the security subject to valuation.
the fair value of certain financial assets, including privately placed corporate fixed income securities and certain free-standing derivatives, for which our valuation service providers or brokers do not provide fair value determinations, is determined using valuation methods and models widely accepted in the financial services industry. our internal pricing methods are primarily based on models using discounted cash flow methodologies that develop a single best estimate of fair value. our models generally incorporate inputs that we believe are representative of inputs other market participants would use to determine fair value of the same instruments, including yield curves, quoted market prices of comparable securities or instruments, published credit spreads, and other applicable market data as well as instrument-specific characteristics that include, but are not limited to, coupon rates, expected cash flows, sector of the issuer, and call provisions. judgment is required in developing these fair values. as a result, the fair value of these financial assets may differ from the amount actually received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. moreover, the use of different valuation assumptions may have a material effect on the financial assets' fair values.
for most of our financial assets measured at fair value, all significant inputs are based on or corroborated by market observable data and significant management judgment does not affect the periodic determination of fair value. the determination of fair value using discounted cash flow models involves management judgment when significant model inputs are not based on or corroborated by market observable data. however, where market observable data is available, it takes precedence, and as a result, no range of reasonably likely inputs exists from which the basis of a sensitivity analysis could be constructed.
we gain assurance that our financial assets are appropriately valued through the execution of various processes and controls designed to ensure the overall reasonableness and consistent application of valuation methodologies, including inputs and assumptions, and compliance with accounting standards. for fair values received from third parties or internally estimated, our processes and controls are designed to ensure that the valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistently applied, the inputs and assumptions are reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value, and the fair values are accurately recorded. for example, on a continuing basis, we assess the reasonableness of individual fair values that have stale security prices or that exceed certain thresholds as compared to previous fair values received from valuation service providers or brokers or derived from internal models. we perform procedures to understand and assess the methodologies, processes and controls of valuation service providers. in addition, we may validate the reasonableness of fair values by comparing information obtained from valuation service providers or brokers to other third party valuation sources for selected securities. we perform ongoing price validation procedures such as back-testing of actual sales, which corroborate the various inputs used in internal models to market observable data. when fair value determinations are expected to be more variable, we validate them through reviews by members of management who have relevant expertise and who are independent of those charged with executing investment transactions.
we also perform an analysis to determine whether there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset when compared to normal market activity, and if so, whether transactions may not be orderly. among the indicators we consider in determining whether a significant decrease in the volume and level of market activity for a specific asset has occurred include the level of new issuances in the primary market, trading volume in the secondary market, level of credit spreads over historical levels, bid-ask spread, and price consensuses among market participants and sources. if evidence indicates that prices are based on transactions that are not orderly, we place little, if any, weight on the transaction price and will estimate fair value using an internal model. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, we did not adjust fair values provided by our valuation service providers or brokers or substitute them with an internal model for such securities.

impairment of fixed income and equity securities for investments classified as available for sale, the difference between fair value and amortized cost for fixed income securities and cost for equity securities, net of certain other items and deferred income taxes (as disclosed in note 5), is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated statements of financial position and is not reflected in the operating results of any period until reclassified to net income upon the consummation of a transaction with an unrelated third party or when a write-down is recorded due to an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. we have a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate each fixed income and equity security whose carrying value may be other-than-temporarily impaired.
for each fixed income security in an unrealized loss position, we assess whether management with the appropriate authority has made the decision to sell or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis for reasons such as liquidity, contractual or regulatory purposes. if a security meets either of these criteria, the security's decline in fair value is considered other than temporary and is recorded in earnings.
if we have not made the decision to sell the fixed income security and it is not more likely than not we will be required to sell the fixed income security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we evaluate whether we expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to be collected from the fixed income security, discounted at the security's original or current effective rate, as appropriate, to calculate a recovery value and determine whether a credit loss exists. the determination of cash flow estimates is inherently subjective and methodologies may vary depending on facts and circumstances specific to the security. all reasonably available information relevant to the collectability of the security, including past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable assumptions and forecasts, are considered when developing the estimate of cash flows expected to be collected. that information generally includes, but is not limited to, the remaining payment terms of the security, prepayment speeds, foreign exchange rates, the financial condition and future earnings potential of the issue or issuer, expected defaults, expected recoveries, the value of underlying collateral, vintage, geographic concentration, available reserves or escrows, current subordination levels, third party guarantees and other credit enhancements. other information, such as industry analyst reports and forecasts, sector credit ratings, financial condition of the bond insurer for insured fixed income securities, and other market data relevant to the realizability of contractual cash flows, may also be considered. the estimated fair value of collateral will be used to estimate recovery value if we determine that the security is dependent on the liquidation of collateral for ultimate settlement. if the estimated recovery value is less than the amortized cost of the security, a credit loss exists and an other-than-temporary impairment for the difference between the estimated recovery value and amortized cost is recorded in earnings. the portion of the unrealized loss related to factors other than credit remains classified in accumulated other comprehensive income. if we determine that the fixed income security does not have sufficient cash flow or other information to estimate a recovery value for the security, we may conclude that the entire decline in fair value is deemed to be credit related and the loss is recorded in earnings.
there are a number of assumptions and estimates inherent in evaluating impairments of equity securities and determining if they are other than temporary, including: 1) our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value; 2) the financial condition, near-term and long-term prospects of the issue or issuer, including relevant industry specific market conditions and trends, geographic location and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices; 3) the specific reasons that a security is in an unrealized loss position, including overall market conditions which could affect liquidity; and 4) the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost.
once assumptions and estimates are made, any number of changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to subsequently determine that a fixed income or equity security is other-than-temporarily impaired, including: 1) general economic conditions that are worse than previously forecasted or that have a greater adverse effect on a particular issuer or industry sector than originally estimated; 2) changes in the facts and circumstances related to a particular issue or issuer's ability to meet all of its contractual obligations; and 3) changes in facts and circumstances that result in management's decision to sell or result in our assessment that it is more likely than not we will be required to sell before recovery of the amortized cost basis of a fixed income security or causes a change in our ability or intent to hold an equity security until it recovers in value. changes in assumptions, facts and circumstances could result in additional charges to earnings in future periods to the extent that losses are realized. the charge to earnings, while potentially significant to net income, would not have a significant effect on shareholders' equity, since our securities are designated
98
as available for sale and carried at fair value and as a result, any related unrealized loss, net of deferred income taxes and related dac, deferred sales inducement costs and reserves for life-contingent contract benefits, would already be reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity.
the determination of the amount of other-than-temporary impairment is an inherently subjective process based on periodic evaluations of the factors described above. such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. we update our evaluations regularly and reflect changes in other-than-temporary impairments in results of operations as such evaluations are revised. the use of different methodologies and assumptions in the determination of the amount of other-than-temporary impairments may have a material effect on the amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements.
for additional detail on investment impairments, see note 5 of the consolidated financial statements.
deferred policy acquisition costs amortization  we incur significant costs in connection with acquiring insurance policies and investment contracts. in accordance with gaap, costs that are related directly to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance policies and investment contracts are deferred and recorded as an asset on the consolidated statements of financial position.
dac related to property-liability contracts is amortized into income as premiums are earned, typically over periods of six or twelve months. the amortization methodology for dac related to allstate financial policies and contracts includes significant assumptions and estimates.
dac related to traditional life insurance is amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the estimated revenues on such business. significant assumptions relating to estimated premiums, investment returns, as well as mortality, persistency and expenses to administer the business are established at the time the policy is issued and are generally not revised during the life of the policy. the assumptions for determining the timing and amount of dac amortization are consistent with the assumptions used to calculate the reserve for life-contingent contract benefits. any deviations from projected business in force resulting from actual policy terminations differing from expected levels and any estimated premium deficiencies may result in a change to the rate of amortization in the period such events occur. generally, the amortization periods for these policies approximates the estimated lives of the policies. the recovery of dac is dependent upon the future profitability of the business. we periodically review the adequacy of reserves and recoverability of dac for these policies on an aggregate basis using actual experience. we aggregate all traditional life insurance products and immediate annuities with life contingencies in the analysis. in the event actual experience is significantly adverse compared to the original assumptions and a premium deficiency is determined to exist, any remaining unamortized dac balance must be expensed to the extent not recoverable and a premium deficiency reserve may be required if the remaining dac balance is insufficient to absorb the deficiency. in 2015, 2014 and 2013, our reviews concluded that no premium deficiency adjustments were necessary, primarily due to projected profit from traditional life insurance more than offsetting the projected losses in immediate annuities with life contingencies.
dac related to interest-sensitive life insurance and fixed annuities is amortized in proportion to the incidence of the total present value of gross profits, which includes both actual historical gross profits ("agp") and estimated future gross profits ("egp") expected to be earned over the estimated lives of the contracts. the amortization is net of interest on the prior period dac balance using rates established at the inception of the contracts. actual amortization periods generally range from 15-30 years; however, incorporating estimates of the rate of customer surrenders, partial withdrawals and deaths generally results in the majority of the dac being amortized during the surrender charge period, which is typically 10-20 years for interest-sensitive life and 5-10 years for fixed annuities. the cumulative dac amortization is reestimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to income when there is a difference between the incidence of actual versus expected gross profits in a reporting period or when there is a change in total egp.
agp and egp primarily consist of the following components: contract charges for the cost of insurance less mortality costs and other benefits (benefit margin); investment income and realized capital gains and losses less interest credited (investment margin); and surrender and other contract charges less maintenance expenses (expense margin). the principal assumptions for determining the amount of egp are persistency, mortality, expenses, investment returns, including capital gains and losses on assets supporting contract liabilities, interest crediting rates to contractholders, and the effects of any hedges, and these assumptions are reasonably likely to have the greatest impact on the amount of dac amortization. changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to reasonably predict their future movements or offsetting impacts over time.
each reporting period, dac amortization is recognized in proportion to agp for that period adjusted for interest on the prior period dac balance. this amortization process includes an assessment of agp compared to egp, the actual amount of business remaining in force and realized capital gains and losses on investments supporting the product liability. the impact of realized capital gains and losses on amortization of dac depends upon which product liability is supported by the assets that give rise to the gain or loss. if the agp is greater than egp in the period, but the total egp is unchanged, the amount of dac amortization will generally increase, resulting in a current period decrease to earnings. the opposite result generally occurs when the agp is
99
less than the egp in the period, but the total egp is unchanged. however, when dac amortization or a component of gross profits for a quarterly period is potentially negative (which would result in an increase of the dac balance) as a result of negative agp, the specific facts and circumstances surrounding the potential negative amortization are considered to determine whether it is appropriate for recognition in the consolidated financial statements. negative amortization is only recorded when the increased dac balance is determined to be recoverable based on facts and circumstances. for products whose supporting investments are exposed to capital losses in excess of our expectations which may cause periodic agp to become temporarily negative, egp and agp utilized in dac amortization may be modified to exclude the excess capital losses.
annually, we review and update the assumptions underlying the projections of egp, including persistency, mortality, expenses, investment returns, comprising investment income and realized capital gains and losses, interest crediting rates and the effect of any hedges, using our experience and industry experience. at each reporting period, we assess whether any revisions to assumptions used to determine dac amortization are required. these reviews and updates may result in amortization acceleration or deceleration, which are referred to as "dac unlocking". if the update of assumptions causes total egp to increase, the rate of dac amortization will generally decrease, resulting in a current period increase to earnings. a decrease to earnings generally occurs when the assumption update causes the total egp to decrease.

in 2014, dac amortization acceleration for changes in the investment margin component of egp related to interest-sensitive life insurance and fixed annuities and was due to lower projected investment returns. the acceleration related to benefit margin primarily related to interest-sensitive life insurance and was due to an increase in projected mortality. the deceleration related to expense margin primarily related to interest-sensitive life insurance and was due to a decrease in projected expenses.
in 2013, dac amortization deceleration for changes in the investment margin component of egp primarily related to fixed annuities and interest-sensitive life insurance and was due to increased projected investment margins. the acceleration related to benefit margin was primarily due to interest-sensitive life insurance and was due to an increase in projected mortality. the acceleration related to expense margin related to interest-sensitive life insurance and was due to an increase in projected expenses.

reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense estimation reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims and claims expenses under insurance policies we have issued. property-liability underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of property-liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves. these reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including ibnr, as of the financial statement date.
characteristics of reserves reserves are established independently of business segment management for each business segment and line of business based on estimates of the ultimate cost to settle claims, less losses that have been paid. the significant lines of business are auto, homeowners, and other personal lines for allstate protection, and asbestos, environmental, and other
100
discontinued lines for discontinued lines and coverages. allstate protection's claims are typically reported promptly with relatively little reporting lag between the date of occurrence and the date the loss is reported. auto and homeowners liability losses generally take an average of about two years to settle, while auto physical damage, homeowners property and other personal lines have an average settlement time of less than one year. discontinued lines and coverages involve long-tail losses, such as those related to asbestos and environmental claims, which often involve substantial reporting lags and extended times to settle.
reserves are the difference between the estimated ultimate cost of losses incurred and the amount of paid losses as of the reporting date. reserves are estimated for both reported and unreported claims, and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling all incurred claims. we update most of our reserve estimates quarterly and as new information becomes available or as events emerge that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims. changes in prior reserve estimates (reserve reestimates), which may be material, are determined by comparing updated estimates of ultimate losses to prior estimates, and the differences are recorded as property-liability insurance claims and claims expense in the consolidated statements of operations in the period such changes are determined. estimating the ultimate cost of claims and claims expenses is an inherently uncertain and complex process involving a high degree of judgment and is subject to the evaluation of numerous variables.
the actuarial methods used to develop reserve estimates reserve estimates are derived by using several different actuarial estimation methods that are variations on one primary actuarial technique. the actuarial technique is known as a "chain ladder" estimation process in which historical loss patterns are applied to actual paid losses and reported losses (paid losses plus individual case reserves established by claim adjusters) for an accident year or a report year to create an estimate of how losses are likely to develop over time. an accident year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims occurred. a report year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims are reported. both classifications are used to prepare estimates of required reserves for payments to be made in the future. the key assumptions affecting our reserve estimates comprise data elements including claim counts, paid losses, case reserves, and development factors calculated with this data.
in the chain ladder estimation technique, a ratio (development factor) is calculated which compares current period results to results in the prior period for each accident year. a three-year or two-year average development factor, based on historical results, is usually multiplied by the current period experience to estimate the development of losses of each accident year into the next time period. the development factors for the future time periods for each accident year are compounded over the remaining future periods to calculate an estimate of ultimate losses for each accident year. the implicit assumption of this technique is that an average of historical development factors is predictive of future loss development, as the significant size of our experience database achieves a high degree of statistical credibility in actuarial projections of this type. the effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process, the implicit assumption being that a multi-year average development factor includes an adequate provision. occasionally, unusual aberrations in loss patterns are caused by external and internal factors such as changes in claim reporting, settlement patterns, unusually large losses, process changes, legal or regulatory changes, and other influences. in these instances, analyses of alternate development factor selections are performed to evaluate the effect of these factors and actuarial judgment is applied to make appropriate development factor assumptions needed to develop a best estimate of ultimate losses.
how reserve estimates are established and updated reserve estimates are developed at a very detailed level, and the results of these numerous micro-level best estimates are aggregated to form a consolidated reserve estimate. for example, over one thousand actuarial estimates of the types described above are prepared each quarter to estimate losses for each line of insurance, major components of losses (such as coverages and perils), major states or groups of states and for reported losses and ibnr. the actuarial methods described above are used to analyze the settlement patterns of claims by determining the development factors for specific data elements that are necessary components of a reserve estimation process. development factors are calculated quarterly and periodically throughout the year for data elements such as claim counts reported and settled, paid losses, and paid losses combined with case reserves. the calculation of development factors from changes in these data elements also impacts claim severity trends, which is a common industry reference used to explain changes in reserve estimates. the historical development patterns for these data elements are used as the assumptions to calculate reserve estimates.
often, several different estimates are prepared for each detailed component, incorporating alternative analyses of changing claim settlement patterns and other influences on losses, from which we select our best estimate for each component, occasionally incorporating additional analyses and actuarial judgment, as described above. these micro-level estimates are not based on a single set of assumptions. actuarial judgments that may be applied to these components of certain micro-level estimates generally do not have a material impact on the consolidated level of reserves. moreover, this detailed micro-level process does not permit or result in a compilation of a company-wide roll up to generate a range of needed loss reserves that would be meaningful. based on our review of these estimates, our best estimate of required reserves for each state/line/coverage component is recorded for each accident year, and the required reserves for each component are summed to create the reserve balance carried on our consolidated statements of financial position.
reserves are reestimated quarterly and periodically throughout the year, by combining historical results with current actual results to calculate new development factors. this process incorporates the historic and latest actual trends, and other underlying changes in the data elements used to calculate reserve estimates. new development factors are likely to differ from previous
101
development factors used in prior reserve estimates because actual results (claims reported or settled, losses paid, or changes to case reserves) occur differently than the implied assumptions contained in the previous development factor calculations. if claims reported, paid losses, or case reserve changes are greater or less than the levels estimated by previous development factors, reserve reestimates increase or decrease. when actual development of these data elements is different than the historical development pattern used in a prior period reserve estimate, a new reserve is determined. the difference between indicated reserves based on new reserve estimates and recorded reserves (the previous estimate) is the amount of reserve reestimate and is recognized as an increase or decrease in property-liability insurance claims and claims expense in the consolidated statements of operations. total property-liability net reserve reestimates, after-tax, as a percent of net income applicable to common shareholders were (2.6)% unfavorable in 2015, 2.0% favorable in 2014 and 3.5% favorable in 2013. the 3-year average of net reserve reestimates as a percentage of total reserves was a favorable 0.2% for property-liability, a favorable 0.9% for allstate protection and an unfavorable 6.4% for discontinued lines and coverages, each of these results being consistent within a reasonable actuarial tolerance for our respective businesses. a more detailed discussion of reserve reestimates is presented in the property-liability claims and claims expense reserves section of the md&a.

allstate protection reserve estimates factors affecting reserve estimates reserve estimates are developed based on the processes and historical development trends described above. these estimates are considered in conjunction with known facts and interpretations of circumstances and factors including our experience with similar cases, actual claims paid, historical trends involving claim payment patterns and pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs, product mix and contractual terms, changes in law and regulation, judicial decisions, and economic conditions. when we experience changes of the type previously mentioned, we may need to apply actuarial judgment in the determination and selection of development factors considered more reflective of the new trends, such as combining shorter or longer periods of historical results with current actual results to produce development factors based on two-year, three-year, or longer development periods to reestimate our reserves. for example, if a legal change is expected to have a significant impact on the development of claim severity for a coverage which is part of a particular line of insurance in a specific state, actuarial judgment is applied to determine appropriate development factors that will most accurately reflect the expected impact on that specific estimate. another example would be when a change in economic conditions is expected to affect the cost of repairs to damaged autos or property for a particular line, coverage, or state, actuarial judgment is applied to determine appropriate development factors to use in the reserve estimate that will most accurately reflect the expected impacts on severity development.
as claims are reported, for certain liability claims of sufficient size and complexity, the field adjusting staff establishes case reserve estimates of ultimate cost, based on their assessment of facts and circumstances related to each individual claim. for other claims which occur in large volumes and settle in a relatively short time frame, it is not practical or efficient to set case reserves for each claim, and a statistical case reserve is set for these claims based on estimation techniques described above. in the normal course of business, we may also supplement our claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters, appraisers, engineers, inspectors, and other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non-catastrophe related claims.
historically, the case reserves set by the field adjusting staff have not proven to be an entirely accurate estimate of the ultimate cost of claims. to provide for this, a development reserve is estimated using the processes described above, and allocated to pending claims as a supplement to case reserves. typically, the case, including statistical case, and supplemental development reserves comprise about 90% of total reserves.
another major component of reserves is ibnr. typically, ibnr comprises about 10% of total reserves. all major components of reserves are affected by changes in claim frequency as well as claim severity.
generally, the initial reserves for a new accident year are established based on actual claim frequency and severity assumptions for different business segments, lines and coverages based on historical relationships to relevant inflation indicators. reserves for
102
prior accident years are statistically determined using processes described above. changes in auto claim frequency may result from changes in mix of business, the rate of distracted driving, miles driven or other macroeconomic factors. changes in auto current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the medical and auto repair sectors of the economy and the effectiveness and efficiency of our claim practices. we mitigate these effects through various loss management programs. injury claims are affected largely by medical cost inflation while physical damage claims are affected largely by auto repair cost inflation and used car prices. for auto physical damage coverages, we monitor our rate of increase in average cost per claim against the maintenance and repair price index and the parts and equipment price index and other external indices. we believe our claim settlement initiatives, such as improvements to the claim review and settlement process, the use of special investigative units to detect fraud and handle suspect claims, litigation management and defense strategies, as well as various other loss management initiatives underway, contribute to the mitigation of injury and physical damage severity trends.
changes in homeowners current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the cost of building materials, the cost of construction and property repair services, the cost of replacing home furnishings and other contents, the types of claims that qualify for coverage, deductibles, other economic and environmental factors and the effectiveness and efficiency of our claim practices. we employ various loss management programs to mitigate the effect of these factors.
as loss experience for the current year develops for each type of loss, it is monitored relative to initial assumptions until it is judged to have sufficient statistical credibility. from that point in time and forward, reserves are reestimated using statistical actuarial processes to reflect the impact actual loss trends have on development factors incorporated into the actuarial estimation processes. statistical credibility is usually achieved by the end of the first calendar year; however, when trends for the current accident year exceed initial assumptions sooner, they are usually determined to be credible, and reserves are increased accordingly.
the very detailed processes for developing reserve estimates, and the lack of a need and existence of a common set of assumptions or development factors, limits aggregate reserve level testing for variability of data elements. however, by applying standard actuarial methods to consolidated historic accident year loss data for major loss types, comprising auto injury losses, auto physical damage losses and homeowner losses, we develop variability analyses consistent with the way we develop reserves by measuring the potential variability of development factors, as described in the section titled "potential reserve estimate variability" below.
causes of reserve estimate uncertainty since reserves are estimates of unpaid portions of claims and claims expenses that have occurred, including ibnr losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophe losses, requires regular reevaluation and refinement of estimates to determine our ultimate loss estimate.
at each reporting date, the highest degree of uncertainty in estimates for most of our losses arise from claims remaining to be settled for the current accident year and the most recent preceding accident year. the greatest degree of uncertainty exists in the current accident year because the current accident year contains the greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or settled but must be estimated as of the current reporting date. most of these losses relate to damaged property such as automobiles and homes, and medical care for injuries from accidents. during the first year after the end of an accident year, a large portion of the total losses for that accident year are settled. when accident year losses paid through the end of the first year following the initial accident year are incorporated into updated actuarial estimates, the trends inherent in the settlement of claims emerge more clearly. consequently, this is the point in time at which we tend to make our largest reestimates of losses for an accident year. after the second year, the losses that we pay for an accident year typically relate to claims that are more difficult to settle, such as those involving serious injuries or litigation. private passenger auto insurance provides a good illustration of the uncertainty of future loss estimates: our typical annual percentage payout of reserves remaining at december 31 for an accident year is approximately 45% in the first year after the end of the accident year, 20% in the second year, 15% in the third year, 10% in the fourth year, and the remaining 10% thereafter.
reserves for catastrophe losses property-liability claims and claims expense reserves also include reserves for catastrophe losses. catastrophe losses are an inherent risk of the property-liability insurance industry that have contributed, and will continue to contribute, to potentially material year-to-year fluctuations in our results of operations and financial position. we define a "catastrophe" as an event that produces pre-tax losses before reinsurance in excess of $1 million and involves multiple first party policyholders, or a winter weather event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset, per-event threshold of average claims in a specific area, occurring within a certain amount of time following the event. catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds, winter storms and freezes, tornadoes, hailstorms, wildfires, tropical storms, hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanoes. we are also exposed to man-made catastrophic events, such as certain types of terrorism or industrial accidents. the nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be reliably predicted.
the estimation of claims and claims expense reserves for catastrophe losses also comprises estimates of losses from reported claims and ibnr, primarily for damage to property. in general, our estimates for catastrophe reserves are based on claim adjuster inspections and the application of historical loss development factors as described above. however, depending on the nature of the catastrophe, the estimation process can be further complicated. for example, for hurricanes, complications could include the inability of insureds to promptly report losses, limitations placed on claims adjusting staff affecting their ability to inspect losses,
103
determining whether losses are covered by our homeowners policy (generally for damage caused by wind or wind driven rain) or specifically excluded coverage caused by flood, estimating additional living expenses, and assessing the impact of demand surge, exposure to mold damage, and the effects of numerous other considerations, including the timing of a catastrophe in relation to other events, such as at or near the end of a financial reporting period, which can affect the availability of information needed to estimate reserves for that reporting period. in these situations, we may need to adapt our practices to accommodate these circumstances in order to determine a best estimate of our losses from a catastrophe. as an example, in 2005 to complete an estimate for certain areas affected by hurricane katrina and not yet inspected by our claims adjusting staff, or where we believed our historical loss development factors were not predictive, we relied on analysis of actual claim notices received compared to total pif, as well as visual, governmental and third party information, including aerial photos, area observations, and data on wind speed and flood depth to the extent available.
potential reserve estimate variability the aggregation of numerous micro-level estimates for each business segment, line of insurance, major components of losses (such as coverages and perils), and major states or groups of states for reported losses and ibnr forms the reserve liability recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position. because of this detailed approach to developing our reserve estimates, there is not a single set of assumptions that determine our reserve estimates at the consolidated level. given the numerous micro-level estimates for reported losses and ibnr, management does not believe the processes that we follow will produce a statistically credible or reliable actuarial reserve range that would be meaningful. reserve estimates, by their very nature, are very complex to determine and subject to significant judgment, and do not represent an exact determination for each outstanding claim. accordingly, as actual claims, paid losses, and/or case reserve results emerge, our estimate of the ultimate cost to settle will be different than previously estimated.
to develop a statistical indication of potential reserve variability within reasonably likely possible outcomes, an actuarial technique (stochastic modeling) is applied to the countrywide consolidated data elements for paid losses and paid losses combined with case reserves separately for injury losses, auto physical damage losses, and homeowners losses excluding catastrophe losses. based on the combined historical variability of the development factors calculated for these data elements, an estimate of the standard error or standard deviation around these reserve estimates is calculated within each accident year for the last twenty years for each type of loss. the variability of these reserve estimates within one standard deviation of the mean (a measure of frequency of dispersion often viewed to be an acceptable level of accuracy) is believed by management to represent a reasonable and statistically probable measure of potential variability. based on our products and coverages, historical experience, the statistical credibility of our extensive data and stochastic modeling of actuarial chain ladder methodologies used to develop reserve estimates, we estimate that the potential variability of our allstate protection reserves, excluding reserves for catastrophe losses, within a reasonable probability of other possible outcomes, may be approximately plus or minus 4%, or plus or minus $500 million in net income applicable to common shareholders. a lower level of variability exists for auto injury losses, which comprise approximately 80% of reserves, due to their relatively stable development patterns over a longer duration of time required to settle claims. other types of losses, such as auto physical damage, homeowners losses and other personal lines losses, which comprise about 20% of reserves, tend to have greater variability but are settled in a much shorter period of time. although this evaluation reflects most reasonably likely outcomes, it is possible the final outcome may fall below or above these amounts. historical variability of reserve estimates is reported in the property-liability claims and claims expense reserves section of the md&a.
reserves for michigan and new jersey unlimited personal injury protection property-liability claims and claims expense reserves include reserves for michigan unlimited personal injury protection which is a mandatory coverage that provides unlimited personal injury protection to covered insureds involved in certain auto and motorcycle accidents. the administration of this program is through a private, non-profit association created by the state of michigan, the mcca. due to increasing costs of providing healthcare related to serious injuries and advances in medical care extending the duration of treatment, the estimation processes have been enhanced and assumptions for this reserve balance have been contemporized to the current validated conditions.
the comprehensive process employed to estimate mcca covered losses involves a number of activities including the comprehensive review and interpretation of mcca actuarial reports, other mcca members' reports and our personal injury protection loss trends which have increased in severity over time. we refined our ultimate claim reserve estimation techniques in 2011 through 2014, including relying more on paid loss development methods and increasing our view of future claim development and longevity of claimants, as a result of conducting comprehensive claim file reviews to develop case reserve type estimates of specific claims and other estimation refinements. in 2015, we updated the actuarial estimate of our ultimate reserves and recoverables. we report our paid and unpaid claims and case reserves, which include our best estimate of the ultimate claim cost, excluding ibnr to the mcca based on their requirements. the mcca does not provide participating companies with its estimate of a company's claim costs. we continue to update each comprehensive claim file case reserve estimate when there is a significant change in the status of the claimant, or once every three years if there have been no significant changes. a significant portion of incurred claim reserves can be attributed to a small number of catastrophic claims and thus a large portion of the recoverable is similarly concentrated.
we provide similar personal injury protection coverage in new jersey for auto policies issued or renewed in new jersey prior to 1991 that is administered by pliga. in 2013, we adopted similar actuarial estimating techniques as for the mcca exposures
104
to estimate loss reserves for unlimited personal injury protection coverage for policies covered by pliga. upon completion of our comprehensive review in 2014, we updated our reserve estimation techniques and factors, similar to the processes followed to develop the mcca reserves, which resulted in an increase in reserves for unlimited personal injury protection coverage for policies covered by the pliga. we continue to update our estimates for these claims as the status of claimants changes. however unlimited coverage was no longer offered after 1991, therefore no new claimants are being added.
reserve estimates by their nature are very complex to determine and subject to significant judgments, and do not represent an exact determination for each outstanding claim. claims may be subject to litigation. as actual claims, paid losses and/or case reserve results emerge, our estimate of the ultimate cost to settle may be materially greater or less than previously estimated amounts.
adequacy of reserve estimates we believe our net claims and claims expense reserves are appropriately established based on available methodologies, facts, technology, laws and regulations. we calculate and record a single best reserve estimate, in conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards, for each line of insurance, its components (coverages and perils) and state, for reported losses and for ibnr losses, and as a result we believe that no other estimate is better than our recorded amount. due to the uncertainties involved, the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts, which are based on our best estimates.
discontinued lines and coverages reserve estimates characteristics of discontinued lines exposure  our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises principally from assumed reinsurance coverage written during the 1960s through the mid-1980s, including reinsurance on primary insurance written on large u.s. companies, and from direct excess insurance written from 1972 through 1985, including substantial excess general liability coverages on large u.s. companies. additional exposure stems from direct primary commercial insurance written during the 1960s through the mid-1980s. asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by people who were exposed to asbestos or products containing asbestos. environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean-up costs. other discontinued lines exposures primarily relate to general liability and product liability mass tort claims, such as those for medical devices and other products, workers' compensation claims and claims for various other coverage exposures other than asbestos and environmental.
in 1986, the general liability policy form used by us and others in the property-liability industry was amended to introduce an "absolute pollution exclusion," which excluded coverage for environmental damage claims, and to add an asbestos exclusion. most general liability policies issued prior to 1987 contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage. general liability policies issued in 1987 and thereafter contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage and annual aggregate limits for all coverages. our experience to date is that these policy form changes have limited the extent of our exposure to environmental and asbestos claim risks.
our exposure to liability for asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines losses manifests differently depending on whether it arises from assumed reinsurance coverage, direct excess insurance or direct primary commercial insurance. the direct insurance coverage we provided that covered asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines was substantially "excess" in nature.
direct excess insurance and reinsurance involve coverage written by us for specific layers of protection above retentions and other insurance plans. the nature of excess coverage and reinsurance provided to other insurers limits our exposure to loss to specific layers of protection in excess of policyholder retention on primary insurance plans. our exposure is further limited by the significant reinsurance that we had purchased on our direct excess business.
our assumed reinsurance business involved writing generally small participations in other insurers' reinsurance programs. the reinsured losses in which we participate may be a proportion of all eligible losses or eligible losses in excess of defined retentions. the majority of our assumed reinsurance exposure, approximately 85%, is for excess of loss coverage, while the remaining 15% is for pro-rata coverage.
our direct primary commercial insurance business did not include coverage to large asbestos manufacturers. this business comprises a cross section of policyholders engaged in many diverse business sectors located throughout the country.
how reserve estimates are established and updated we conduct an annual review in the third quarter to evaluate and establish asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines reserves. changes to reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined. using established industry and actuarial best practices and assuming no change in the regulatory or economic environment, this detailed and comprehensive methodology determines asbestos reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure (i.e. claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non-products exposure) presented by individual policyholders, and determines environmental reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure (i.e. environmental damages, respective shares of liability of potentially responsible parties, appropriateness and cost of remediation) to pollution and related clean-up costs. the number and cost of these claims is affected by intense advertising by trial lawyers

seeking asbestos plaintiffs, and entities with asbestos exposure seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos liabilities, initially causing a delay in the reporting of claims, often followed by an acceleration and an increase in claims and claims expenses as settlements occur.
after evaluating our insureds' probable liabilities for asbestos and/or environmental claims, we evaluate our insureds' coverage programs for such claims. we consider our insureds' total available insurance coverage, including the coverage we issued. we also consider relevant judicial interpretations of policy language and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any.
evaluation of both the insureds' estimated liabilities and our exposure to the insureds depends heavily on an analysis of the relevant legal issues and litigation environment. this analysis is conducted by our specialized claims adjusting staff and legal counsel. based on these evaluations, case reserves are established by claims adjusting staff and actuarial analysis is employed to develop an ibnr reserve, which includes estimated potential reserve development and claims that have occurred but have not been reported. as of both december 31, 2015 and 2014, ibnr was 56.9% of combined net asbestos and environmental reserves.
for both asbestos and environmental reserves, we also evaluate our historical direct net loss and expense paid and incurred experience to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid and incurred activity.
other discontinued lines and coverages the following table shows reserves for other discontinued lines which provide for remaining loss and loss expense liabilities related to business no longer written by us, other than asbestos and environmental, as of december 31.

other mass torts describes direct excess and reinsurance general liability coverage provided for cumulative injury losses other than asbestos and environmental. workers' compensation and commercial and other include run-off from discontinued direct primary, direct excess and reinsurance commercial insurance operations of various coverage exposures other than asbestos and environmental. reserves are based on considerations similar to those described above, as they relate to the characteristics of specific individual coverage exposures.
potential reserve estimate variability establishing discontinued lines and coverages net loss reserves for asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims is subject to uncertainties that are much greater than those presented by other types of property-liability claims. among the complications are lack of historical data, long reporting delays, uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure and unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage; unresolved legal issues regarding the determination, availability and timing of exhaustion of policy limits; plaintiffs' evolving and expanding theories of liability; availability and collectability of recoveries from reinsurance; retrospectively determined premiums and other contractual agreements; estimates of the extent and timing of any contractual liability; the impact of bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants; and other uncertainties. there are also complex legal issues concerning the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are covered, or were ever intended to be covered, and could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. courts have reached different and sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage; what types of losses are covered; whether there is an insurer obligation to defend; how policy limits are determined; how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted; and whether clean-up costs represent insured property damage. our reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures could be affected by tort reform, class action litigation, and other potential legislation and judicial decisions. environmental exposures could also be affected by a change in the existing federal superfund law and similar state statutes. there can be no assurance that any reform legislation will be enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a fair, effective and cost-efficient system for settlement of asbestos or environmental claims. we believe these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future, and the ultimate costs may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded resulting in material changes in loss reserves. historical variability of reserve estimates is demonstrated in the property-liability claims and claims expense reserves section of the md&a.
adequacy of reserve estimates management believes its net loss reserves for environmental, asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws, regulations, and assessments of other pertinent factors and characteristics of exposure (i.e. claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non-products exposure) presented by individual policyholders, assuming no change in the legal, legislative or economic environment. due to the uncertainties and factors described above, management believes it is not practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such additional net loss reserves that may be required.

reserve for life-contingent contract benefits estimation due to the long term nature of traditional life insurance, life-contingent immediate annuities and voluntary accident and health insurance products, benefits are payable over many years; accordingly, the reserves are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid, reduced by the present value of future expected net premiums. long-term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields, mortality, morbidity, policy terminations and expenses are used when establishing the reserve for life-contingent contract benefits payable under these insurance policies. these assumptions, which for traditional life insurance are applied using the net level premium method, include provisions for adverse deviation and generally vary by characteristics such as type of coverage, year of issue and policy duration. future investment yield assumptions are determined based upon prevailing investment yields as well as estimated reinvestment yields. mortality, morbidity and policy termination assumptions are based on our experience and industry experience. expense assumptions include the estimated effects of inflation and expenses to be incurred beyond the premium-paying period. these assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued, are consistent with assumptions for determining dac amortization for these policies, and are generally not changed during the policy coverage period. however, if actual experience emerges in a manner that is significantly adverse relative to the original assumptions, adjustments to dac or reserves may be required resulting in a charge to earnings which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition.
we periodically review the adequacy of reserves and recoverability of dac for these policies on an aggregate basis using actual experience. in the event actual experience is significantly adverse compared to the original assumptions and a premium deficiency is determined to exist, any remaining unamortized dac balance must be expensed to the extent not recoverable and the establishment of a premium deficiency reserve may be required. in 2015, 2014 and 2013, our reviews concluded that no premium deficiency adjustments were necessary, primarily due to projected profit from traditional life insurance more than offsetting the projected losses in immediate annuities with life contingencies. in 2015 there was an increase in projected profit from traditional life insurance and an increase in projected losses in immediate annuities with life contingencies. we also review these policies on an aggregate basis for circumstances where projected profits would be recognized in early years followed by projected losses in later years. in 2015, 2014 and 2013, our reviews concluded that there were projected profits in each year of the projection period.
we will continue to monitor the experience of our traditional life insurance and immediate annuities. in 2015, we initiated a mortality study for our structured settlement annuities with life contingencies, which is expected to be completed in 2016. the study thus far indicates that annuitants may be living longer and receiving benefits for a longer period than originally estimated. the preliminary results of the study were considered in the premium deficiency and profits followed by losses evaluations described above. we anticipate that mortality, investment and reinvestment yields, and policy terminations are the factors that would be most likely to require premium deficiency adjustments to these reserves or related dac.
for further detail on the reserve for life-contingent contract benefits, see note 9 of the consolidated financial statements.
regulation and legal proceedings we are subject to extensive regulation and we are involved in various legal and regulatory actions, all of which have an effect on specific aspects of our business. for a detailed discussion of the legal and regulatory actions in which we are involved, see note 14 of the consolidated financial statements.
pending accounting standards there are several pending accounting standards that we have not implemented because the implementation date has not yet occurred. for a discussion of these pending standards, see note 2 of the consolidated financial statements.
the effect of implementing certain accounting standards on our financial results and financial condition is often based in part on market conditions at the time of implementation of the standard and other factors we are unable to determine prior to implementation. for this reason, we are sometimes unable to estimate the effect of certain pending accounting standards until the relevant authoritative body finalizes these standards or until we implement them.

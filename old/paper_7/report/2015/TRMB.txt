item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and those listed under "risks factors."
executive level overview trimble navigation limited is a leading provider of technology solutions that optimize the work processes of office and mobile field professionals around the world. our comprehensive work process solutions are used across a range of industries including agriculture, architecture, civil engineering, construction, environmental management, government, natural resources, transportation and utilities. representative trimble customers include engineering and construction firms, contractors, surveying companies, farmers and agricultural companies, enterprise firms with large-scale fleets, energy, mining and utility companies, and state, federal and municipal governments.
trimble focuses on integrating its broad technological and application capabilities to create vertically-focused, system-level solutions that transform how work is done within the industries we serve. the integration of sensors, software, connectivity, and information in our portfolio gives us the unique ability to provide an information model specific to the customer's workflow. for example, in construction our strategy is centered on the concept of a "constructible model," which will provide a real-time, connected, and cohesive information environment for the design, build, and operational phases of a project. in agriculture, we continue to develop "connected farm" solutions to optimize operations across the agriculture workflow. in transportation and logistics, we provide transportation companies with tools to enhance fuel efficiency, safety, and transparency across the enterprise.
our growth strategy is centered on multiple elements:
•   focus on attractive markets with significant growth and profitability potential - we focus on large markets historically underserved by technology that offer significant potential for long-term revenue growth, profitability and market leadership. our core industries such as construction, agriculture, and transportation markets are each multi-trillion dollar global industries which operate in increasingly demanding environments with technology adoption in the early phases relative to other industries. with the emergence of mobile computing capabilities, the increasing technological know-how of end users and the compelling return on investment to our customers, we believe many of our markets are ripe for substituting trimble's technology and solutions in place of traditional operating methods.
•   domain knowledge and technological innovation that benefit a diverse customer base - we have over time redefined our technological focus from hardware-driven point solutions to integrated work process solutions by developing domain expertise and heavily reinvesting in r&amp;d and acquisitions. we have been spending an average of 14% of revenue over the past several years on r&amp;d and currently have over 1,100 unique patents. we intend to continue to take advantage of our technology portfolio and deep domain knowledge to quickly and cost-effectively deliver specific, targeted solutions to each of the vertical markets we serve. we look for opportunities where the need for technological change is high and which have a requirement for the integration of multiple technologies into complete vertical solutions.
•   increasing focus on software and services - software and services are increasingly important elements of our solutions and are core to our growth strategy. trimble has an open application programming interface (api) philosophy and open vendor environment which leads to increased adoption of our software offerings. professional services constitute an additional growth channel that helps our customers integrate and optimize the use of our offerings in their environment. the increased recurring revenue from these solutions will provide us with enhanced business visibility over time.
•   geographic expansion with localization strategy - we view international expansion as an important element of our strategy and we continue to position ourselves in geographic markets that will serve as important sources of future growth. we currently have a physical presence in 43 countries and distribution channels in over 100 countries. in 2015, 50% of our sales were to customers located in countries outside of the u.s.
•   optimized distribution channels to best access our markets - we utilize vertically-focused distribution channels that leverage domain expertise to best serve the needs of individual markets domestically and abroad. these channels include independent dealers, joint ventures, original equipment manufacturers (oem) sales, and distribution alliances with key partners, such as cnh global, caterpillar, and nikon, as well as direct sales to end-users, that provide us with broad market reach and localization capabilities to effectively serve our markets.
•   strategic acquisitions - organic growth continues to be our primary focus, while acquisitions serve to enhance our market position. we acquire businesses that bring technology, products, or distribution capabilities that augment our portfolio and allow us to penetrate existing markets more effectively, or to establish a market beachhead. our level of success in targeting and effectively integrating acquisitions is an important aspect of our growth strategy.
32
trimble's focus on these growth drivers has led over time to growth in revenue and profitability as well as an increasingly diversified business model. software and services growth is driving increased recurring revenue, leading to improved visibility in our business. as our solutions have expanded, our go to market model has also evolved, with a balanced mix between direct, distribution and oem customers, and an increasing number of enterprise level customer relationships.
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. we consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting policies. these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or is uncertain, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met.
contracts and/or customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement. shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery. we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analyses, as well as the customer's payment history.
revenue for orders is not recognized until the product is shipped and title has transferred to the buyer. we bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point. our shipment terms for u.s. orders and international orders fulfilled from our european distribution center typically provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the carrier named by the buyer at the named place or point. if no precise point is indicated by the buyer, delivery is deemed to occur when the carrier takes the goods into its charge from the place determined by us. other shipment terms may provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the buyer. shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.
revenue from sales to distributors and dealers is recognized upon shipment, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. distributors and dealers do not have a right of return.
revenue from purchased extended warranty and post contract support (pcs) agreements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the warranty or support period. revenue from our subscription services related to our hardware and applications is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription service period beginning on the date that service is made available to the customer, assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been met.
we present revenue net of sales taxes and any similar assessments.
our software arrangements generally consist of a perpetual license fee and pcs. we generally have established vendor-specific objective evidence (vsoe) of fair value for our pcs contracts based on the renewal rate. the remaining value of the software arrangement is allocated to the license fee using the residual method. license revenue is primarily recognized when the software has been delivered and fair value has been established for all remaining undelivered elements. in cases where vsoe of fair value for pcs is not established, revenue is recognized ratably over the pcs period after all software deliverables have been made and the only the undelivered element is pcs.
for services performed on a fixed-fee basis, revenue is recognized using the proportional performance method, with performance measured based on hours of work performed. for contracts that involve significant customization and implementation or consulting services that are essential to the functionality of the software, the license and services revenues are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method or, if we are unable to reliably estimate the costs to complete the services, we use the completed-contract method of accounting.  a contract is considered complete when all significant costs have been incurred or when acceptance from the customer has been received.
some of our subscription product offerings include hardware, subscription services and extended warranty. under these hosted arrangements, the customer typically does not have the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the
33
hosting period without incurring a significant penalty and it is not feasible for the customer to run the software either on its own hardware or on a third-party's hardware.
our multiple deliverable product offerings include hardware with embedded firmware, extended warranty, software, pcs services and subscription services, which are considered separate units of accounting. for certain of our products, software and non-software components function together to deliver the tangible product's essential functionality.
in evaluating the revenue recognition for our hardware or subscription agreements which contain multiple deliverables, we determined that in certain instances we were not able to establish vsoe for some or all deliverables in an arrangement as we infrequently sold each element on a standalone basis, did not price products within a narrow range, or had a limited sales history. when vsoe cannot be established, we attempt to establish the selling price of each element based on relevant third-party evidence (tpe). tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. our offerings may contain a significant level of proprietary technology, customization or differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained. furthermore, we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products' selling prices are on a stand-alone basis. therefore, we typically are not able to establish the selling price of an element based on tpe.
when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe, we use our best estimate of selling price (besp) in our allocation of arrangement consideration. the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. besp is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, geographies and gross margin. the determination of besp is made through consultation with and formal approval by our management, taking into consideration our go-to-market strategy.
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized.
relative to uncertain tax positions, we only recognize a tax benefit if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual tax audit outcomes. determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment. changes in recognition or measurement of our uncertain tax positions would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. our practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
our valuation allowance is primarily attributable to foreign net operating losses and state research and development credit carryforwards. management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize these deferred tax assets, and, accordingly, a valuation allowance has been provided for such amounts. valuation allowance adjustments associated with an acquisition after the measurement period are recorded through income tax expense.
business combinations we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree based on their fair values at the acquisition date. the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill.
when determining the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins, customer attrition rates, future changes in technology and brand awareness, loyalty and position, and discount rates. fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period, which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available.
34
goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. intangible assets acquired individually, with a group of other assets, or in a business combination, are recorded at fair value. identifiable intangible assets are comprised of distribution channels and distribution rights, patents, licenses, technology, acquired backlog, trademarks, and in-process research and development.  the fair value of intangible assets acquired is generally determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line method, reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets, and have estimated useful lives ranging from one to twelve years with a weighted average useful life of 6.2 years. goodwill is not subject to amortization, but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment, applying a fair-value based test.
impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets we evaluate goodwill, at a minimum, on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. the annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year based on the values on the first day of that quarter. goodwill was reviewed for impairment utilizing a quantitative two-step process.  in the first step of this test, goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a discounted cash flow approach. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. in step two, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities. if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss. when we perform a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment, the determination of fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. the discounted cash flows are based upon, among other things, assumptions about expected future operating performance using risk-adjusted discount rates. actual future results may differ from those estimates. as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, the fair value for our reporting units ranged from 131% to approximately 701% of carrying amounts, therefore goodwill was not impaired and no further testing was required. for certain earlier stage reporting units, due to the smaller magnitude of the carrying value and fair value of each respective reporting unit, the margins by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value on an absolute dollar basis were relatively small.
depreciation and amortization of the intangible assets and other long-lived assets is provided using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets. changes in circumstances such as technological advances, changes to our business model, or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives of intangible assets or other long-lived assets differing from initial estimates. in cases where we determine that the useful life of an asset should be revised, the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value will be depreciated over its revised remaining useful life. these assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable based on their future cash flows. the estimated future cash flows are based upon, among other things, assumptions about expected future operating performance and these estimates may differ from actual future cash flows. the assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows (excluding interest) is less than the carrying value of the assets, the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value.
warranty costs the liability for product warranties was $18.5 million at the end of fiscal 2015, as compared with $20.6 million at the end of fiscal 2014. we accrue for warranty costs as part of cost of sales based on associated material product costs, technical support labor costs, and costs incurred by third parties performing work on our behalf. our expected future cost is primarily estimated based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment. when products sold include warranty provisions, they are covered by a warranty for periods ranging generally from 1 year to 2 years.
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage, and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. should actual product failure rates, material usage, or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be required.
stock-based compensation
35
we recognize compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors based on estimated fair values, net of estimated forfeitures. the grant date fair value for options is estimated using a binomial valuation model. the fair value of rights to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan is estimated using the black-scholes option-pricing model. the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. the fair value of restricted stock units with market-based vesting conditions is valued as of the grant date using a monte carlo simulation.
the determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rates, and any expected dividends. in addition, the binomial model incorporates actual option-pricing behavior and changes in volatility over the option's contractual term. the monte carlo simulation takes into account the same input assumptions as the binomial option pricing model as outlined above; however, it also incorporates into the fair-value determination the possibility that the market-based vesting conditions may not be satisfied and the impact of the possible differing stock price paths for trimble and each of the constituents of the s&p 500. if factors change and we employ different assumptions to determine the fair value of our share-based payment awards granted in future periods, the compensation expense that we record under it may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period.
stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. the stock-based compensation guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. if actual forfeitures different materially from our estimates, stock-based compensation recognized many not be reflective of what was earned in that period.
inventory valuation our inventories, net balance was $261.1 million at the end of fiscal 2015 as compared with $278.1 million at the end of fiscal 2014. our inventory allowances at the end of fiscal 2015 were $46.7 million, as compared with $41.1 million at the end of fiscal 2014. our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. adjustments are also made to reduce the cost of inventory for estimated excess or obsolete balances. factors influencing these adjustments include declines in demand which impact inventory purchasing forecasts, technological changes, product life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, physical deterioration and quality issues. if our estimates used to reserve for excess and obsolete inventory are different from what we expected, we may be required to recognize additional reserves, which would negatively impact our gross margin.

basis of presentation we have a 52-53 week fiscal year, ending on the friday nearest to december 31, which for fiscal 2015 was january 1, 2016. fiscal 2015 and 2014 were both 52-week years. fiscal 2013 was a 53-week year.
36
revenue in fiscal 2015, total revenue decreased by $105.1 million, or 4%, to $2.29 billion from $2.40 billion in fiscal 2014. overall revenue was primarily impacted by negative foreign currency effects, and to a lesser extent declines due to oil and gas and agricultural market conditions, partially offset by acquisitions and improved growth in building construction and transportation and logistics.
on a segment basis, the decrease in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to engineering and construction and field solutions, partially offset by the increase in mobile solutions. engineering and construction revenue decreased $64.8 million, or 5%, field solutions revenue decreased $66.8 million, or 16%, and advanced devices decreased $7.0 million, or 5%, partially offset by an increase in mobile solutions of $33.5 million, or 7%, as compared to fiscal 2014. the decline in engineering and construction was primarily driven by the impact of foreign currency effects due to the weaker euro and to a lesser extent, oil price declines on regional economies, primarily in geospatial. the decline was partially offset by building construction which was up due to organic growth and to a lesser extent, acquisitions not applicable in the prior year. the decline in field solutions revenue was primarily due to softness in agricultural markets and to a lesser extent, gis and foreign currency effects. mobile solutions revenue increased due to continued growth in the transportation and logistics market. advanced devices revenue decreased primarily due to weaker sales of timing component products.
by revenue category, overall product revenue decreased $180.1 million, or 11%, service revenue increased $23.9 million, or 6%, and subscription revenue increased $51.1 million, or 18%. the product revenue decrease was primarily within engineering and construction and field solutions, slightly offset by a product revenue increase in mobile solutions. service and subscription increases were primarily due to organic growth within engineering and construction and mobile solutions, as we continue to expand software and services, including implementation and maintenance, and subscription services as a portion of our revenue. although to a lesser extent, acquisitions growth within engineering and construction also contributed. we consider organic growth to include all revenue except for revenue associated with acquisitions made within the last four quarters.
in fiscal 2014, total revenue increased by $107.4 million, or 5%, to $2.40 billion from $2.29 billion in fiscal 2013. overall revenue was up due to growth in building construction, heavy civil, and transportation and logistics markets, partially offset by a decline in agricultural market conditions.
on a segment basis, the increase in fiscal 2014 was primarily due to engineering and construction and mobile solutions, and to a lesser extent advanced devices. engineering and construction revenue increased $126.1 million, or 10%, mobile solutions increased $21.7 million, or 5%, and advanced devices increased $11.4 million, or 9%, partially offset by a decrease in field solutions of $51.8 million, or 11%, as compared to fiscal 2013. revenue growth within engineering and construction was driven primarily by organic growth due to building construction, heavy civil, and to a lesser extent, geospatial products in the u.s. and europe. to a lesser extent, acquisitions contributed to the growth. mobile solutions revenue increased primarily due to organic growth in the transportation and logistics market. advanced devices revenue increased due to stronger sales of embedded and timing components. field solutions revenue decreased significantly primarily due to softness in agricultural markets.
by revenue category, overall product revenue increased $63.7 million, or 4%, service revenue increased $31.7 million, or 9%, and subscription revenue increased $12.0 million, or 4%. the product and service revenue increase in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was driven primarily by growth across engineering and construction and mobile solutions, which included organic growth, and to a lesser extent, the impact of acquisitions. product revenue growth was partially offset by a significant decrease in field solutions revenue primarily due to softness in agriculture. subscription growth was driven by growth in mobile solutions, partially offset by our change in accounting for virtual site solutions, our joint venture with caterpillar, which is now treated as an equity method investment. in the prior year, as a majority owner, we consolidated virtual site solutions results and virtual site solutions revenue was included in engineering and construction subscription revenue.
during fiscal 2015, sales to customers in the united states represented 50%, europe represented 24%, asia pacific represented 14%, and other regions represented 12% of our total revenue. during fiscal 2014, sales to customers in the united states represented 48%, europe represented 24%, asia pacific represented 14%, and other regions represented 14% of our total revenue. during fiscal 2013, sales to customers in the united states represented 49%, europe represented 23%, asia pacific represented 14%, and other regions represented 14% of our total revenue. we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue.
no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue in fiscal 2015, 2014 or 2013. no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our accounts receivable as of fiscal years ended 2015 and 2014.
gross margin our gross margin varies due to a number of factors including product mix, pricing, distribution channel, production volumes, new product start-up costs, and foreign currency translations.
37
in fiscal 2015, our gross margin decreased by $88.6 million as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to decreased revenue in engineering and construction and field solutions. gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 52.5% in fiscal 2015 and 53.9% in fiscal 2014. the decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily in engineering and construction due to product mix and foreign currency effects due to the weaker euro, and to a lesser extent, due to an increase in intangible asset amortization.
in fiscal 2014, our gross margin increased by $87.0 million as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the increase in total revenue. gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 53.9% in fiscal 2014 and 52.6% in fiscal 2013. the increase in the gross margin percentage was due to improved product mix in engineering and construction and mobile solutions, particularly software, software maintenance and subscription revenue. this was partially offset by higher amortization of purchased intangibles and lower gross margin in field solutions due to manufacturing underutilization.
operating income operating income decreased by $106.4 million for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2015 was 6.7% as compared to 10.9% for fiscal 2014. the decrease in operating income and operating income percentage was primarily due to revenue declines in engineering and construction and field solutions and increased restructuring, partially offset by the effects of operating expense control. also, higher revenue in mobile solutions partially offset the declines.
operating income increased by $9.1 million for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2014 was 10.9% as compared to 11.0% for fiscal 2013. the decrease in operating income and operating income percentage was primarily due to the revenue decrease in field solutions and the impact of acquisitions in engineering and construction in the fourth quarter of the year. the decrease was partially offset by gross margin improvements due to higher margin software, maintenance, and subscription revenue.
results by segment to achieve distribution, marketing, production, and technology advantages in our targeted markets, we manage our operations in the following four segments: engineering and construction, field solutions, mobile solutions, and advanced devices. segment operating income equals net revenue less cost of sales and operating expense, excluding general corporate expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related inventory step-up, acquisition costs and restructuring costs.

historically, we allocated stock-based compensation to each segment. beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we changed our methodology for allocating stock-based compensation to our segments. stock-based compensation is shown in the aggregate within unallocated corporate expense and is not reflected in the segment results, which is consistent with the way the chief operating decision maker (codm) evaluates each of the segment's performance and allocates resources. the change in the allocation of stock-based compensation is designed to help ensure that business segment results reflect how the codm makes decisions about resource allocations and assessing segment performance. we have adjusted the presentation of segment information for fiscal 2014 and 2013 to conform to the current year methodology. the following table shows the amount of stock-based compensation that had been previously allocated to the business segments in fiscal 2014 and 2013 and the impact to those segments' operating income.

engineering and construction engineering and construction revenue decreased by $64.8 million, or 5%, while segment operating income decreased by $65.3 million, or 23%, for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. the revenue decrease for fiscal 2015 was primarily driven by the negative foreign currency effects due to the weaker euro and to a lesser extent, the impact of oil price declines on regional economies which impacted sales, primarily in geospatial. to the extent these trends continue, our results of operations could be further impacted. the decline was partially offset by building construction which was up due to organic growth and acquisitions not applicable in the prior year.
segment operating income decreased primarily due to decreased revenue and lower gross margin resulting from product mix and foreign currency effects due to the weaker euro, slightly offset by the effects of operating expense control. although acquisitions contributed to revenue, they also presented a short term negative impact on revenue and operating income, partly because of deferred revenue accounting effects.
engineering and construction revenue increased by $126.1 million, or 10%, while segment operating income increased by $20.5 million, or 8%, for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. the revenue growth was primarily driven by organic growth in the global sales of building construction and heavy civil. the impact of acquisition revenue on the full year was relatively minor. sales were relatively strong in the u.s., particularly for building construction products and heavy civil products which continued to grow, however european markets demonstrated some slowness in growth. geospatial sales were relatively stable during the year, but slowed in the fourth quarter due to the impact of oil price declines.
segment operating income increased primarily due to higher revenue and a more favorable product mix, including higher margin software, service, and subscription revenue. this was partially offset by the impact of increased operating expenses due in part to the impact of acquisitions. although acquisitions contributed to revenue, they also presented a short term negative impact on revenue and operating income, partly because of deferred revenue accounting effects.
field solutions field solutions revenue decreased by $66.8 million, or 16%, while segment operating income decreased by $29.2 million, or 21%, for fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. the revenue decrease was primarily due to continued softness in agriculture markets, particularly in the oem channels, and to a lesser extent, gis and negative foreign currency effects due to the weaker euro. segment operating income decreased due to the revenue decrease described above, partially offset by the effects of operating expense control.
field solutions revenue decreased by $51.8 million, or 11%, while segment operating income decreased by $38.4 million, or 22%, for fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. the revenue decrease was primarily due to softness in agriculture markets where the market environment grew significantly more difficult in the last half of the year. the agriculture decrease was partially offset by a slight increase in geographic information system (gis) sales. segment operating income decreased primarily due to the revenue decrease in agriculture.
mobile solutions mobile solutions revenue increased by $33.5 million, or 7%, while segment operating income increased by $7.6 million, or 10% for fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. the revenue increase was primarily due to continued organic growth in the transportation and logistics market, which focuses on enterprise solutions. this was partially offset by a decline in field services

and negative foreign currency effects due to the weaker euro. segment operating income increased due to increased revenue and product mix, including higher software, maintenance and subscription revenue.
mobile solutions revenue increased by $21.7 million, or 5%, while segment operating income increased by $10.0 million, or 15% for fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. the revenue increase was primarily due to continued organic growth in the transportation and logistics market, which focuses on enterprise solutions. this was partially offset by a decline in field services as the focus shifts to more vertical markets. segment operating income increased due to increased revenue and product mix, including higher software, maintenance and subscription revenue, as well as product cost reductions.
advanced devices advanced devices revenue decreased by $7.0 million, or 5%, and segment operating income increased by $2.6 million, or 6%, for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. the decrease in revenue was primarily driven by decreased sales of timing component products, while the increase in operating income was due to gross margin expansion due to product mix and operating expense control.
advanced devices revenue increased by $11.4 million, or 9%, and segment operating income increased by $14.5 million, or 49%, for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. the increase in revenue and operating income was primarily driven by increased sales of timing and embedded component products as well as operating expense control.

income tax provision

our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were 20%, 20% and 14%, respectively.  the fiscal 2015 rate was less than the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the geographical mix of our pre-tax income and, to a lesser extent, the inclusion of the current year u.s. federal r&d credit. the fiscal 2014 rate was less than the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the geographical mix of our pre-tax income and, to a lesser extent, the inclusion of the current year u.s. federal r&d credit, partially offset by the effect of a gain on a partial equity sale of vss. the fiscal 2013 rate was less than the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the geographical mix of our pre-tax income and, to a lesser extent, the inclusion of the current year u.s. federal r&d credit, the favorable benefit of the retroactive reinstatement of the 2012 r&d credit and the benefit of the tax rate reduction in finland.
off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases, inventory purchases and other commitments incurred in the normal course of business (see contractual obligations table below), we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities, guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in transferred assets, or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. we do not have any majority-owned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements. additionally, we do not have any interest in, or relationship with, any special purpose entities.
in the normal course of business to facilitate sales of its products, we indemnify other parties, including customers, lessors, and parties to other transactions with us, with respect to certain matters. we have agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. these agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. in addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential exposure under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not been material and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the consolidated balance sheets at the end of fiscal 2015 and 2014.

cash and cash equivalents at the end of fiscal 2015, cash and cash equivalents totaled $116.0 million compared to $148.0 million at the end of fiscal 2014. we had a principal balance of outstanding debt of $735.2 million at the end of fiscal 2015 compared to $741.6 million at the end of fiscal 2014.
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, together with borrowings under our 2014 credit facility as described below under the heading "debt", will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, debt service, planned capital expenditures, acquisitions and stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program for at least the next twelve months.
we anticipate that planned capital expenditures primarily for enhancements of our oracle erp systems, computer equipment, software, manufacturing tools and test equipment and leasehold improvements associated with business expansion, will constitute

a partial use of our cash resources. decisions related to how much cash is used for investing are influenced by the expected amount of cash to be provided by operations.
operating activities cash provided by operating activities was $354.9 million for fiscal 2015, as compared to $407.1 million for fiscal 2014. the decrease of $52.2 million was due to a decrease in net income before non-cash depreciation and amortization primarily due to decreased operating income in engineering and construction and to a lesser extent, field solutions. this was partially offset by a decrease in working capital requirements, particularly for inventory.
cash provided by operating activities was $407.1 million for fiscal 2014, as compared to $414.6 million for fiscal 2013. the decrease of $7.5 million was due to a decrease in net income before non-cash depreciation and amortization, primarily due to decreased operating income in field solutions. this was partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue.
investing activities cash used in investing activities was $172.4 million for fiscal 2015, as compared to $344.0 million for fiscal 2014. the decrease is primarily due to cash used for business and intangible asset acquisitions. fiscal 2015 acquisitions included pocketmobile and vianova systems and other acquisitions. fiscal 2014 acquisitions included manhattan software, amtech and other acquisitions.
cash used in investing activities was $344.0 million for fiscal 2014, as compared to $324.8 million for fiscal 2013. the increase is primarily due to cash used for business and intangible asset acquisitions. fiscal 2014 acquisitions included manhattan software, amtech and other acquisitions. fiscal 2013 acquisitions included alk, trade services and other acquisitions.
financing activities cash used by financing activities was $202.8 million for fiscal 2015, as compared to cash used of $51.5 million during fiscal 2014. the increase of $151.3 million was primarily due to an increase in cash used for stock repurchases.
cash used by financing activities was $51.5 million for fiscal 2014, as compared to cash used of $98.4 million during fiscal 2013. the decrease of $46.9 million was primarily due to a decrease in debt proceeds, net of repayments, slightly offset by an increase in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock related to stock option exercises and stock repurchases.
accounts receivable and inventory metrics at the end of fiscal year                        2015        2014

inventory turns per year                     4.0          3.9
accounts receivable days sales outstanding were up at 59 days at the end of fiscal 2015, as compared to 58 days at the end of fiscal 2014, primarily due to the impact of acquisitions during the year. our accounts receivable days sales outstanding are calculated based on ending accounts receivable, net, divided by revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter, times a quarterly average of 91 days. our inventory turns were 4.0 at the end of fiscal 2015, as compared to 3.9 at the end of fiscal 2014. our inventory turnover is based on the total cost of sales for the fiscal period over the average inventory for the corresponding fiscal period.
debt notes on october 30, 2014, we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission ("sec") for the issuance of senior debt securities. on november 24, 2014, we issued $400.0 million of senior notes ("notes") under the shelf registration statement. the notes mature on december 1, 2024 and accrue interest at a rate of 4.75% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on december 1 and june 1 of each year, beginning on june 1, 2015. the notes are classified as long-term in the consolidated balance sheet.
prior to september 1, 2024, we may redeem the notes at our option at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest and principal, calculated on a semiannual basis using a discount rate equal to the u.s. treasury rate plus 40 basis points. after september 1, 2024, we may redeem the notes at our option at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. in addition, in the event of a change of control, as defined in the prospectus filed with the sec, each
44
holder of the notes will have the right to require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of such holder's notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.
in connection with the closing of the notes offering, we entered into an indenture with u.s. bank national association, as trustee. the indenture contains covenants limiting our ability to create certain liens, enter into sale and lease-back transactions, and consolidate or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person, each subject to certain exceptions. we were in compliance with these covenants at the end of fiscal 2015. the notes contain no financial covenants.
2014 credit facility on november 24, 2014, we entered into a new five-year credit agreement with a group of lenders (the "2014 credit facility"), which replaced our previous 2012 credit facility. the 2014 credit facility provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility of $1.0 billion. subject to the terms of the 2014 credit facility, the revolving loan facility may be increased and/or term loan facilities may be established in an amount up to $500.0 million. the outstanding balance of $216.0 million is classified as long-term in the consolidated balance sheet.
the funds available under the 2014 credit facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, stock repurchases and the financing of certain acquisitions. under the 2014 credit facility, we may borrow, repay and reborrow funds under the revolving loan facility until its maturity on november 24, 2019, at which time the revolving facility will terminate, and all outstanding loans, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, must be repaid. amounts not borrowed under the $1.0 billion revolving facility will be subject to a commitment fee, to be paid in arrears on the last day of each fiscal quarter, ranging from 0.10% to 0.30% per annum depending on either our credit rating at such time or our leverage ratio as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter, whichever results in more favorable pricing to us.
we may borrow funds under the 2014 credit facility in u.s. dollars, euros or in certain other agreed currencies, and borrowings will bear interest, at our option, at either: (i) a floating per annum base rate determined by reference to the highest of: (a) the administrative agent's prime rate; (b) 0.50% per annum above the federal funds effective rate; and (c) reserve-adjusted libor for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, plus a margin of between 0.00% and 0.75%, or (ii) a reserve-adjusted fixed per annum rate based on libor or euribor, depending on the currency borrowed, plus a margin of between 1.00% and 1.75%. the applicable margin in each case is determined based on either trimble's credit rating at such time or trimble's leverage ratio as of its most recently ended fiscal quarter, whichever results in more favorable pricing to us. interest is payable on the last day of each fiscal quarter with respect to borrowings bearing interest at the base rate, or on the last day of an interest period, but at least every three months, with respect to borrowings bearing interest at libor or euribor rate.
the 2014 credit facility contains various customary representations and warranties by us, which include customary use of materiality, material adverse effect and knowledge qualifiers. the 2014 credit facility also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including, among other requirements, negative covenants that restrict our ability to create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions, and that restrict our subsidiaries' ability to incur indebtedness. further, the 2014 credit facility contains financial covenants that require the maintenance of minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios. specifically, we must maintain as of the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of (a) ebitda (as defined in the 2014 credit facility) to (b) interest expense for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters of not less than 3.50 to 1.00. we must also maintain, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of (x) total indebtedness (as defined in the 2014 credit facility) to (y) ebitda (as defined in the 2014 credit facility) for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters of not greater than 3.00 to 1.00; provided, that on the completion of a material acquisition, we may increase the ratio by 0.50 for the fiscal quarter during which such acquisition occurred and each of the three subsequent fiscal quarters. we were in compliance with these covenants at the end of fiscal 2015.
the 2014 credit facility contains events of default that include, among others, non-payment of principal, interest or fees, breach of covenants, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, cross defaults to certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, material judgments and events constituting a change of control. upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, interest on the obligations will accrue at an increased rate and the lenders may accelerate our obligations under the 2014 credit facility, except that acceleration will be automatic in the case of bankruptcy and insolvency events of default.
the interest rate on the long-term debt outstanding under the credit facilities was 1.46% and 1.42% at the end of fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively.
uncommitted facilities we also have two $75 million revolving credit facilities which are uncommitted (the "uncommitted facilities"). the uncommitted facilities may be called by the lenders at any time, have no covenants and no specified expiration date. the interest rate on the uncommitted facilities is 1.00% plus either libor or the bank's cost of funds or as otherwise agreed upon by the bank and us.
45
the $118.0 million outstanding at the end of 2015 and the $57.0 million outstanding at the end of 2014 under the uncommitted facilities are classified as short-term in our consolidated balance sheet. the weighted average interest rate on the uncommitted facilities was 1.37% at the end of fiscal 2015 and 1.15% at the end of fiscal 2014.
for additional discussion of our debt, see note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.
repatriation of foreign earnings and income taxes at the end of fiscal 2015, $95.6 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $29.0 million was borrowed from the u.s. under intercompany financing arrangements. if these loaned funds are needed for our operations in the u.s., we would not be required to accrue and pay u.s. federal and state taxes to repatriate the loaned funds.  we expect that over the next two quarters these intercompany financing arrangements will be repaid and after such repayment, we would be required to pay u.s. federal and state taxes upon any repatriation of remaining cash held by our foreign subsidiaries.  while a significant portion of our foreign earnings continue to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries, it is anticipated this reinvestment will not impede cash needs at the parent company level. however, if we were to make significant acquisitions or stock repurchases, we may be required to increase our outstanding indebtedness, which could result in increased borrowing costs. in our determination of which foreign earnings are permanently reinvested, we consider numerous factors, including the financial requirements of the u.s. parent company, the financial requirements of the foreign subsidiaries, and the tax consequences of remitting the foreign earnings back to the u.s. there are no other material impediments to our ability to access sources of liquidity and our resulting ability to meet short and long-term liquidity needs, other than in the event we are not in compliance with the covenants under our 2014 credit facility or the potential tax costs of remitting foreign earnings back to the u.s.

(1)   amount represents principal payments over the life of the debt obligations. (see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further financial information regarding debt.)
(2)   amount represents the expected interest payments relating to our debt. our $400.0 million notes accrue interest at 4.75% per annum and are payable semi-annually in arrears on december 1 and june 1 each year. interest on our credit facilities and uncommitted facilities was estimated to be 1.46% and 1.37% per annum, respectively, based upon recent trends and is payable at least quarterly.
(3)   other purchase obligations and commitments primarily represent open non-cancelable purchase orders for material purchases with our vendors, and also include estimated payments due for acquisition related earn-outs and holdbacks. purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.
at the end of fiscal 2015 we had unrecognized tax benefits (included in other non-current liabilities) of $53.1 million, including interest and penalties. at this time, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with tax authorities regarding this liability, and therefore, such amounts are not included in the contractual obligations table above.
effect of new accounting pronouncements the impact of recent accounting pronouncements is disclosed in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.

reconciliation of gaap to non-gaap financial measures our non-gaap measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap measures. the non-gaap financial measures included in the following tables as well as detailed explanations to the adjustments to comparable gaap measures, are set forth below:
non-gaap gross margin we believe our investors benefit by understanding our non-gaap gross margin as a way of understanding how product mix, pricing decisions and manufacturing costs influence our business. non-gaap gross margin excludes restructuring costs, amortization of purchased intangible assets, stock-based compensation and amortization of acquisition-related inventory step-up from gaap gross margin. we believe that these exclusions offer investors additional information that may be useful to view trends in our gross margin performance.
non-gaap operating expenses we believe this measure is important to investors evaluating our non-gaap spending in relation to revenue. non-gaap operating expenses exclude restructuring costs, amortization of purchased intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition/divestiture costs associated with external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities such as legal, due diligence, integration costs and litigation expense from gaap operating expenses. we believe that these exclusions offer investors supplemental information to facilitate comparison of our operating expenses to our prior results.
non-gaap operating income we believe our investors benefit by understanding our non-gaap operating income trends which are driven by revenue, gross margin, and spending. non-gaap operating income excludes restructuring costs, amortization of purchased intangible assets, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related inventory step-up, acquisition/divestiture costs associated with external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities such as legal, due diligence, integration costs, and litigation expenses. we believe that these exclusions offer an alternative means for our investors to evaluate current operating performance compared to results of other periods.
non-gaap non-operating income (expense), net we believe this measure helps investors evaluate our non-operating income trends. non-gaap non-operating income (expense), net excludes acquisition and divestiture gains/losses associated with unusual acquisition related items such as intangible asset impairment charges and gains or losses related to the acquisition or sale of certain businesses and investments, and an equity sale gain. these gains/losses are specific to particular acquisitions and divestitures and vary significantly in amount and timing. non-gaap non-operating income (expense), net also excludes debt issuance cost write-offs associated with terminated and/or modified credit facilities and costs associated with the issuance of new credit facilities and senior notes that were not capitalized as debt issuance costs. we believe that these exclusions provide investors with a supplemental view of our ongoing financial results.
non-gaap income tax provision we believe that providing investors with the non-gaap income tax provision is beneficial because it provides for consistent treatment of the excluded items in our non-gaap presentation. in fiscal 2015 we began calculating a non-gaap tax rate separate from the gaap rate as we expect this to add consistency in the non-gaap trends. the non-gaap income tax provision excludes material non-recurring items such as build and release of valuation allowances, reserve releases related to closure of tax audits, and other non-recurring items. we have not retroactively restated prior periods' non-gaap results with a similar separate rate. therefore, comparability between periods may be affected.
non-gaap net income this measure provides a supplemental view of net income trends which are driven by non-gaap income before taxes and our non-gaap tax rate. non-gaap net income excludes restructuring costs, amortization of purchased intangible assets, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related inventory step-up, acquisition and divestiture costs, litigation, an equity sale gain, debt issuance cost write-offs and non-gaap tax adjustments from gaap net income. we believe our investors benefit from understanding these exclusions and from an alternative view of our net income performance as compared to our past net income performance.
non-gaap diluted net income per share
47
we believe our investors benefit by understanding our non-gaap operating performance as reflected in a per share calculation as a way of measuring non-gaap operating performance by ownership in the company. non-gaap diluted net income per share excludes restructuring costs, amortization of purchased intangible assets, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related inventory step-up, acquisition and divestiture costs, litigation, an equity sale gain, debt issuance cost write-offs and non-gaap tax adjustments from gaap diluted net income per share. we believe that these exclusions offer investors a useful view of our diluted net income per share as compared to our past diluted net income per share.
non-gaap operating leverage we believe this information is beneficial to investors as a measure of how much incremental revenue contributed to our operating income. non-gaap operating leverage is the increase in non-gaap operating income as a percentage of the increase in revenue. we believe that this information offers investors supplemental information to evaluate our current performance and to compare to our past non-gaap operating leverage.
these non-gaap measures can be used to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance, as well as our performance relative to competitors. we believe some of our investors track our ""core operating performance"" as a means of evaluating our performance in the ordinary, ongoing, and customary course of our operations. core operating performance excludes items that are non-cash, not expected to recur or not reflective of ongoing financial results. management also believes that looking at our core operating performance provides a supplemental way to provide consistency in period to period comparisons. accordingly, management excludes from non-gaap those items relating to restructuring, amortization of purchased intangible assets, stock based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related inventory step-up, acquisition and divestiture items, litigation, a gain on an equity sale, write-off of debt issuance costs and non-gaap tax adjustments. for detailed explanations of the adjustments made to comparable gaap measures, see items (a) - ( m) below, fiscal years

a.   restructuring costs. included in our gaap presentation of cost of sales and operating expenses, restructuring costs recorded are primarily for employee compensation resulting from reductions in employee headcount in connection with our company restructurings. we exclude restructuring costs from our non-gaap measures because we believe they do not reflect expected future operating expenses, they are not indicative of our core operating performance, and they are not meaningful in comparisons to our past operating performance. we have incurred restructuring expense in each of the last three years. however the amount incurred can vary significantly based on whether a restructuring has occurred in the period and the timing of headcount reductions.
b.   amortization of purchased intangible assets. included in our gaap presentation of gross margin and operating expenses is amortization of purchased intangible assets. us gaap accounting requires that intangible assets are recorded at fair value and amortized over their useful lives. consequently, the timing and size of our acquisitions will cause our operating results to vary from period to period, making a comparison to past performance difficult for investors. this accounting treatment may cause differences when comparing our results to companies that grow internally because the fair value assigned to the intangible assets acquired through acquisition may significantly exceed the equivalent expenses that a company may incur for similar efforts when performed internally. furthermore, the useful life that we expense our intangible assets over may be substantially different from the time period that an internal growth company incurs and recognizes such expenses. we believe that by excluding the amortization of purchased intangible assets, which primarily represents technology and/or customer relationships already developed, it provides an alternative way for investors to compare our operations pre-acquisition to those post-acquisitions and to those of our competitors that have pursued internal growth strategies. however, we note that companies that grow internally will incur costs to develop intangible assets that will be expensed in the period incurred, which may make a direct comparison more difficult.
c.   stock-based compensation. included in our gaap presentation of cost of sales and operating expenses, stock-based compensation consists of expenses for employee stock options and awards and purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan. we exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-gaap measures because some investors may view it as not reflective of our core operating performance as it is a non-cash expense. for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, stock-based compensation was allocated as follows:

d.   amortization of acquisition-related inventory step-up. the purchase accounting entries associated with our business acquisitions require us to record inventory at its fair value, which is sometimes greater than the previous book value of the inventory. included in our gaap presentation of cost of sales, the increase in inventory value is amortized to cost of sales over the period that the related product is sold. we exclude inventory step-up amortization from our non-gaap measures because it is a non-cash expense that we do not believe is indicative of our ongoing operating results. we further believe that excluding this item from our non-gaap results is useful to investors in that it allows for period-over-period comparability.
e.   acquisition / divestiture items. included in our gaap presentation of operating expenses, acquisition costs consist of external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition and strategic investment activities such as legal, due diligence, as well as adjustments to the fair value of our earn-out liabilities. included in our gaap presentation of non-operating income, net, acquisition / divestiture items includes unusual acquisition, investment, or divestiture gains/losses. although we do numerous acquisitions, the costs that have been excluded from the non-gaap measures are costs specific to particular acquisitions. these are one-time costs that vary significantly in amount and timing and are not indicative of our core operating performance.
f.   litigation. these amounts represents costs accrued to settle litigation, generally as a result of an arbitration agreement. the fiscal 2014 amount includes $51.3 million of estimated costs that were reserved during the third quarter based on a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff, recreational data services, inc. and then reversed during the fourth quarter after the judge overturned the verdict. we have excluded these costs from our non-gaap measures because they are non-recurring

expenses that are not indicative of our ongoing operating results. we further believe that excluding these items from our non-gaap results is useful to investors in that it allows for period-over-period comparability.
g.   gain on an equity sale. included in our gaap presentation of non-operating income (expense), net this amount represents a gain on a partial equity sale of virtual site solutions. we excluded the gain from our non-gaap measures. we believe that investors benefit from excluding this item from our non-gaap measures because it facilitates an evaluation of our non-operating income trends.
h.   debt issuance cost write-off. included in our gaap non-operating income, net this amount represents a write-off of debt issuance costs for terminated and/or modified credit facilities and costs associated with the issuance of new credit facilities and senior notes in fiscal 2014 that were not capitalized as debt issuance costs. we excluded the debt issuance cost write-off from our non-gaap measures. we believe that investors benefit from excluding this item from our non-operating income to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our non-operating income trends.
i.   non-gaap items tax effected. this amount adjusts the provision for income taxes to reflect the effect of the non-gaap items ( a ) - ( h ) on non-gaap net income. we believe this information is useful to investors because it provides for consistent treatment of the excluded items in this non-gaap presentation.
j.   difference in gaap and non-gaap tax rate. this amount represents the difference between the gaap and non-gaap tax rates applied to the non-gaap operating income plus the non-gaap non-operating income (expense), net. in fiscal 2015 we began calculating a non-gaap tax rate separate from the gaap rate as we expect this to add consistency in the quarterly trends. the non-gaap income tax provision excludes material non-recurring items such as build and release of valuation allowances, reserve releases related to closure of tax audits, and other non-recurring items. we have not retroactively restated prior periods with a similar separate rate. therefore, comparability between periods may be affected.
k.   tax on gain on an equity sale. this amount represents the tax effect of a gain on a partial equity sale of virtual site solutions. we excluded this item as it represents the tax effect of a non-recurring gain. we believe that investors benefit from excluding this item from our non-gaap income tax provision because it facilitates a comparison of the non-gaap tax rate in 2014 to the non-gaap tax rates in the current and prior periods.
l.   gaap and non-gaap tax rate %. these percentages are defined as gaap income tax provision as a percentage of gaap income before taxes and non-gaap income tax provision as a percentage of non-gaap income before taxes. we believe that investors benefit from a presentation of non-gaap tax rate percentage as a way of facilitating a comparison to non-gaap tax rates in prior periods. however, this comparability may be impacted since we began separately calculating a non-gaap tax rate in fiscal 2015.
non-gaap operating income non-gaap operating income decreased by $89.9 million for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, and increased by $6.0 million for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. non-gaap operating income as a percentage of total revenue was 17.0%, 20.0%, and 20.7% for fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
the non-gaap operating income and non-gaap operating income percentage for fiscal 2015 decreased primarily due to revenue declines in engineering and construction and field solutions, partially offset by a revenue increase in mobile solutions. the increase in non-gaap operating income for 2014 was primarily due to a revenue increase in engineering and construction and mobile solutions, partially offset by revenue decrease in field solutions and the impact of acquisitions in engineering and construction. the decrease of non-gaap operating income percentage for 2014 was primarily due to a revenue decrease in field solutions and the impact of acquisitions in engineering and construction.

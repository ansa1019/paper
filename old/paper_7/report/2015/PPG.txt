2015 vs. 2014
net sales decreased $30 million due to the following:
● unfavorable foreign currency translation (7%)
partially offset by:
● net sales from acquired businesses (6%)
● higher sales volumes (1%)
foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted net sales by $1.1 billion as the u.s. dollar strengthened against most foreign currencies versus the prior year.
acquired businesses added $941 million of sales in 2015, primarily consorcio comex s.a. de c.v. ("comex"), supplemented by several other smaller acquisitions made in 2014 and 2015. in november 2015, comex reached its one year anniversary and its net sales and income are reported as organic growth subsequent to its anniversary date.
sales volume growth occurred primarily in the emerging regions and emea, while north america sales volumes declined less than 1%.
2014 vs. 2013
net sales increased $1.1 billion (8%) due to the following:
● sales from acquired businesses (4%)
● higher sales volumes (3%)
● higher selling prices (1%)
sales volume growth was fairly consistent across all regions, advancing 3.5% overall.
the sales volume growth was led by a 4.3% improvement in the u.s. and canada. asia-pacific sales volumes also grew 3.9% and latin america sales volumes grew 3.5% year-over-year. sales for emea grew 2.4%, with growth primarily occurring in the first half of the year.
acquired businesses added about $600 million of sales in 2014, primarily due to the first quarter 2014 sales of the north american architectural coatings business acquired in april 2013, as well as two months of comex sales.

interest expense, net of interest income interest expense, net of interest income decreased $51 million in 2015 versus the prior year largely as a result of a debt refinancing undertaken in the fourth quarter of 2014.
business restructuring in 2015, ppg approved a business restructuring program which includes actions necessary to achieve cost synergies related to recent acquisitions. in addition, the program aims to further align employee levels and production capacity in certain businesses and regions based on current product demand, as well as reductions in various global administrative functions. a pre-tax restructuring charge of $140 million was recorded, of which about 85% represents employee severance and other cash charges. ppg expects these restructuring actions will result in full year, pre-tax savings of approximately $105 million by year 2017, including 2015 partial year savings of approximately $20 million. refer to note 7, "business restructuring" in item 8 of this form 10-k for additional information.
in 2013, the company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $98 million related to a restructuring plan focused on achieving cost synergies through improved productivity and efficiencies. all actions associated with the 2013 restructuring program are completed.
debt refinancing in 2014, the company recorded a pre-tax charge of $317 million representing costs related to a debt refinancing undertaken to lower the company's future interest costs. the charge consists of an aggregate make-whole cash premium of $179 million for the redemption of public notes, an aggregate cash premium of $43 million for debt redeemed through a tender offer, a realization of net unamortized losses of $89 million on interest rate swaps and forward starting swaps, and a balance of unamortized fees and discounts of $6 million related to the debt redeemed. refer to note 8, "borrowings and lines of credit" in item 8 of this form 10-k for additional information.
other charges the company recorded pre-tax environmental charges for the environmental remediation at a former chromium manufacturing plant and associated sites in new jersey of $136 million and $89 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
other charges in 2015 and 2013 were lower than 2014 due to the timing and amount of these pre-tax environmental charges.
other income in 2014, ppg recorded a $22 million pre-tax gain on the divestiture of a flat glass production facility and a $94 million pre-tax gain on ppg's share of the gain recognized from the sale of an equity affiliate's business.
other income in 2015 and 2013 was lower than 2014 due to the absence of these benefits. further, in 2015 other income was reduced by an equity affiliate debt refinancing transaction charge of $11 million.

*see the regulation g reconciliation.
the effective tax rate for the year-ended december 31, 2015 was affected by a shift in ppg's global mix of earnings toward jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates, due in part to recent acquisitions, including comex.
earnings per diluted share for the year ended december 31, 2015 grew consecutively from 2014 and 2013. the company benefited from the 11.5 million shares of stock repurchased in 2013, the 7.6 million shares of stock repurchased during 2014 and the 7.0 million shares repurchased in 2015.
in addition, about 21.6 million shares were added to treasury stock as a result of the january 2013 exchange transaction that was part of the separation of ppg's former commodity chemicals business.
on april 16, 2015, the ppg board of directors approved a 2-for-1 split of the company's common stock for all shareholders. the record date for the split was the close of business on may 11, 2015, and the additional shares were distributed on june 12, 2015. each shareholder as of the date of record received one additional share of common stock for each share held. historical per share and share data (except for shares on the balance sheet) in this form 10-k give retroactive effect to the stock split. these reclassifications had no impact on our previously reported net income, total assets, cash flows or shareholders' equity.
20 2015 ppg annual report and form 10-k regulation g reconciliation - results from operations ppg industries believes investors' understanding of the company's operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of net income, earnings per diluted share and the effective tax rate adjusted for nonrecurring charges. ppg's management considers this information useful in providing insight into the company's ongoing operating performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on a quarterly basis. net income and earnings per diluted share adjusted for these items are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) and should not be considered a substitute for net income or earnings per diluted share or other financial measures as computed in accordance with u.s. gaap. in addition, adjusted net income, earnings per diluted share and the effective tax rate may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies.
income before income taxes is reconciled to adjusted income before income taxes, the effective tax rate from continuing operations is reconciled to the adjusted effective tax rate from continuing operations and net income (attributable to ppg) and earnings per share - assuming dilution (attributable to ppg) are reconciled to adjusted net income (attributable to ppg) and adjusted earnings per share - assuming dilution below:

2015 vs. 2014
performance coatings net sales increased (1%) due to the following:
● net sales from acquisitions (9%), largely comex
● selling prices were modestly higher partially offset by:
● unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately $700 million (8%)
● lower sales volumes (1%)
architectural coatings - emea sales volumes declined 1%. demand was inconsistent throughout the region with modest growth continuing in certain countries, including the u.k., while several other countries experienced lower demand, including france.
protective and marine coatings net sales volumes were slightly higher year-over-year. sales for the business increased due to acquisition-related sales synergies from the comex acquisition offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation.
organic sales growth continued in aerospace coatings, aided by increased end-use market demand, but moderated versus the prior period reflecting the strong growth the business has delivered the past several years. automotive refinish coatings sales volume growth was higher, with solid growth trends in the u.s. and canada.
excluding the impacts of acquisitions and currency, architectural coatings - americas and asia pacific net sales were lower versus 2014. the year-over-year sales comparison was negatively impacted in the u.s. and canada by several new ppg product pipeline fills at major customers in the previous year, as well as customer inventory management by most u.s. and canadian retail customers and independent dealers at the end of a modest paint season. organic sales growth in the recently acquired comex architectural coatings business was a high-single-digit percentage, but was partially mitigated by unfavorable foreign currency translation caused by the impact of a weaker mexican peso versus the u.s. dollar.
segment income increased $97 million (8%) primarily due to acquisitions, lower manufacturing costs and modestly higher selling prices, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and lower sales volumes.
2014 vs. 2013
performance coatings net sales increased (10%) due to the following:
● net sales from acquisitions (8%), which included the 2013 acquisition of a north american architectural coatings business and comex
● selling prices increased modestly
● sales volumes, excluding acquisitions, advanced nearly 2% across all major regions partially offset by:
● unfavorable currency translation of $60 million architectural coatings-emea sales volumes improved by low-single digit percentages year-over-year aided by partial demand recovery in some regions and in comparison to strengthening prior year levels. sales volume improvement occurred early in the year, aided by favorable weather conditions, which was partially offset by lower year-over-year sales volumes late in the year.
the protective and marine coatings business experienced modest sales improvement, driven primarily by sales volume increases in the north american and european protective markets. marine new-build sales volumes were negative early in the year, but positive late in the year.
the aerospace coatings and automotive refinish businesses both delivered slightly higher sales volumes year-over-year in each major region. demand trends in the overall aerospace industry continued to remain favorable globally. automotive refinish coatings sales growth was supported by higher emerging region activity and solid growth in the developed regions, including benefits from the expansion of the vehicle parc in asia, higher north american demand and a partial demand recovery in europe.
excluding the impacts of acquisitions and currency, architectural coatings, america and asia pacific, net sales were up modestly year over year.
segment income increased $162 million (16%) primarily due to the increase in organic net sales and acquisitions, including the further realization of cost synergies, partially offset by cost inflation.
looking ahead in the first quarter of 2016, we expect recently completed acquisitions to add $25 million to $30 million to net sales. we also expect sales volume growth to continue in the architectural coatings - emea business in the first quarter of 2016; although, we expect results to vary by country. in addition, the protective and marine coatings business is expected to deliver modest year-over-year volume growth in the first quarter 2016. for the aerospace coatings business, we anticipate sales volume performance to be in line with industry rates as customer order patterns return to normal levels. in our architectural coatings americas and asia pacific business, we are implementing various initiatives in our north american "do it yourself" business, consistent with ppg's multi-year rebranding strategy announced in 2015. these initiatives include investments in new product labeling and improved store displays, along with associated growth-oriented initiatives, which will result in incremental costs of approximately $15 million. additionally, based on current exchange rates, we expect foreign currency translation on segment sales and income to be less unfavorable sequentially versus the fourth quarter of 2015 and year-over-year as the euro and other major currencies weakened during 2015.

2015 vs. 2014
industrial coatings segment net sales decreased (1%) due to the following:
● unfavorable foreign currency translation of nearly $400 million (8%)
● lower sales prices (1%)
partially offset by:
● net sales from acquired businesses (4%)
● higher sales volumes (3%), with growth in all regions, led by asia-pacific and emea ppg's global automotive oem coatings business achieved sales volume growth in all regions, with an aggregate business unit growth rate of a high-mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year in comparison with the global auto industry production growth rate of approximately 2%. ppg sales volume growth was led by strong european and asian demand. ppg continues to benefit from the adoption of new technologies and ongoing focus on customer service and customer process improvement initiatives.
sales volumes declined modestly in ppg's general industrial coatings and specialty coatings and materials businesses in comparison to strong volume growth in the prior year period. demand was mixed across various end-use markets and regions.
global packaging coatings sales volumes were up a high-mid-single-digit percentage, aided by new product introductions and continued emerging region growth.
segment income increased $34 million (4%) primarily due to lower manufacturing costs, higher sales volumes and acquisitions, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation.
2014 vs. 2013
industrial coatings segment net sales increased (6%) due to the following:
● sales volume growth (6%) in all regions, led by north america ppg's global automotive oem business grew net sales by a high-single-digit percentage year-over-year and continued a multi-quarter trend of outperforming global industry growth.
growth accelerated in the industrial coatings business, aided by continued north american and emerging region strength, and european demand remained positive year-over-year.
specialty coatings and materials net sales grew year-over-year aided by higher sales volumes in oled materials, optical materials, precipitated silicas and teslin substrate.
packaging coatings year-over-year net sales were lower, reflecting continued weakness in europe.
segment income increased $127 million (15%) primarily due to the benefit from sales volume growth and lower manufacturing costs as a result of our continued focus on increased productivity and efficiency.
looking ahead in the first quarter of 2016, we expect recently completed acquisitions to add between $80 million and $90 million to net sales. we expect modest automotive industry production growth worldwide in the first quarter of 2016, with growth in all regions except south america. for the packaging coatings business, we expect a continued industry shift toward bpa non-intent (bpa-ni) products on the inside of food and beverage cans globally, resulting in sustained ppg sales volume growth in early 2016. overall, we expect modest general industrial sales volume growth to continue, but to likely remain varied by region and industrial sub-sector. additionally, based on current exchange rates, we expect foreign currency translation on segment sales and income to be less unfavorable sequentially versus the fourth quarter of 2015 and year-over-year as the euro and other major currencies weakened during 2015.

2015 vs. 2014
glass segment net sales decreased (2%) due to the following:
● lower sales stemming from a 2014 flat glass production facility divestiture (5%)
● unfavorable foreign currency translation (4%)
partially offset by:
● higher selling prices (4%)
● higher sales volumes (3%)
flat glass organic sales grew modestly year-over-year aided by continued strong non-residential construction demand and improved pricing. additionally, product mix was favorable from higher value-added and specialty glass stemming from end-use market growth coupled with an internal product mix shift related to the 2014 facility divestiture. fiber glass sales volumes increased a low-single-digit percentage in the u.s. market. selling prices improved modestly year-over-year in the u.s. and europe.
segment income increased $56 million (69%) due to favorable flat glass product mix and lower manufacturing costs stemming from the reduction in ppg's system-wide flat glass capacity. segment income was partially offset by weak manufacturing cost performance related to challenges at the fresno, ca flat glass facility. the facility was subject to a force majeure in the third quarter of 2015 due to manufacturing issues and is undergoing a major repair commencing in the first quarter of 2016. segment income was also unfavorably impacted by higher pension costs.
2014 vs. 2013
glass segment net sales increased (4%) due to the following:
● higher selling prices (2%)
● higher sales volumes (3%)
partially offset by:
● unfavorable foreign currency translation (1%)
sales volumes in flat glass reflect improvements in residential and non-residential end-use market demand, partly offset by unfavorable currency translation, primarily the canadian dollar. fiber glass sales volumes were higher year over year led by europe, partly offset by declines in the u.s.
segment income increased $25 million (45%) due to lower manufacturing costs and the increase in organic sales partially offset by higher costs stemming from scheduled maintenance projects. higher natural gas-based energy costs early in the year were also a negative factor, although this impact declined later in the year.
looking ahead in the first quarter of 2016, we expect a relatively stable industry demand environment for the flat glass business, with lower ppg sales due to the fresno facility maintenance outage. the maintenance expenses associated with the fresno repair project are expected to be approximately $8 million. we anticipate fiber glass demand to be in line with the prior year. additionally, based on current exchange rates, we expect foreign currency translation on segment sales and income to be less unfavorable sequentially versus the fourth quarter of 2015 and year-over-year as the euro and other major currencies weakened during 2015.
24 2015 ppg annual report and form 10-k review and outlook during 2015, overall economic conditions remained mixed among the major global economies and across the various end-use markets ppg supplies. despite the uneven overall market conditions, ppg's aggregate sales volumes grew about 1%. in addition to the organic growth, acquisitions, led by comex, contributed significantly to the company sales, adding about 6% to net sales. these net sales additions were offset by 7% unfavorable foreign currency translation as the u.s. dollar strengthened versus most major foreign currencies.
the u.s. and canada remained ppg's largest region representing 46% of 2015 sales. during 2015, industrial activity was mixed by end-use market and by country, with modestly positive trends in the u.s., and lower demand in canada largely due to lower commodity and energy prices. certain consumer-facing industries, like automotive oem, continued to expand. these gains were driven by lower unemployment rates and rising consumer disposable income, partly related to lower energy prices.
in addition to overall market gains, ppg's leading products continued to gain broader market acceptance. consistent with previous years, ppg automotive oem coatings continued to outpace regional industry growth. in packaging coatings, ppg's new interior can coatings contributed to above-market end-use growth rates, and ppg's waterborne refinish coatings, continued to be a major factor in new customer adoption within the region.
construction spending in the region continued to recover in a measured manner, building on the recovery in recent years. u.s. housing starts grew over 10% during the year and were supplemented by continued improvement in the residential remodeling market. non-residential construction demand recovered as well, although the results were mixed across the different u.s. regions. although smaller in size, canadian construction market demand declined as regional gross domestic product (gdp) in the country was negative for a large portion of the year reflecting the impact from falling global energy prices, which is an important element of the canadian economy.
european economic activity continued to modestly strengthen and broaden throughout the year. in general, economic factors, including gdp and industrial production, improved within the region. demand remained mixed by country as some european countries experienced relatively strong growth rates while others were flat or declined. regional demand for ppg products also strengthened throughout the year, with first quarter year-over-year sales volumes growing one percent, and performance steadily improving during the year ending with about 3% growth in the fourth quarter. demand for ppg's products in several end-use markets aided ppg's overall regional growth rate, including automotive oem and refinish coatings, aerospace coatings, and protective and marine coatings.
europe remains a very large region for ppg, representing just under 30% of ppg's 2015 sales, down slightly versus the prior year due to the impact of lower currency exchange rates and the addition of acquisition-related sales in other ppg regions. company coatings sales volumes in the region are still down about 17%, or just under $900 million, when compared to 2008 pre-recession levels, reflecting economic weakness in the years during and following the recession, without a substantive recovery since. from a currency perspective, the euro and other currencies in the region weakened considerably against the u.s. dollar, resulting in unfavorable currency translation for the company.
the emerging market regions of asia and latin america represented 26% of ppg's 2015 sales versus 22% in 2014. this expansion was primarily due to the comex acquisition that was completed in november 2014. in the aggregate, emerging region economies continued to expand during 2015, but at a lower rate than the previous year. within the emerging regions, growth rates varied considerably by country. ppg sales volume growth of 4% in asia was partly offset by a decline of less than 1% in latin america.
asia was the largest emerging region with sales of about $2.4 billion, led by china which remained ppg's second largest individual country from a sales perspective in 2015. the largest gains in asia were in the industrial coatings segment, including the benefit of 5% industry growth in chinese automotive production. offsetting these improvements was muted demand in several general industrial end-use markets, including heavy-duty equipment and construction-related metal products. in addition to the industrial coatings gains, protective and marine coatings, aerospace coatings, and other businesses experienced increased sales volumes.
demand in the latin american economies was bifurcated, with economic growth continuing in mexico, aided by increased industrial production. this was partly offset by economic contraction in south america, particularly in brazil, due to high inflation and unemployment rates. also, weakening south american currencies versus the u.s. dollar were unfavorable to ppg net sales.
looking ahead to 2016, we anticipate ppg volume growth rates to improve in each region and in aggregate versus the prior year. we expect broadening growth to continue in europe, including a continuation of demand growth in automotive oem and packaging coatings. we expect moderate growth trends to remain in most end-use markets in the u.s, with canada stabilizing at lower demand levels. we anticipate emerging regions growth to remain mixed, but for ppg to post solid aggregate growth based on the specific end-use markets and countries that the company supplies.
in november 2014, ppg completed the acquisition of comex, mexico's leading architectural coatings company. the company targeted $45 million to $50 million in annual savings from business synergies. throughout 2015, ppg executed actions to capture these synergies and achieved the targeted annual run-rate savings. in addition to cost synergies, the company expects to realize $40 million to $50 million of annual revenue synergies related to the sale of legacy ppg products through comex's distribution network. also anticipated are other additional annual revenue synergies of $60 million to $70 million in central america by 2019.
during 2015, ppg announced a $140 million corporate restructuring program, with anticipated annual savings of about $105 million once fully implemented. the impact and expected cost saving encompass all major regions and most business units. the company achieved approximately $20 million (pre-tax) in restructuring-related savings in 2015 and expects to recognize an incremental $60 million to $70 million in additional restructuring savings in 2016. we expect substantially all 2015 restructuring actions to be completed in 2016. ppg

remains aggressive with respect to cost management, and will continually monitor the company's cost structure relative to projected regional and end use-market demand levels. the company will proactively make adjustments to its cost structure as appropriate.
raw materials are a significant input cost in the manufacture of coatings. ppg typically experiences fluctuating prices for energy and raw materials driven by various factors, including supply and demand imbalances, global industrial activity levels, changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories, and foreign currency exchange rates. given the recent volatility in certain energy-based input costs and foreign currencies, the company is not able to predict with certainty the 2016 full year impact of related changes in raw material pricing. also, given the distribution nature of many of our businesses, logistics and distribution costs are sizable, as are wages and benefits to a lesser degree. in aggregate, raw material feedstock prices in 2015 were lower, including oil-related products. since oil is traded in u.s. dollars globally, the strengthening of the dollar against a wide variety of foreign currencies muted some of the oil-related benefits in certain regions, and in certain cases resulted in inflationary raw material prices.
pension and postretirement benefit costs, excluding curtailments and special termination benefits, were $173 million in 2015, up $50 million from $123 million in 2014. this change was principally due to a change in the mortality rates utilized to estimate the pension costs. in 2016, the company will change the method it uses to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefit costs for substantially all of its u.s. and foreign plans. historically, the service and interest cost components were estimated using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. the company has elected to use a full yield curve approach ("split-rate") to estimate these components of benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. the company will make this change to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs. this change does not affect the measurement of the company's total benefit obligations. the company will account for this change as a change in estimate and, accordingly, will recognize its effect prospectively beginning in fiscal year 2016. we expect 2016 defined benefit expense to decrease by approximately $20 million to $25 million. during 2015, ppg's cash contributions to defined benefit pension plans totaled $289 million. total cash contributions to global defined benefit pension plans were $41 million and $174 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. we expect to make mandatory contributions to our non-u.s. plans in the range of $35 million to $40 million in 2016. we may also make voluntary contributions to our u.s. pension plans in 2016 and beyond.
in aggregate, the company selling prices were flat in 2015 reflecting employee-related cost inflation, with energy-related cost inputs providing an offset. while selective pricing actions are currently planned in 2016, the company expects flat aggregate pricing again in 2016.
a variety of foreign currencies weakened throughout 2015 versus the u.s. dollar. for 2015, foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted sales by $1.1 billion and pre-tax income by about $120 million. based on mid-january 2016 exchange rates, the company expects year-over-year currency translation to unfavorably impact 2016 sales by $550 million to $600 million, and 2016 pre-tax income by about $70 million to $80 million. since mid-january, certain foreign currencies have strengthened versus the u.s. dollar, as the foreign currency environment continues to be volatile. thus, the foreign currency impact on 2016 net sales and pre-tax income could differ from the mid-january guidance. the company generally purchases raw materials, incurs manufacturing costs and sells finished products in the same currency, so it typically incurs modest transactional-related currency impacts to earnings.
the company expects interest expense, net of interest income in 2016 to be approximately $20 million higher than 2015 due to debt issuances during 2015. we also expect somewhat lower interest income in 2016.
we expect our adjusted effective tax rate from continuing operations to be in the range of 24.5% to 25.5% in 2016. this rate is slightly higher than the equivalent 2015 rate primarily due to a shift in the mix of earnings to jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates. other factors may impact the 2016 tax rate positively or negatively throughout the year, including changes to various tax regulations around the world.
over the past five years, the company has used $3.5 billion of cash to repurchase about 49 million shares of stock. the company ended the year with approximately $920 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization. during 2015, the company deployed over $400 million for acquisitions (purchase price) and nearly $400 million for dividends. ppg increased its annual per-share dividend by 7% in 2015, marking the 44th annual increase and the 116th consecutive year of dividend payments. in january 2015, the company announced a cash deployment target for acquisitions and share repurchases of between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion for years 2015 and 2016 combined. the company adjusted this range in september 2015 to reflect the year-to-date pace of cash deployment to between $2.0 billion and $2.5 billion. the company expects continued strong free cash generation in 2016.
accounting standards adopted in 2015
note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies," under item 8 of this form 10-k describes the company's recently adopted accounting pronouncements.
accounting standards to be adopted in future years note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies," under item 8 of this form 10-k describes accounting pronouncements that have been promulgated prior to december 31, 2015 but are not effective until a future date.
26 2015 ppg annual report and form 10-k commitments and contingent liabilities, including environmental matters ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. see item 3, "legal proceedings" and note 13, "commitments and contingent liabilities," under item 8 of this form 10-k for a description of certain of these lawsuits, including a description of the proposed asbestos settlement.
as discussed in item 3 and note 13, although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable, management believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg, including asbestos-related claims in the event the proposed asbestos settlement described in note 13 does not become effective, will not have a material effect on ppg's consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized.
it is ppg's policy to accrue expenses for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted. in management's opinion, the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the company's environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on ppg's financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. management anticipates that the resolution of the company's environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time.
the company continues to analyze, assess and remediate the environmental issues associated with ppg's former chromium manufacturing plant in jersey city, n.j. and associated sites ("new jersey chrome"). information will continue to be generated from the ongoing groundwater remedial investigation activities related to new jersey chrome and will be incorporated into a final draft remedial action work plan for groundwater expected to be submitted to the new jersey department of environmental protection no later than 2020.
there are multiple, future events yet to occur, including further remedy selection and design, remedy implementation and execution and applicable governmental agency or community organization approvals. considerable uncertainty exists regarding the timing of these future events for the new jersey chrome sites. final resolution of these events is expected to occur over the next several years. as these events occur and to the extent that the cost estimates of the environmental remediation remedies change, the existing reserve for this environmental remediation matter will be adjusted.
liquidity and capital resources during the past three years, ppg has had sufficient financial resources to meet its operating requirements, to fund our capital spending, including acquisitions, share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to shareholders.

operating working capital operating working capital is a subset of total working capital and represents (1) receivables from customers, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, (2) inventories, and (3) trade liabilities. see note 3, "working capital detail" under item 8 of this form 10-k for further information related to the components of the company's operating working capital. we believe operating working capital represents the key components of working capital under the operating control of our businesses. operating working capital at december 31, 2015 and 2014 was $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively.
a key metric we use to measure our working capital management is operating working capital as a percentage of sales (fourth quarter sales annualized).

cash outlays related to environmental remediation were $109 million, $165 million, and $111 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we expect cash outlays in 2016 to be between $40 million and $60 million.

(4)   we have recorded an obligation equal to the net present value of the aggregate cash payments, along with the ppg stock and other assets to be contributed to a trust under the proposed asbestos settlement. however, ppg has no obligation to pay any amounts under this settlement until the funding effective date, as more fully discussed in note 13, "commitments and contingent liabilities," under item 8 of this form 10-k.
in january 2016, all pending appeals of the pittsburgh corning plan of reorganization were withdrawn. under the plan, ppg and its participating insurers will make initial contributions to the asbestos trust established by the plan within 30 business days after the plan becomes effective and all conditions to funding have been met. ppg anticipates that those conditions to funding will be satisfied and funding will take place in the first half of 2016. refer to note 13, "commitments and contingent liabilities" under item 8 of this form 10-k for additional information.
other liquidity matters at december 31, 2015, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits, was approximately $90 million. the timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities. ppg does not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year. the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur.
the company has $5.0 billion of undistributed earnings of non-u.s. subsidiaries as of december 31, 2015 and 2014.  these amounts relate to approximately 225 subsidiaries in more than 60 taxable jurisdictions. as discussed in note 2, "acquisitions and dispositions," ppg recorded a deferred u.s. income tax liability on the foreign earnings generated from the sale of its transitions optical joint venture in 2014. at december 31, 2015 and 2014, the expected future tax cost to repatriate these earnings totaled $142 million and $247 million, respectively. no significant deferred u.s. income taxes have been provided on the remaining $4.2 billion of ppg's undistributed earnings as they are considered to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time or will be repatriated when it is tax effective to do so. the company estimates repatriation of undistributed earnings of non-u.s. subsidiaries as of december 31, 2015 and 2014 would have resulted in a u.s. tax cost of approximately $375 million and $200 million, respectively.
off-balance sheet arrangements the company's off-balance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase commitments disclosed in the "liquidity and capital resources" section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in note 8, "borrowings and lines of credit," under item 8 of this form 10-k.
critical accounting estimates management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes
2015 ppg annual report and form 10-k 29
presented under item 8 of this form 10-k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. we believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies, under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, and to accounting for pensions, other postretirement benefits, business combinations, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies.
contingencies contingencies, by their nature, relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss. the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectability of accounts receivable, to environmental remediation, to pending, impending or overtly threatened litigation against the company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years. for more information on these matters, see note 3, "working capital detail," note 11, "income taxes" and note 13, "commitments and contingent liabilities" under item 8 of this form 10-k.
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works. to accomplish this, we make extensive use of assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, turnover, medical costs and discount rates. the company has established a process by which management reviews and selects these assumptions annually. see note 12, "employee benefit plans," under item 8 for information on these plans and the assumptions used.
business combinations in accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations, the company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. the excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized as goodwill. the valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results. in addition to using management estimates and negotiated amounts, the company uses a variety of information sources to determine the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including: third-party appraisals for the estimated value and lives of identifiable intangible assets and property, plant and equipment; third-party actuaries for the estimated obligations of defined benefit pension plans and similar benefit obligations; and legal counsel or other experts to assess the obligations associated with legal, environmental and other contingent liabilities. the business and technical judgment of management was used in determining which intangible assets have indefinite lives and in determining the useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets.
goodwill and intangible assets the company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment annually by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of a reporting unit or asset is less than its carrying amount. fair values under the quantitative test are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows. for more information on these matters, see note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies," under item 8 of this form 10-k.
we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under item 8 of this form 10-k related to these contingencies, pensions, other postretirement benefits, business combinations, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management, although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates.
currency throughout 2015 and the last six months of 2014, the u.s. dollar strengthened over prior year comparable periods against the currencies in most countries in which ppg operates, most notably the euro and the mexican peso. as a result, consolidated net assets at december 31, 2015 and 2014 decreased by $704 million and $623 million, respectively.
comparing exchange rates during 2015 to those of 2014, in the countries in which ppg operates, the u.s. dollar was stronger overall, which had an unfavorable impact on full year 2015 income before income taxes from the translation of these foreign earnings into u.s. dollars of approximately $120 million.
comparing exchange rates during 2014 to those of 2013, in the countries in which ppg operates, the u.s. dollar was weaker overall, which had an immaterial favorable impact on full year 2014 income before income taxes from the translation of these foreign earnings into u.s. dollars.
forward-looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. management's discussion and analysis and other sections of this annual report contain forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views with respect to future events and financial performance.
you can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to current or historic facts. forward-looking statements are identified by the use of the words "aim," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "project," "outlook," "forecast" and other expressions that indicate future events and trends. any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. you are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the securities and exchange commission. also, note the following cautionary statements.
many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company's forward-looking statements. such factors include global economic conditions, increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors,
30 2015 ppg annual report and form 10-k fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, the timing of and the realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring initiatives, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom, economic and political conditions in international markets, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, fluctuations in tax rates, the impact of future legislation, the impact of environmental regulations, unexpected business disruptions and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation, including litigation that could result if the proposed asbestos settlement does not become effective. however, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.
consequently, while the list of factors presented here and under item 1a is considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements.
consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, lower sales or earnings, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties, other factors set forth in item 1a of this form 10-k and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

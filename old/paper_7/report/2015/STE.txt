item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction in management's discussion and analysis ("md&a"), we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for steris and its subsidiaries including:
•   what factors affect our business;
•   what our earnings and costs were;
•   why those earnings and costs were different from the year before;
•   where our earnings came from;
•   how this affects our overall financial condition;
•   what our expenditures for capital projects were; and
•   where cash will come from to fund future debt principal repayments, growth outside of core operations, repurchase ordinary shares, pay cash dividends and fund future working capital needs.
the md&a also analyzes and explains the annual changes in the specific line items in the consolidated statements of income. as you read the md&a, it may be helpful to refer to information in item 1, "business," item 6, "selected financial data," and our consolidated financial statements, which present the results of our operations for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, as well as part i, item 1a, "risk factors" and note 11 of our consolidated financial statements titled, "commitments and contingencies" for a discussion of some of the matters that can adversely affect our business and results of operations. this information, discussion, and disclosure may be important to you in making decisions about your investments in steris.
financial measures in the following sections of the md&a, we may, at times, refer to financial measures that are not required to be presented in the consolidated financial statements under u.s. gaap. we sometimes use the following financial measures in the context of this report: backlog; debt-to-total capital; net debt-to-total capital; and days sales outstanding. we define these financial measures as follows:
•   backlog - we define backlog as the amount of unfilled capital equipment purchase orders at a point in time. we use this figure as a measure to assist in the projection of short-term financial results and inventory requirements.
•   debt-to-total capital - we define debt-to-total capital as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and shareholders' equity. we use this figure as a financial liquidity measure to gauge our ability to borrow and fund growth.
•   net debt-to-total capital - we define net debt-to-total capital as total debt less cash ("net debt") divided by the sum of net debt and shareholders' equity. we also use this figure as a financial liquidity measure to gauge our ability to borrow and fund growth.
•   days sales outstanding ("dso") - we define dso as the average collection period for accounts receivable. it is calculated as net accounts receivable divided by the trailing four quarters' revenues, multiplied by 365 days. we use this figure to help gauge the quality of accounts receivable and expected time to collect.
we, at times, may also refer to financial measures which are considered to be "non-gaap financial measures" under sec rules. we have presented these financial measures because we believe that meaningful analysis of our financial performance is enhanced by an understanding of certain additional factors underlying that performance. these financial measures should not be considered an alternative to measures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. our calculations of these measures may differ from calculations of similar measures used by other companies and you should be careful when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. additional information regarding these financial measures, including reconciliations of each non- gaap financial measure, is available in the subsection of md&a titled, "non-gaap financial measures."
revenues- defined as required by regulation s-x, we separately present revenues generated as either product revenues or service revenues on our consolidated statements of income for each period presented. when we discuss revenues, we may, at times, refer to revenues summarized differently than the regulation s-x requirements. the terminology, definitions, and applications of terms
27
that we use to describe revenues may be different from terms used by other companies. we use the following terms to describe revenues:
•   revenues - our revenues are presented net of sales returns and allowances.
•   product revenues - we define product revenues as revenues generated from sales of consumable and capital equipment products.
•   service revenues - we define service revenues as revenues generated from parts and labor associated with the maintenance, repair, and installation of our capital equipment. service revenues also include hospital sterilization services, instrument and scope repairs, and linen management as well as revenues generated from contract sterilization and laboratory services offered through our applied sterilization technologies segment.
•   capital revenues - we define capital revenues as revenues generated from sales of capital equipment, which includes steam sterilizers, low temperature liquid chemical sterilant processing systems, including system 1 and 1e, washing systems, vhp® technology, water stills, and pure steam generators; surgical lights and tables; and integrated or.
•   consumable revenues - we define consumable revenues as revenues generated from sales of the consumable family of products, which includes system 1 and 1e consumables, v-pro consumables, gastrointestinal endoscopy accessories, sterility assurance products, skin care products, cleaning consumables, and surgical instruments.
•   recurring revenues - we define recurring revenues as revenues generated from sales of consumable products and service revenues.
general overview and executive summary our business. steris plc, a public limited company organized under the laws of england and wales, was incorporated on october 9, 2014 as a private limited company under the name new steris limited and was re-registered effective november 2, 2015 as a public limited company under the name steris plc. new steris limited was established to effect the combination ("combination") of steris corporation, an ohio corporation ("old steris"), and synergy health plc, a public limited company organized under the laws of england and wales ("synergy"). the combination closed on november 2, 2015 and as a result steris plc became the ultimate parent company of old steris and steris completed the acquisition of synergy in a cash and stock transaction. synergy has been re-registered under the name synergy health limited. the combination was accounted for in the consolidated financial statements as a merger between entities under common control; accordingly the historical consolidated financial statements of old steris for periods prior to november 2, 2015, are considered to be the historical financial statements of steris plc.
due to the timing of the closing of the combination, the results of synergy are only reflected in the results of operations of the company from november 2, 2015 forward, which will affect comparability to the prior period historical operations of the company throughout this annual report on form 10-k.
as a result of the combination, we have reorganized our operations into four reportable business segments: healthcare products, healthcare specialty services, life sciences, and applied sterilization technologies. we describe our business segments in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements, titled "business segment information."
our mission is to help our customers create a healthier and safer world by providing innovative healthcare and life science product and service solutions around the globe. our dedicated employees around the world work together to supply a broad range of solutions by offering a combination of capital equipment, consumables, and services to healthcare, pharmaceutical, industrial, and governmental customers.
the bulk of our revenues are derived from the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. much of the growth in these industries is driven by the aging of the population throughout the world, as an increasing number of individuals are entering their prime healthcare consumption years, and is dependent upon advancement in healthcare delivery, acceptance of new technologies, government policies, and general economic conditions. the pharmaceutical industry has been impacted by increased fda scrutiny of cleaning and validation processes, mandating that manufacturers improve their processes. within healthcare, there is increased concern regarding the level of hospital acquired infections around the world; increased demand for medical procedures, including preventive screenings such as endoscopies and colonoscopies; and a desire by our customers to operate more efficiently, all which are driving increased demand for many of our products and services.
we also are pursuing a strategy of expanding into adjacent markets with acquisitions in the healthcare products, healthcare specialty services and life sciences segments. on july 31, 2015 we acquired all of the outstanding shares of general econopak, inc. ("gepco"), a pennsylvania-based manufacturer of consumable product solutions in the areas of sterility maintenance, barrier protection, and sterile cleanroom products for pharmaceutical, biotechnology and veterinary customers. on june 12, 2015 we acquired the capital stock of black diamond video, inc. ("black diamond"), a california-based developer and provider of operating room integration systems. we also completed several other minor purchases that continued to expand our service offerings in the healthcare products, healthcare specialty services and life sciences segments.
28
we continue to invest in manufacturing in-sourcing projects for the purpose of improving quality, cost and delivery of our products to our customers.
highlights.  revenues increased $388.5 million, or 21.0%, to $2,238.8 million for the year ended march 31, 2016, as compared to $1,850.3 million for the year ended march 31, 2015, reflecting growth within all four business segments and the combination with synergy.
fiscal 2016 operating income decreased 6.3% to $212.9 million over the fiscal 2015 operating income of $227.2 million. contributing to this decrease were additional acquisition costs related to our combination with synergy of $50.1 million, in fiscal 2016 over fiscal 2015. in addition, we incurred $26.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 in connection with a settlement of a legacy pension obligation (see note 10 to our financial statements titled ,"benefit plans" for more information).
net cash flows from operations were $254.7 million and free cash flow was $129.1 million in fiscal 2016 compared to net cash flows from operations of $246.0 and free cash flow of $161.6 in fiscal 2015, (see subsection of md&a titled, "non-gaap financial measures" for additional information and related reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap measures). cash flow from operations and free cash flow were negatively impacted by expenses related to the combination with synergy and other acquisitions. in addition, the amount paid in fiscal 2016 in connection with our annual compensation program was higher than the amount paid in fiscal 2015 and a pension contribution was made in connection with the settlement of a legacy pension obligation (see note 8 to our financial statements titled,"benefit plans" for more information on the pension obligation settlement). free cash flow was further impacted by an increase in purchases of property, plant, equipment and intangibles. our debt-to-total capital ratio was 34.2% at march 31, 2016. we increased our quarterly dividend for the tenth consecutive year to $0.25 per share per quarter.
outlook. fluctuations in foreign currency rates can impact revenues and costs outside of the united states, creating variability in our results for fiscal 2016 and beyond.
in fiscal 2017 and beyond, we expect to continue to manage our costs, grow our business with internal product and service development, invest in greater capacity, and augment these value creating methods with acquisitions of adjacent products and services. we plan to continue our efforts to in-source some of the production that we have traditionally out-sourced.
matters affecting comparability international operations. through our subsidiaries, we operate in various international locations. fluctuations in the exchange rate of our reporting currency, the u.s. dollar, relative to the currencies of other countries in which we operate can increase or decrease our reported net assets and results of operations. during fiscal 2016, our revenues were unfavorably impacted by $41.9 million, or 1.8%, and income before taxes was favorably impacted by $20.4 million, or 13.6%, as a result of foreign currency movements relative to the u.s. dollar.
non-gaap financial measures we, at times, refer to financial measures which are considered to be "non-gaap financial measures" under sec rules. we, at times, also refer to our results of operations excluding certain transactions or amounts that are non-recurring or are not indicative of future results, in order to provide meaningful comparisons between the periods presented.
these non-gaap financial measures are not intended to be, and should not be, considered separately from or as an alternative to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures.
these non-gaap financial measures are presented with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the board of directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. these amounts are disclosed so that the reader has the same financial data that management uses with the belief that it will assist investors and other readers in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our operations for the periods presented.
we believe that the presentation of these non-gaap financial measures, when considered along with our gaap financial measures and the reconciliation to the corresponding gaap financial measures, provide the reader with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. it is important for the reader to note that the non-gaap financial measure used may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, a similarly titled measure used by other companies.
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows less purchases of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant, equipment,
29
and intangibles, which are also presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows. we use this as a measure to gauge our ability to fund future debt principal repayments and growth outside of core operations, repurchase shares, and pay cash dividends. the following table summarizes the calculation of our free cash flow for the years ended march 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:

revenues increased $388.5 million, or 21.0%, to $2,238.8 million for the year ended march 31, 2016, as compared to $1,850.3 million for the year ended march 31, 2015. this increase is attributable to the combination, along with growth within all reportable business segments. recent acquisitions contributed 16.4% and impacted all three revenue types.
capital equipment revenues increased by $16.1 million, or 2.7%, to $613.9 million, during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. this increase was driven by growth within the healthcare products and life sciences business segments. geographically, the north american region was strong with 9% growth offset by declines in other regions. consumable revenues increased $66.1 million, or 14.7%, during fiscal 2016 from fiscal 2015. consumable revenues grew in both the healthcare product and life sciences business segments and experienced growth in all regions. service revenues for fiscal 2016 increased $306.3 million, or 38.2%, over fiscal 2015 driven by the continued expansion of service offerings and the combination with synergy. in addition, all reportable segments also experienced organic service revenue growth.
united kingdom revenues for fiscal 2016 were $144.6 million, an increase of $92.7 million, or 178.6%, over fiscal 2015 revenues of $51.9 million. this increase reflects growth in both consumable and service revenues due primarily to the combination with synergy, partially offset by a decline in capital equipment revenues.

united states revenues for fiscal 2016 were $1,662.1 million, an increase of $212.8 million, or 14.7%, over fiscal 2015 revenues of $1,449.2 million. this increase reflects growth in capital equipment, consumable and service revenues.
revenues from other foreign locations for fiscal 2016 were $432.1 million, an increase of 23.8% over the fiscal 2015 revenues of $349.2 million. this increase reflects revenue growth within the rest of emea and the asia pacific region which were partially offset by declines within the latin america region and canada.

total gross profit percentage          40.0     %                41.8     %
our gross profit is affected by the volume, pricing and mix of sales of our products and services, as well as the costs associated with the products and services that are sold. our gross profit increased $121.2 million and gross profit percentage decreased 180 basis points to 40.0% for fiscal 2016 as compared to 41.8% for fiscal 2015. although our recent acquisitions expanded our gross profit, they negatively impacted our gross margin percentage by approximately 290 basis points. as anticipated, the addition of synergy's hospital sterilization services and linen management businesses is a key factor in the declines in gross margin percentages. we have applied our "four walls" approach to the operation of synergy, which reports all direct and indirect costs related to the delivery of services as costs of goods sold. this approach caused additional costs to be included in costs of goods sold rather than in selling, general and administrative costs as synergy would have previously reported. our gross profit percentage was impacted positively by foreign currency fluctuations (120 basis points.) other factors such as favorable pricing, productivity and material costs served to offset inflation and the negative impact of product mix shift (10 basis points).

nm - not meaningful significant components of total selling, general, and administrative expenses ("sg&a") are compensation and benefit costs, fees for professional services, travel and entertainment, facilities costs, and other general and administrative expenses. sg&a increased 27.0% in fiscal 2016 over fiscal 2015. contributing to this increase was additional acquisition and integration costs related to recent acquisitions, including synergy, of $50.1 million over the prior year period. higher amortization of acquired intangible assets also contributed to the increase in sg&a in both periods. in addition, we incurred $26.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 in connection with the settlement of a legacy pension obligation (see note 10 to our financial statements titled, "benefit plans" for more information).
research and development expenses increased $2.5 million during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015. the increase in fiscal 2016 is attributable to additional spending in connection with the development of healthcare products and accessories. research and development expenses are influenced by the number and timing of in-process projects and labor hours and other
31
costs associated with these projects. our research and development initiatives continue to emphasize new product development, product improvements, and the development of new technological platform innovations. during fiscal 2016, our investments in research and development continued to be focused on, but were not limited to, enhancing capabilities of sterile processing combination technologies, procedural products and accessories, and devices and support accessories used in gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures.
restructuring expenses. we recognize restructuring expenses as they are incurred. we also evaluate the inventory and property, plant and equipment associated with our restructuring actions for impairment. asset impairment and accelerated depreciation expenses primarily relate to inventory write-downs for rationalized products and adjustments in the carrying value of the closed facilities to their estimated fair value. in addition, the remaining useful lives of other property, plant and equipment associated with the related operations were re-evaluated based on the respective plan, resulting in the acceleration of depreciation and amortization of certain assets.
fiscal 2014 restructuring plan.  during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we adopted and announced a targeted restructuring plan primarily focused on the closure of the hopkins manufacturing facility located in mentor, ohio (the "fiscal 2014 restructuring plan"). we believe that by closing the operations at hopkins we will more effectively utilize our existing north american manufacturing network while reducing operating costs. we have incurred pre-tax expenses totaling $19.0 million related to these actions, of which $10.9 million was recorded as restructuring expenses and $8.1 million was recorded in cost of revenues, with restructuring expenses of $15.6 million, $1.3 million, $0.8 million, and $1.3 million related to the healthcare products, healthcare specialty services, life sciences and applied sterilization technologies segments, respectively.
fiscal 2010 restructuring plan. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we adopted a restructuring plan primarily related to the transfer of the remaining operations in our erie, pennsylvania facility to the u.s. headquarters in mentor, ohio and the consolidation of our european healthcare manufacturing operations into two central locations within europe (the "fiscal 2010 restructuring plan"). in addition, we rationalized certain products and eliminated certain positions. since the inception of the fiscal 2010 restructuring plan, we have incurred pre-tax expenses totaling $9.3 million related to these actions, of which $8.2 million was recorded as restructuring expenses and $1.1 million was recorded in cost of revenues. we do not expect to incur any significant additional restructuring expenses related to this plan. these actions are intended to enhance profitability and improve efficiencies.
for more information regarding our restructuring activities please refer to note 2 of our consolidated financial statements titled, "restructuring".

interest expense during fiscal 2016 increased due to higher interest costs resulting from our may 2015 issuance of senior notes in a private placement offering, additional borrowings under our credit facilities to fund acquisitions, including the combination, and the operations of acquired companies, and payments associated with paying off synergy's debt. since the combination our weighted average cost of borrowing has decreased due to an increase in the proportion of lower-cost, variable-rate bank debt. interest income and miscellaneous expense is immaterial.
additional information regarding our outstanding debt is included in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "debt," and in the subsection of md&a titled, "liquidity and capital resources."

the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 35.1% as compared to 35.3% for fiscal 2015. in fiscal 2016, the favorable impact of foreign tax benefits associated with actions taken in conjunction with the mid-year combination with synergy were offset by the unfavorable impact of significant costs associated with the combination that are capitalized for tax purposes or are simply non-deductible. additional information regarding our income tax expense is included in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "income taxes."
business segment results of operations. as a result of the recent combination with synergy, we have reassessed the organization of our business. we have concluded that we operate and will report in four reportable business segments: healthcare products, healthcare specialty services, life sciences, and applied sterilization technologies.
our healthcare products segment offers infection prevention and procedural solutions for healthcare providers worldwide, including capital equipment and related maintenance and installation services, as well as consumables.
our healthcare specialty services segment provides a range of specialty services for healthcare providers including hospital sterilization services, instrument and scope repairs, and linen management.
our life sciences segment offers capital equipment and consumable products, and equipment maintenance and specialty services for pharmaceutical manufacturers and research facilities.
our applied sterilization technologies segment offers contract sterilization and laboratory services for medical device and pharmaceutical customers and others.
corporate and other, which is presented separately, contains the defense and industrial business unit plus costs that are associated with being a publicly traded company and certain other corporate costs. these costs include executive office costs, board of directors compensation, shareholder services and investor relations, external audit fees, and legacy pension and post-retirement benefit costs.
the accounting policies for reportable segments are the same as those for the consolidated company. management will evaluate performance and allocate resources based on a segment operating income measure. operating income (loss) for each segment is calculated as the segment's gross profit less direct expenses and indirect cost allocations, which result in the full allocation of all distribution and research and development expenses, and the partial allocation of corporate costs. these allocations are based upon variables such as segment headcount and revenues. in addition, the healthcare products segment is responsible for the management of all but two manufacturing facilities and uses standard cost to sell products to the other segments. corporate and other includes the gross profit and direct expenses of the defense and industrial business unit, as well as certain unallocated corporate costs related to being a publicly traded company and legacy pension and post-retirement benefits. segment operating income excludes certain adjustments which include acquisition related costs, amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring costs and other charges that management believes may or may not recur with similar materiality or impact on operating income in future periods. management believes that by adjusting for these items they gain better insight and greater transparency of the operating performance of the segments, thus aiding them in more meaningful financial trend analysis and operational decision making. for more information regarding our segments please refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements titled "business segment information," and item 1, "business," provide detailed information regarding each business segment. the following table compares business segment and corporate and other revenues and operating income for the year ended march 31, 2016 to the year ended march 31, 2015:

healthcare product revenues increased 5.6% in the fiscal 2016 year as compared to fiscal 2015. this increase reflects growth in capital equipment, consumable and service revenues of 2.2%, 12.0% and 4.1%, respectively. while the combination with synergy and the acquisition of black diamond were key factors behind the increases, we also experienced strong growth in all three categories in the united states which more than offset weakness in other geographies. at march 31, 2016, the healthcare products segment's backlog amounted to $119.4 million, increasing $21.7 million, or 22.2%, compared to the backlog of $97.7 million at march 31, 2015. the higher backlog level is partially due to our fiscal 2016 acquisition of black diamond and an increase in project orders, which tend to have longer lead times than replacement orders.
healthcare specialty services revenues increased 70.1% in the fiscal 2016 year as compared to fiscal 2015. the fiscal 2016 period includes five months of revenues, or approximately $146.1 million, from the operations acquired in the combination with synergy and 11% growth in legacy operations.
life sciences revenues increased 18.0% in the fiscal 2016 year, as compared to fiscal 2015. consumable revenue grew 33.7% partly due to our fiscal 2016 acquisition of general econopak, inc. ("gepco") and partly due to 9.0% organic revenue growth. growth in capital equipment and service revenues was 5.0% and 13.3%, respectively. service revenue in fiscal 2016 reflect the addition of new service offerings. life sciences backlog at march 31, 2016 amounted to $45.3 million, decreasing $0.2 million compared to the backlog of $45.5 million at march 31, 2015.
applied sterilization technologies revenues increased 50.8% in the fiscal year 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015. the fiscal 2016 period includes 4.2% organic revenue growth plus five months, or approximately $90.6 million, from the combination with synergy. the segment continues to experience increased demand from our core medical device customers.

the healthcare products segment's operating income increased $14.8 million to $181.3 million in fiscal year 2016, as compared to $166.5 million in fiscal year 2015. the segment's operating margin was 15.0% for fiscal year 2016 compared to 14.6% for fiscal year 2015. the increases in fiscal year 2016 are primarily due to the positive impact of increased volumes and favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
the healthcare specialty services segment's operating income increased $7.5 million to $24.2 million for fiscal year 2016 as compared to $16.6 million in fiscal year 2015. the increase in the fiscal 2016 was the result of additional volume in service offerings both from the combination with synergy and organic revenue growth. the segment's operating margin was 5.7% for fiscal year 2016 compared to 6.7% for fiscal year 2015.
the life sciences business segment's operating income increased $29.4 million to $85.5 million for fiscal year 2016 as compared to $56.1 million in fiscal year 2015. the segment's operating margin was 28.9% for fiscal year 2016 compared to 22.4% for fiscal year 2015. the increase in operating margin in fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to increased volumes in consumable and service offerings which generate higher margins, including expanded products and service offering from our recent acquisitions.
the applied sterilization technologies segment's operating income increased $39.8 million to $99.2 million for fiscal year 2016 as compared to $59.5 million for fiscal year 2015. the applied sterilization technologies segment's operating margin was 32.0% for fiscal year 2016 compared to 28.9% for fiscal year 2015. the segment's operating margin increase in fiscal 2016 was the result of the positive impact of additional volume both from the acquisition of synergy and organic revenue growth.

capital equipment revenues decreased by $5.8 million, or 1.0%, to $597.8 million, during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. growth within the emea and asia pacific regions was more than offset by declines within the north american and latin american regions. consumable revenues increased $42.1 million, or 10.3%, during fiscal 2015 from fiscal 2014. this increase was driven by growth within the healthcare products, healthcare specialty services and life sciences business segments and reflected growth in all regions. service revenues for fiscal 2015 increased $191.7 million, or 31.4%, over fiscal 2014 primarily driven by the fiscal 2015 acquisition of ims, other service offerings, and growth of $11.5 million, or 5.9%, within the applied sterilization technologies segment in fiscal 2015 over fiscal 2014. applied sterilization technologies revenues were favorably impacted by increased demand from our medical device customers.
united kingdom revenues for fiscal 2015 were $51.9 million, an increase of $24.2 million, or 87.5%, over fiscal 2014 revenues of $27.7 million. this increase reflected strong growth in capital equipment, consumable and service revenues. revenues associated with our late fiscal 2014 acquisition of eschmann contributed to growth in capital equipment and service revenues.
35
united states revenues for fiscal 2015 were $1,449.2 million, an increase of $204.5 million, or 16.4%, over fiscal 2014 revenues of $1,244.7 million. this increase was primarily attributable to the fiscal 2015 acquisition of ims but also reflects growth in service revenues in the other three business segments, growth in capital equipment revenues within the healthcare specialty services and life sciences business segments and growth in consumable revenues within the healthcare products and life science business segments.
revenues from other foreign locations for fiscal 2015 were $349.2 million, a slight decrease of 0.2%, over the fiscal 2014 revenues of $349.8 million. the decrease was attributable to declines within the latin america region and in canada, which was partially offset by growth within the emea and asia pacific regions.

nm - not meaningful significant components of total selling, general, and administrative expenses ("sg&a") are compensation and benefit costs, fees for professional services, travel and entertainment, facilities costs, and other general and administrative expenses. sg&a increased 29.5% during fiscal 2015 over fiscal 2014. this increase was primarily attributable to the addition of operating expenses incurred within our recently acquired businesses and costs of approximately $22.2 million incurred in connection with the then proposed combination with synergy. for additional information regarding the combination see note 3 of our consolidated financial statements titled, "business acquisitions". also, during the second quarter of fiscal 2015, sg&a was impacted by the adoption of a new branding strategy as part of the integration of ims into the specialty services reporting unit for surgical instrument and endoscope repair services. this strategy resulted in the reduction in the carrying value of the spectrum surgical instruments corp. ("spectrum") trade-name which will be used solely for specialty services product revenues going forward. we have estimated the fair value of the spectrum trade-name using the relief from royalty
36
method and concluded that the carrying value of the trade-name exceeded its fair value. as a result, an impairment charge of approximately $5.6 million was recorded to reduce the carrying value of the intangible asset.
research and development expenses increased $5.5 million during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. the increase in the fiscal 2015 period was primarily attributable to additional spending in connection with the development of surgical products and accessories. research and development expenses are influenced by the number and timing of in-process projects and labor hours and other costs associated with these projects. our research and development initiatives continue to emphasize new product development, product improvements, and the development of new technological platform innovations. during fiscal 2015, our investments in research and development continued to be focused on, but were not limited to, enhancing capabilities of sterile processing combination technologies, surgical products and accessories, and devices and support accessories used in gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures.
restructuring expenses. we recognize restructuring expenses as they are incurred. we also evaluate the inventory and property, plant and equipment associated with our restructuring actions for impairment. asset impairment and accelerated depreciation expenses primarily relate to inventory write-downs for rationalized products and adjustments in the carrying value of the closed facilities to their estimated fair value. in addition, the remaining useful lives of other property, plant and equipment associated with the related operations were re-evaluated based on the respective plan, resulting in the acceleration of depreciation and amortization of certain assets.
fiscal 2014 restructuring plan.  during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we adopted and announced a targeted restructuring plan primarily focused on the closure of the hopkins manufacturing facility located in mentor, ohio (the "fiscal 2014 restructuring plan"). as a result of this plan we will transfer operations located at hopkins to other north american locations. we believe that by closing the operations at hopkins we will more effectively utilize our existing north american manufacturing network while reducing operating costs. we have incurred pre-tax expenses totaling $19.5 million related to these actions, of which $11.7 million was recorded as restructuring expenses and $7.8 million was recorded in cost of revenues, with restructuring expenses of $15.4 million, $2.0 million, $0.8 million, and $1.3 million related to the healthcare products, healthcare specialty services, life sciences and applied sterilization technologies segments, respectively.
fiscal 2010 restructuring plan. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we adopted a restructuring plan primarily related to the transfer of the remaining operations in our erie, pennsylvania facility to the u.s. headquarters in mentor, ohio and the consolidation of our european healthcare manufacturing operations into two central locations within europe (the "fiscal 2010 restructuring plan"). in addition, we rationalized certain products and eliminated certain positions.since the inception of the fiscal 2010 restructuring plan, we have incurred pre-tax expenses totaling $9.3 million related to these actions, of which $8.2 million was recorded as restructuring expenses and $1.1 million was recorded in cost of revenues. we do not expect to incur any significant additional restructuring expenses related to this plan. these actions are intended to enhance profitability and improve efficiencies.

business segment results of operations. as a result of the fiscal 2016 combination with synergy, we have reassessed the organization of our business. we have concluded that we operate and will report in four reportable business segments: healthcare products, healthcare specialty services, life sciences, and applied sterilization technologies. corporate and other, which is presented separately, contains the defense and industrial business unit plus costs that are associated with being a publicly traded company and certain other corporate costs. these costs include executive office costs, board of directors compensation, shareholder services and investor relations, external audit fees, and legacy pension and post-retirement benefit costs.
the accounting policies for reportable segments are the same as those for the consolidated company. management will evaluate performance and allocate resources based on a segment operating income measure. operating income (loss) for each segment is calculated as the segment's gross profit less direct expenses and indirect cost allocations, which result in the full allocation of all distribution and research and development expenses, and the partial allocation of corporate costs. these allocations are based upon variables such as segment headcount and revenues. in addition, the healthcare products segment is responsible for the management of all but two manufacturing facilities and uses standard cost to sell products to the other segments. corporate and other includes the gross profit and direct expenses of the defense and industrial business unit, as well as certain unallocated corporate costs related to being a publicly traded company and legacy pension and post-retirement benefits. segment operating income excludes certain adjustments which include acquisition related costs, amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring costs and other charges that management believes may or may not recur with similar materiality or impact on operating income in future periods. management believes that by adjusting for these items they gain better insight and greater transparency of the operating performance of the segments, thus aiding them in more meaningful financial trend analysis and operational decision making. for more information regarding our segments please refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements titled "business segment information," and item 1, "business," provide detailed information regarding each business segment. the following table has been restated to reflect the new segment structure and segment operating income measure and compares business segment and corporate and other revenues and operating income for the year ended march 31, 2015 to the year ended march 31, 2014:

healthcare products segment revenues increased $50.8 million, or 4.6% to $1,143.3 million for the year ended march 31, 2015, as compared to $1,092.6 million for the prior fiscal year. the increase was attributable to growth in consumable and service revenues of 8.8% and 9.3%, respectively, and growth within all geographic regions except the latin america region. at march 31, 2015, the healthcare segment's backlog amounted to $97.7 million, decreasing $12.7 million, or 11.5%, compared to the backlog of $110.3 million at march 31, 2014. this decrease was partially the result of our success in reducing our manufacturing lead times allowing us to fulfill orders on a timelier basis. in addition, replacement orders represent a larger percentage of our order pattern and pipeline, and those orders tend to be filled quicker and reside in backlog for less time.
healthcare specialty services segment revenues increased $161.1 million, or 184.2% to $248.5 million for the year ended march 31, 2015, as compared to $87.5 million for the prior fiscal year. the addition of service revenues from our acquisition of ims combined with growth in other product and service offerings drove total growth in consumable and service revenues of 48.5% and 206.0%, respectively.
life sciences segment revenues increased $4.7 million or 1.9% to $250.8 million for the year ended march 31, 2015, as compared to the prior fiscal year, driven by growth in consumable and service revenues of 10.1% and 5.0%, respectively, which was offset by a 8.4% decline in capital equipment revenues. at march 31, 2015, the life sciences segment's backlog amounted to $45.5 million, decreasing $1.1 million, or 2.4%, compared to the backlog of $44.4 million at march 31, 2014. the march 31, 2015 backlog is consistent with historic levels.
applied sterilization technologies segment revenues increased $11.5 million or 5.9% to $205.7 million for the year ended march 31, 2015, as compared to the prior fiscal year. revenues were favorably impacted by increased demand from our medical device customers.

the healthcare products segment's operating income increased $19.1 million, or 12.9% to $166.5 million for the year ended march 31, 2015, as compared to $147.5 million for the prior fiscal year. the increase in operating income in fiscal 2015 over fiscal 2014 was driven by increased volume, favorable foreign currency, and favorable product mix. these increases were somewhat offset by rising material costs and the medical device excise tax.
the healthcare specialty services segment's operating income increased $14.2 million, to $16.6 million for the year ended march 31, 2015, as compared to $2.4 million for the prior fiscal year. the increase in operating income in fiscal 2015 over fiscal 2014 was driven by our recent acquisition of ims and increased volume in existing operations.
the life science segment's operating income increased $5.3 million, or 10.4% to $56.1 million for the year ended march 31, 2015, as compared to $50.8 million for the prior fiscal year. the segment's operating margins were 22.4% and 20.6%, respectively, for the years ended march 31, 2015 and march 31, 2014. the improvement was primarily attributable to higher revenues, favorable foreign currency and favorable product mix.
the applied sterilization technologies segment operating income increased $1.9 million or 3.2% to $59.5 million for the year ended march 31, 2015, as compared to $57.6 million for the prior fiscal year, reflecting the benefits of increased revenues. the segment's operating margins were 28.9% and 29.7%, respectively, for the years ended march 31, 2015 and march 31, 2014. the operating margin decline is primarily due to higher regulatory costs.

•   cash dividends paid to ordinary shareholders - during fiscal 2016, we paid cash dividends totaling $65.2 million or $0.98 per outstanding share. during fiscal 2015, we paid cash dividends totaling $53.5 million or $0.90 per outstanding share. during fiscal 2014, we paid cash dividends totaling $48.4 million, or $0.82 per outstanding share.
•   stock option and other equity transactions, net - we receive cash for issuing shares under our various employee stock option programs. during fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, we received cash proceeds totaling $11.2 million $28.3 million, and $14.2 million, respectively, under these programs. in fiscal 2014, we also issued $1.5 million of steris restricted stock in conjunction with the lsi acquisition.
•   excess tax benefit from share-based compensation - for the years ended march 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our income taxes were reduced by $6.3 million, $11.5 million, and $2.8 million, respectively, as a result of deductions allowed for stock options exercised and restricted share vestings. the increase in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to an increase in both the quantity and value of restricted shares vesting and stock options exercised.
cash flow measures. free cash flow was $129.1 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $161.6 million in fiscal 2015. the decrease in cash flow from operations are primarily due to expenses related to the combination with synergy and other acquisitions. in addition, cash flow from operations was reduced by an increase in the amount paid in fiscal 2016 over fiscal 2015 related to our annual compensation program and a pension contribution made in connection with the settlement of a legacy pension obligation (see subsection of md&a titled, "non-gaap financial measures", for additional information and related reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap measures). our debt-to-total capital ratio was 34.2% at march 31, 2016 and 36.7% at march 31, 2015.
cash requirements. we intend to use our existing cash and cash equivalent balances and cash generated from operations for short-term and long-term capital expenditures and our other liquidity needs. our capital requirements depend on many uncertain factors, including our rate of sales growth, our customers' acceptance of our products and services, the costs of obtaining adequate manufacturing capacities, the timing and extent of our research and development projects, changes in our operating expenses and other factors. to the extent that existing and anticipated sources of cash are not sufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through additional borrowings or the sale of equity securities. there can be no assurance that our existing financing arrangements will provide us with sufficient funds or that we will be able to obtain any additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all.
at march 31, 2016, approximately 98.0% of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were held in non-united states legal entities. these funds are considered indefinitely reinvested to be used to expand operations either organically or through acquisitions outside the united states. our united states operations generate cash flow sufficient to satisfy united states operating requirements and service debt. we do not intend to repatriate any significant amounts of cash in the foreseeable future.

our sources of funding from credit as of march 31, 2016 are summarized below:
•   in order to fund the acquisition of synergy, including the cash payments made in respect of synergy shares, the repayment of synergy debt and certain transaction expenses, on november 2, 2015, steris plc borrowed (under its credit agreement as herein-after defined) (i) $132.0 million, £49.0 million, and €127.8 million under the revolving credit facility and (ii) $400.0 million under the term loan facility. borrowings bear interest, at our option, based upon either the base rate or the eurocurrency rate, plus the applicable margin in effect from time to time under the credit agreement. the applicable margin is determined based on the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda. interest on base rate advances is payable quarterly in arrears and interest on eurocurrency rate advances is payable at the end of the relevant interest period therefor, but in no event less frequently than every three months.
•   on may 15, 2015, old steris issued $350.0 million of senior notes, in a private placement to certain institutional investors in an offering that was exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of 1933. of the $350.0 million in senior notes, $125.0 million have a maturity of 10 years from the issue date at an annual interest rate of 3.45%, $125.0 million have a maturity of 12 years from the issue date at an annual interest rate of 3.55% and $100.0 million have a maturity of 15 years from the issue date at an annual interest rate of 3.70%. these borrowings will be used for repayment of credit facility debt and for other corporate purposes. the agreement governing these notes contains leverage and interest coverage covenants.
•   on march 31, 2015, old steris and steris entered into a credit agreement (the "credit agreement") with various financial institutions as lenders, and jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., as administrative agent. the credit agreement replaced the company's third amended and restated credit agreement dated april 13, 2012 with keybank national association, as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto, as amended, and the company's swing line facility (committed line of credit) with pnc bank, national association, which agreements were terminated and all outstanding borrowings thereunder were repaid on march 31, 2015. the credit agreement currently provides $1,245.0 million of credit, in the form of a $850.0 million revolver facility, which may be utilized for revolving credit borrowings, swing line borrowings and letters of credit, with sublimits for swing line borrowings and letters of credit. the credit agreement also contains a $400.0 million term loan facility. the revolver and term loan facilities may be increased in specified circumstances by up to $500.0 million. term loans are repayable quarterly pursuant to a specified amortization schedule, with principal payments increasing from 1.25% to 2.50% over the term, and with a balloon payment for the remaining unpaid balance at maturity. as of march 31, 2016, a total $905.2 million of indebtedness was outstanding under the credit agreement. the credit agreement will mature on march 31, 2020, and all unpaid borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, are repayable on that date. the credit agreement contains leverage and interest coverage covenants.

at march 31, 2016, we had $339.8 million of funding available under the credit agreement. the credit agreement includes a sub-limit that reduces the maximum amount available to us by letters of credit outstanding. at march 31, 2016, there were no letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement.
at march 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with our indebtedness. we provide additional information regarding our debt structure and payment obligations in the section of the md&a titled, "liquidity and capital resources" in the subsection titled, "contractual and commercial commitments" and in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "debt."
capital expenditures our capital expenditure program is a component of our long-term strategy. this program includes, among other things, investments in new and existing facilities, business expansion projects, radioisotope (cobalt-60), linens and information technology enhancements and research and development advances. during fiscal 2016, our capital expenditures amounted to $126.4 million. we use cash provided by operating activities and our cash and cash equivalent balances to fund capital expenditures. we expect fiscal 2017 capital expenditures to increase to approximately $190.0 million, which includes investment in projects to expand capacity for our applied sterilization technologies segment, investments required for service contracts in our healthcare specialty services segment and to upgrade our it systems, along with routine maintenance capital expenditures.
contractual and commercial commitments at march 31, 2016, we had commitments under non-cancelable operating leases totaling $134.9 million.
our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of march 31, 2016 are presented in the following tables. commercial commitments include standby letters of credit, letters of credit required as security under our self-insured risk retention policies, and other potential cash outflows resulting from events that require us to fulfill commitments.

critical accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions the following subsections describe our most critical accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions. our accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies."
estimates and assumptions.  our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles. we make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when preparing these financial statements. these estimates and assumptions involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management's control. as a result, actual amounts could be materially different from these estimates. we periodically review these critical accounting policies, estimates, assumptions, and the related disclosures with the audit committee of the company's board of directors.
revenue recognition.  we recognize revenue for products when ownership passes to the customer, which is based on contract or shipping terms and for services when the service is provided to the customer. our customers include end users as well as dealers and distributors who market and sell our products. our revenue is not contingent upon resale by the dealer or distributor. we have no further obligations related to bringing about resale, and our standard return and restocking fee policies are applied.
we also have individual customer contracts that offer extended payment terms and/or discounted pricing. dealers and distributors may be offered sales incentives in the form of rebates. we reduce revenue for discounts and estimated returns, rebates, and other similar allowances in the same period the related revenues are recorded. returns, rebates, and similar allowances are estimated based on historical experience and trend analysis.
in transactions that contain multiple elements, such as when products, maintenance services, and other services are combined, we recognize revenue as each product is delivered or service is provided to the customer. we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each element based on its relative fair value, based on the price for the product or service when it is sold separately.
we offer preventive maintenance agreements to our customers with contract terms that range from one to five years, which require us to maintain and repair our products during this time. amounts received under these customer contracts are initially recorded as deferred service revenues and then recognized as service revenues ratably over the contract term.
we classify shipping and handling amounts billed to customers in sales transactions as revenues.
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable.  we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses in the collection of amounts owed by customers. we estimate the allowance based on analyzing a number of factors, including amounts written off historically, customer payment practices, and general economic conditions. we also analyze significant customer accounts on a regular basis and record a specific allowance when we become aware of a specific
45
customer's inability to pay. as a result, the related accounts receivable are reduced to an amount that we reasonably believe is collectible. these analyses require a considerable amount of judgment. if the financial condition of our customers worsens, or economic conditions change, we may be required to make changes to our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable.
allowance for sales returns.  we maintain an allowance for sales returns based upon known returns and estimated returns for both capital equipment and consumables. we estimate returns of capital equipment and consumables based upon historical experience less the estimated inventory value of the returned goods.
inventories and reserves.  inventories are stated at the lower of their cost or market value. we determine cost based upon a combination of the last-in, first-out ("lifo") and first-in, first-out ("fifo") cost methods. we determine the lifo inventory value at the end of the year based on inventory levels and costs at that time. for inventories valued using the lifo method, we believe that the use of the lifo method results in a matching of current costs and revenues. inventories valued using the lifo method represented approximately 31.0% and 35.9% of total inventories at march 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. inventory costs include material, labor, and overhead. if we had used only the fifo method of inventory costing, inventories would have been $17.6 million and $19.1 million higher than those reported at march 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
we review the net realizable value of inventory on an ongoing basis, considering factors such as deterioration, obsolescence, and other items. we record an allowance for estimated losses when the facts and circumstances indicate that particular inventories will not be usable. if future market conditions vary from those projected, and our estimates prove to be inaccurate, we may be required to write-down inventory values and record an adjustment to cost of revenues.
asset impairment losses.  property, plant, equipment, and identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. impaired assets are recorded at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value. we conduct this review on an ongoing basis and, if impairment exists, we record the loss in the consolidated statements of income during that period.
when we evaluate assets for impairment, we make certain judgments and estimates, including interpreting current economic indicators and market valuations, evaluating our strategic plans with regards to operations, historical and anticipated performance of operations, and other factors. if we incorrectly anticipate these factors, or unexpected events occur, our operating results could be materially affected.
asset retirement obligations. we incur retirement obligations for certain assets. we record an initial liability for the asset retirement obligations (aro) at fair value. accounting for the aro at inception and in subsequent periods includes the determination of the present value of a liability and offsetting asset, the subsequent accretion of that liability and depletion of the asset, and a periodic review of the aro liability estimates and discount rates used in the analysis. we provide additional information about our asset retirement obligations in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "property, plant and equipment."
restructuring.  we record specific accruals in connection with plans for restructuring elements of our business. these accruals include estimates principally related to employee separation costs, the closure and/or consolidation of facilities, and contractual obligations. actual amounts could differ from the original estimates.
we review our restructuring-related accruals on a quarterly basis and changes to plans are appropriately recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the period the change is identified. note 2 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "restructuring," summarizes our restructuring plans.
purchase accounting and goodwill.  assets and liabilities of the business acquired are accounted for at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. we supplement management expertise with valuation specialists in performing appraisals to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. these valuations require us to make estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. we generally amortize our intangible assets over their useful lives with the exception of indefinite lived intangible assets. we do not amortize goodwill, but we evaluate it annually for impairment. therefore, the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on future operating results.
we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. we may consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill. we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. in those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. we calculate the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.
46
we performed our annual goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment evaluation as of october 31, 2015. based on this evaluation, we determined that there was no impairment of the recorded amounts.
we evaluate indefinite lived intangible assets annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. we evaluate several qualitative indicators and assumptions, and trends that influence the valuation of the assets to determine if any evidence of potential impairment exists.
income taxes.  our provision for income taxes is based on our current period income, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, income tax rates, changes in uncertain tax benefits, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the respective governmental taxing authorities. we use significant judgment in determining our annual effective income tax rate and evaluating our tax positions. we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. we cannot be sure that the tax authorities will agree with all of the tax positions taken by us. the actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can, in some instances, be ultimately determined several years after the tax return is filed and the financial statements are published.
we evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and measurement attribute in accordance with current accounting guidance. we determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority and that the taxing authority will have full knowledge of all relevant information. a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the appropriate unit of account for determining what constitutes an individual tax position, and whether the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a tax position, is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence. we review and adjust our tax estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and precedent.
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies. if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a material change in the effective income tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowance, which would increase our effective income tax rate and could result in an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
we believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes. differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution, individually or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flow for any one period.
additional information regarding income taxes is included in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "income taxes."
self-insurance liabilities.  we record a liability for self-insured risks that we retain for general and product liabilities, workers' compensation, and automobile liabilities based on actuarial calculations. we use our historical loss experience and actuarial methods to calculate the estimated liability. this liability includes estimated amounts for both losses and incurred but not reported claims. we review the assumptions used to calculate the estimated liability at least annually to evaluate the adequacy of the amount recorded. we maintain insurance policies to cover losses greater than our estimated liability, which are subject to the terms and conditions of those policies. the obligation covered by insurance contracts will remain on the balance sheet as we remain liable to the extent insurance carriers do not meet their obligation. estimated amounts receivable under the contracts are included in the "prepaid expenses and other current assets" line, and the "other assets" line of our consolidated balance sheets. our accrual for self-insured risk retention as of march 31, 2016 and 2015 was $20.2 million and $18.1 million, respectively.
we are also self-insured for employee medical claims. we estimate a liability for incurred but not reported claims based upon recent claims experience.
our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management must make assumptions and apply judgments to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. if actual results are not consistent with these assumptions and judgments, we could be exposed to additional costs in subsequent periods.

contingencies.  we are, and will likely continue to be, involved in a number of legal proceedings, government investigations, and claims, which we believe generally arise in the course of our business, given our size, history, complexity, and the nature of our business, products, customers, regulatory environment, and industries in which we participate. these legal proceedings, investigations and claims generally involve a variety of legal theories and allegations, including, without limitation, personal injury (e.g., slip and falls, burns, vehicle accidents), product liability or regulation (e.g., based on product operation or claimed malfunction, failure to warn, failure to meet specification, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements), product exposure (e.g., claimed exposure to chemicals, asbestos, contaminants, radiation), property damage (e.g., claimed damage due to leaking equipment, fire, vehicles, chemicals), commercial claims (e.g., breach of contract, economic loss, warranty, misrepresentation), financial (e.g., taxes, reporting), employment (e.g., wrongful termination, discrimination, benefits matters), and other claims for damage and relief.
we record a liability for such contingencies to the extent we conclude that their occurrence is both probable and estimable. we consider many factors in making these assessments, including the professional judgment of experienced members of management and our legal counsel. we have made estimates as to the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and the amounts of such potential losses. in our opinion, the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and claims is not anticipated to have a material adverse affect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. however, the ultimate outcome of proceedings, government investigations, and claims is unpredictable and actual results could be materially different from our estimates. we record expected recoveries under applicable insurance contracts when we are assured of recovery. refer to note 11 of our consolidated financial statements titled, "commitments and contingencies" for additional information.
we are subject to taxation from federal, state and local, and foreign jurisdictions. tax positions are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation. changes in applicable tax law or other events may also require us to revise past estimates. the irs of the united states routinely conducts audits of our federal income tax returns.
additional information regarding our commitments and contingencies is included in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "commitments and contingencies."
benefit plans.  we provide defined benefit pension plans for certain employees and retirees as determined by collective bargaining agreements or employee benefit standards set at the time of acquisition of certain businesses. in addition, we sponsor an unfunded post-retirement welfare benefits plan for two groups of united states retirees. benefits under this plan include retiree life insurance and retiree medical insurance, including prescription drug coverage.
employee pension and post-retirement welfare benefits plans are a cost of conducting business and represent obligations that will be settled in the future and therefore, require us to use estimates and make certain assumptions to calculate the expense and liabilities related to the plans. changes to these estimates and assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts. future actual experience may be significantly different from our current expectations. we believe that the most critical assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. a summary of significant assumptions used to determine the march 31, 2016 projected benefit obligations and the fiscal 2016 net periodic benefit costs is as follows:

expectations. generally, net periodic benefit costs increase as the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption decreases. holding all other assumptions constant, lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption for our funded defined benefit pension plans by 50 basis points would have increased the fiscal 2016 benefit costs by less than $0.1 million.
we develop our discount rate assumptions by evaluating input from third-party professional advisors, taking into consideration the current yield on country specific investment grade long-term bonds which provide for similar cash flow streams as our projected benefit obligations. generally, the projected benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs both increase as the discount rate assumption decreases. holding all other assumptions constant, lowering the discount rate assumption for our defined benefit pension plans and for the other post-retirement plan by 50 basis points would have decreased the fiscal 2016 net periodic benefit costs by less than $0.1 million and would have increased the projected benefit obligations by approximately $10.2 million at march 31, 2016.
we have made assumptions regarding healthcare costs in computing our other post-retirement benefit obligation. the assumed rates of increase generally decline ratably over a five year-period from the assumed current year healthcare cost trend rate of 7% to the assumed long-term healthcare cost trend rate. a 100 basis point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate (including medical, prescription drug, and long-term rates) would have had the following effect at march 31, 2016:

we recognize an asset for the overfunded status or a liability for the underfunded status of defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans in our balance sheets. this amount is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation (the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation for other post-retirement benefit plans). changes in the funded status of the plans are recorded in other comprehensive income in the year they occur. we measure plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date. note 10 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "benefit plans," contains additional information about our pension and other post-retirement welfare benefits plans.
share-based compensation.  we measure the estimated fair value for share-based compensation awards, including grants of employee stock options at the grant date and recognize the related compensation expense over the period in which the share-based compensation vests. we selected the black-scholes-merton option pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value of our share-based stock option compensation awards. this model involves assumptions that are judgmental and affect share-based compensation expense.
share-based compensation expense was $16.1 million in fiscal 2016, $14.9 million in fiscal 2015 and $11.1 million in fiscal 2014. note 15 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "share-based compensation," contains additional information about our share-based compensation plans.
recently issued accounting standards impacting the company recently issued accounting standards that are relevant to us are presented in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies."
inflation our business has not been significantly impacted by the overall effects of inflation. we monitor the prices we charge for our products and services on an ongoing basis and plan to adjust those prices to take into account future changes in the rate of inflation. however, we may not be able to completely offset the impact of inflation.

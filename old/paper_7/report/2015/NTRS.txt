item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview northern trust corporation (corporation) is a financial holding company that is a leading provider of asset servicing, fund administration, asset management, fiduciary and banking solutions for corporations, institutions, families and individuals worldwide. northern trust focuses on managing and servicing client assets through its two client-focused reporting segments: corporate & institutional services (c&is) and wealth management. asset management and related services are provided to c&is and wealth management clients primarily by the asset management business.
the corporation conducts business through various u.s. and non-u.s. subsidiaries, including the northern trust company (bank). the corporation was originally formed as a holding company for the bank in 1971. the corporation has a network of offices in 19 u.s. states, washington, d.c., and 20 international locations in canada, europe, the middle east, and the asia-pacific region. except where the context otherwise requires, the term "northern trust" refers to northern trust corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
financial overview net income in 2015 totaled $973.8 million, up 20% from $811.8 million in 2014. earnings per diluted common share totaled $3.99 in 2015 compared to $3.32 in 2014. return on average common equity improved to 11.5% in 2015, from 10.0% in 2014. the current year includes a pre-tax gain on the sale of 1.0 million shares of visa inc. class b common stock (visa class b common shares) totaling $99.9 million, voluntary cash contributions to certain constant dollar net-asset-value (nav) funds of $45.8 million and the impairment of the residual value of certain aircraft under leveraged lease agreements of $17.8 million. excluding these current-year items, net income per diluted common share, net income and return on average common equity were $3.90, $951.4 million and 11.3%, respectively. net income in 2014 included pre-tax charges and write-offs totaling $47.5 million. excluding these prior-year charges and write-offs, net income per diluted common share, net income and return on average common equity were $3.45, $843.0 million and 10.4%, respectively.
the 2015 results reflect a continued focus on serving the complex and evolving needs of our clients, while enhancing profitability and returns for our stockholders. revenue increased 9% to $4.70 billion in 2015 from $4.33 billion in the prior year, driven by a 5% increase in trust, investment and other servicing fees and a 6% increase in net interest income. noninterest expense increased 5% to $3.28 billion in 2015 compared to $3.14 billion in 2014, attributable to increased compensation, equipment and software, outside services and employee benefits expense.
trust, investment and other servicing fees, which represent the largest component of total revenue, increased 5% to $2.98 billion, from $2.83 billion in 2014, primarily due to new business, favorable equity markets and lower money market mutual fund fee waivers, partially offset by the unfavorable impacts of movements in foreign exchange rates.
foreign exchange trading income of $261.8 million increased 25% from $210.1 million in 2014, resulting from higher currency market volatility.
other operating income in 2015 includes the $99.9 million gain on the sale of a portion of the visa class b common shares held by northern trust.
client assets under custody and under management were up 2% and down 6%, respectively, as of december 31, 2015 as compared to december 31, 2014 levels. as of december 31, 2015, client assets under custody increased to $6.07 trillion from $5.97 trillion, and included $3.53 trillion of global custody assets, up 2% from $3.46 trillion in 2014. as of december 31, 2015, client assets under management decreased to $875.3 billion from $934.1 billion in 2014.
reported net interest income of $1.07 billion increased 6%, reflecting higher levels of earnings assets.
the provision for credit losses was a credit of $43.0 million in 2015, reflecting continued improvement in credit quality across the portfolio coupled with the adoption of a change in estimation methodology for inherent losses. the provision for credit losses in 2014 was $6.0 million. loans and leases as of december 31, 2015 totaled $33.2 billion, up 5% from $31.6 billion in 2014. net charge-offs for the year ended december 31, 2015 and nonperforming assets as of december 31, 2015, were $19.5 million and $188.3 million, respectively, compared to $18.0 million and $232.3 million in 2014.
total noninterest expense equaled $3.28 billion, up 5% from 2014. the current year includes a $45.8 million charge related to voluntary cash contributions to certain constant dollar nav funds, while the prior year included pre-tax charges and write-offs of $47.5 million. excluding these charges and write-offs, noninterest expense increased $147.3 million, or 5%, attributable to increased compensation, equipment and software, outside services and employee benefits expense.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations northern trust continued to maintain a strong capital position during 2015, with all capital ratios exceeding those required for classification as "well-capitalized" under federal bank regulatory capital requirements. total stockholders' equity equaled $8.7 billion at year-end, up 3% from $8.4 billion in 2014. during the year ended december 31, 2015, northern trust increased its quarterly common stock dividend to $0.36 per share and repurchased 6.9 million shares of common stock, returning $829.9 million in capital to common stockholders, compared to $792.4 million in 2014.
consolidated results of operations revenue northern trust generates the majority of its revenue from noninterest income that primarily consists of trust, investment and other servicing fees. net interest income comprises the remainder of revenue and consists of interest income generated by earning assets, net of interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds.
revenue in 2015 was $4.70 billion, an increase of 9% from $4.33 billion in 2014. noninterest income, representing 77% of total revenue in both 2015 and 2014, totaled $3.63 billion and $3.33 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively, up 9% in 2015.
the current-year increase in noninterest income primarily reflected higher trust, investment and other servicing fees, other operating income and foreign exchange trading income. trust, investment and other servicing fees totaled $2.98 billion in 2015, up $147.7 million, or 5%, from $2.83 billion in 2014, primarily reflecting new business, favorable equity markets and lower money market mutual fund fee waivers, partially offset by the unfavorable impacts of movements in foreign exchange rates. foreign exchange trading income in 2015 totaled $261.8 million, up $51.7 million, or 25%, compared with $210.1 million in 2014, reflecting higher currency market volatility. other operating income in 2015 includes a $99.9 million gain on the sale of a portion of the visa class b common shares held by northern trust.
net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (fte) basis in 2015 was $1.10 billion, an increase of $60.5 million, or 6%, from $1.03 billion in 2014, attributable to higher levels of earnings assets, partially offset by a decline in the net interest margin. average earning assets increased $6.3 billion, or 7% in 2015, reflecting higher levels of securities and loans and leases. the net interest margin declined to 1.07% in 2015 from 1.08% in 2014. the net interest margin reflects the impact of a $17.8 million impairment of the residual value of certain aircraft under leveraged lease agreements. excluding the impairment, the net interest margin was 1.09% in 2015.

trust, investment and other servicing fees trust, investment and other servicing fees were $2.98 billion in 2015 compared with $2.83 billion in 2014. trust, investment and other servicing fees are based primarily on the market value of assets held in custody, managed and serviced; the volume of transactions; securities lending volume and spreads; and fees for other services rendered. certain market value calculations on which fees are based are performed on a monthly or quarterly basis in arrears. based on an analysis of historical trends and current asset and product mix, management estimates that a 10% rise or fall in overall equity markets would cause a corresponding increase or decrease in northern trust's trust, investment and other servicing fees of approximately 3% and in total revenue of approximately 2%. for a more detailed discussion of 2015 trust, investment and other servicing fees, refer to the "reporting segments and related information" section.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations foreign exchange trading income northern trust provides foreign exchange services in the normal course of business as an integral part of its global custody services. active management of currency positions, within conservative limits, also contributes to foreign exchange trading income. foreign exchange trading income totaled $261.8 million in 2015 compared with $210.1 million in the prior year. the increase of $51.7 million, or 25%, is attributable to higher currency market volatility in 2015.
treasury management fees treasury management fees, generated from cash and treasury management products and services provided to clients, totaled $64.7 million, down 2% from $66.0 million in 2014.
security commissions and trading income security commissions and trading income is generated primarily from securities brokerage services provided by northern trust securities, inc., and totaled $78.7 million in 2015, up 16%, or $11.1 million, from $67.6 million in 2014, primarily due to higher income from interest rate protection products sold to clients.

other income in 2015 includes a $99.9 million net gain on the sale of 1.0 million visa class b common shares held by northern trust. in addition, other income in 2015 includes a $25.9 million net gain on the sale of certain loans and leases, offset by a $27.0 million fair value adjustment on leases classified as held for sale as of december 31, 2015, each of which is related to the decision to exit a portion of a non-strategic loan and lease portfolio. excluding these current-year items, the "other" component of other operating income was relatively unchanged from 2014.
investment security losses, net net investment security losses totaled $0.3 million and $4.3 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. there were no other-than-temporary impairment (otti) losses in 2015. losses in 2014 include $4.2 million of charges related to the otti of certain community reinvestment act (cra) eligible held to maturity securities.
noninterest income - 2014 compared with 2013
trust, investment and other servicing fees were $2.83 billion in 2014, up 9% from $2.61 billion in 2013, primarily attributable to new business and the favorable impact of equity markets and movements in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by higher waived fees in money market mutual funds. foreign exchange trading income decreased 14% in 2014 to $210.1 million from $244.4 million in 2013, reflecting lower currency market volatility and client volumes as compared to 2013.
other operating income totaled $153.5 million in 2014, a decrease of 8% from $166.5 million in 2013. other operating income in 2013 included the $32.6 million gain on the sale of an office building property, partially offset by the $12.4 million write-off of certain fee receivables. excluding these items, other operating income in 2014 increased 5% from 2013, primarily attributable to increased income from currency-related hedging, lease-related and third party servicing activities in 2014.
net investment security losses totaled $4.3 million and $1.5 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. results for 2014 include $4.2 million of pre-tax charges for the credit-related otti of certain cra eligible securities held within northern trust's balance sheet investment securities portfolio. there were no otti losses in 2013.
net interest income net interest income stated on an fte basis is a non-generally-accepted-accounting-principle (gaap) financial measure that facilitates the analysis of asset yields. management believes an fte presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest margins for comparative purposes. when adjusted to an fte basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable, and partially

net interest income is defined as the total of interest income and amortized fees on earning assets, less interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds, adjusted for the impact of interest-related hedging activity. earning assets - including federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell, interest-bearing due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks, federal reserve deposits, securities, and loans and leases - are financed by a large base of interest-bearing funds that include client deposits, short-term borrowings, senior notes and long-term debt. earning assets also are funded by net noninterest-related funds, which include demand deposits, the allowance for credit losses, and stockholders' equity, reduced by nonearning assets such as noninterest-bearing cash and due from banks, items in process of collection, and buildings and equipment. net interest income is subject to variations in the level and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing funds and their relative sensitivity to interest rates. in addition, the levels of nonperforming assets and client compensating deposit balances used to pay for services impact net interest income.
net interest income in 2015 was $1.07 billion, up $64.6 million, or 6%, from $1.01 billion in 2014. net interest income on an fte basis for 2015 was $1.10 billion, an increase of $60.5 million, or 6%, from $1.03 billion in 2014. the increase is primarily attributable to higher levels of average earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in the net interest margin. average earning assets increased $6.3 billion, or 7%, to $102.2 billion from $95.9 billion in 2014, reflecting higher levels of securities and loans and leases. the net interest margin on an fte basis in 2015 was 1.07%, down from 1.08% in 2014. the net interest margin in 2015 reflects the impact of a $17.8 million impairment of the residual value of certain aircraft under leveraged lease agreements. excluding the impairment, the net interest margin was 1.09% in 2015.
growth in average earning assets primarily reflected increased securities and loans and leases, offset by a decrease in interest-bearing due from and deposits with banks. securities, inclusive of federal reserve and federal home loan bank stock and certain community development investments which are classified in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, averaged $37.4 billion, an increase of $4.0 billion, or 12%, from $33.4 billion in 2014. loans and leases averaged $33.0 billion, an increase of $2.8 billion, or 9%, from $30.2 billion in 2014. interest-bearing due from and deposits with banks averaged $15.7 billion in 2015, down $1.1 billion from $16.8 billion in 2014.
the increase in average earning assets was primarily funded by higher levels of demand and interest-bearing deposits. average demand deposits increased $4.9 billion, or 25%, to $24.5 billion in 2015 from $19.6 billion in 2014, while non-

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations u.s.-office interest-bearing client deposits averaged $49.4 billion in 2015, up $1.1 billion, or 2%, from $48.3 billion in 2014.
stockholders' equity averaged $8.6 billion in 2015 compared with $8.2 billion in 2014. the increase of $458.0 million, or 6%, primarily reflected current-year earnings, partially offset by dividend declarations and the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the corporation's share repurchase program. during the year ended december 31, 2015, the corporation increased its quarterly common stock dividend by 9% to $0.36 per share and repurchased 6.9 million shares, returning $829.9 million in capital to common stockholders, compared to $792.4 million in 2014. on august 5, 2014, the corporation issued 16,000 shares of preferred stock for proceeds of $388.5 million, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and other issuance costs.
under the corporation's capital plan submitted in january 2015, which was reviewed without objection by the federal reserve in march 2015, the corporation may repurchase up to $285.3 million of common stock after december 31, 2015, through june 2016.

net interest income - 2014 compared with 2013
net interest income on an fte basis increased 7% to $1.03 billion in 2014 from $965.6 million in 2013, primarily attributable to higher levels of average earning assets, partially offset by a decline in the net interest margin. the net interest margin in 2014 was 1.08%, down from 1.13% in 2013, primarily the result of lower yields on earning assets, partially offset by a lower cost of interest-related funds due to lower short-term interest rates.
average earning assets increased $10.3 billion, or 12%, to $95.9 billion in 2014 from $85.6 billion in 2013. growth in average earning assets primarily reflected a $7.1 billion, or 94%, increase in federal reserve deposits from 2013.
stockholders' equity averaged $8.2 billion and $7.7 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increase in 2014 reflected the retention of earnings and the issuance of preferred stock, partially offset by dividend declarations and the repurchase of common stock.
provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses was a credit of $43.0 million in 2015 compared with a provision of $6.0 million in 2014 and $20.0 million in 2013. the current-year provision primarily reflected improved credit quality across the portfolio coupled with the adoption of a change in estimation methodology for inherent losses. nonperforming assets at december 31, 2015 decreased 19% from the prior year-end. residential real estate and commercial loans accounted for 67% and 24%, respectively, of nonperforming loans and leases at december 31, 2015. for further discussion of the allowance and provision for credit losses for 2015, 2014, and 2013, refer to the "asset quality" section.
noninterest expense noninterest expense for 2015 totaled $3.28 billion, up $145.6 million, or 5%, from $3.14 billion in 2014. the current year includes a $45.8 million charge related to voluntary cash contributions to certain constant dollar nav funds, while results for 2014 include $47.5 million of charges and write-offs.

reporting segments and related information northern trust is organized around its two client-focused reporting segments: c&is and wealth management. asset management and related services are provided to c&is and wealth management clients primarily by the asset management business. the revenue and expenses of asset management and certain other support functions are allocated fully to c&is and wealth management. income and expense associated with the corporation's and the bank's wholesale funding activities and investment portfolios, as well as certain corporate-based expense, executive level compensation and nonrecurring items are not allocated to c&is and wealth management, and are reported in northern trust's third reporting segment, treasury and other, in the following pages.
c&is and wealth management results are presented to promote a greater understanding of their financial performance. the information, presented on an internal management-reporting basis, is derived from internal accounting systems that support northern trust's strategic objectives and management structure. management has developed accounting systems to allocate revenue and expense related to each segment. these systems incorporate processes for allocating assets, liabilities and equity, and the applicable interest income and expense. equity is allocated to the reporting segments based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, risk, regulatory considerations, and internal metrics. allocations of capital and certain corporate expense may not be representative of levels that would be required if the segments were independent entities. the accounting policies used for management reporting are consistent with those described in note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies," to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data." transfers of income and expense items are recorded at cost; there is no consolidated profit or loss on sales or transfers between reporting segments. northern trust's presentations are not necessarily consistent with similar information for other financial institutions.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations servicing fees and net interest income, partially offset by lower foreign exchange trading income and higher noninterest expense. in addition, 2015 and 2014 c&is net income included the income tax benefit related to northern trust's decision to reinvest the pre-tax earnings of a foreign subsidiary indefinitely outside the united states of $5.5 million and $9.5 million, respectively.
c&is trust, investment and other servicing fees c&is trust, investment and other servicing fees are primarily attributable to services related to custody, fund administration, investment management, and securities lending. custody and fund administration fees are driven primarily by values of client assets under custody/administration, transaction volumes, and number of accounts. the asset values used to calculate these fees vary depending on the individual fee arrangements negotiated with each client. custody fees related to asset values are client specific and are priced based on quarter-end or month-end values, values at the beginning of each quarter or average values for a month or quarter. the fund administration fees that are asset-value-related are priced using month-end, quarter-end, or average daily balances. investment management fees, which are based generally on client assets under management, are based primarily on market values throughout a period.
securities lending revenue is affected by market values; the demand for securities to be lent, which drives volumes; and the interest rate spread earned on the investment of cash deposited by investment firms as collateral for securities they have borrowed. the other services fee category in c&is includes such products as benefit payments, investment risk and analytical services and other services. revenue from these products is based generally on the volume of services provided or a fixed fee.
provided below are the components of c&is trust, investment and other servicing fees.

c&is foreign exchange trading income foreign exchange trading income totaled $249.4 million in 2015, a $49.0 million, or 24%, increase from $200.4 million in 2014. the increase is attributable to higher currency market volatility and trading volumes in the current year. foreign exchange trading income in 2014 of $200.4 million decreased $38.4 million, or 16%, from $238.8 million in 2013, due to lower currency market volatility and trading volumes as compared to 2013.
c&is other noninterest income other noninterest income for 2015 totaled $170.5 million, down $7.4 million, or 4%, from $177.9 million in 2014, primarily due to decreases within various categories of other operating income, partially offset by higher security commissions and trading income. other income in 2015 includes a $25.9 million net gain on the sale of certain loans and leases, offset by a $27.0 million fair value adjustment on leases classified as held for sale as of december 31, 2015, each of which is related to the decision to exit a portion of a non-strategic loan and lease portfolio. other noninterest income in 2013 of $177.3 million included a $6.6 million reduction in connection with the write-off of certain fee receivables.
c&is net interest income net interest income increased $104.4 million, or 34%, in 2015 to $414.4 million from $310.0 million in 2014. the increase in net interest income was attributable to an increase in the net interest margin, partially offset by lower levels of average earning assets. the changes to both the net interest margin and average earning assets compared to the prior-year period were partially due to a change in presentation, as certain assets were transferred to the treasury and other segment in the first quarter of 2015 and the related internal funds pricing method was updated. also impacting the net interest income in 2015 was a $17.8 million impairment of the residual value of certain aircraft under leveraged lease agreements. as a result, the net interest margin increased to 1.16% from 0.58% in the prior year, while average earning assets totaled $35.7 billion, a decrease of $17.3 billion, or 33%, from $53.0 billion in the prior year. the earning assets that remain consist primarily of loans and leases and intercompany assets. funding sources were primarily comprised of non-u.s. custody-related interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $46.0 billion in 2015, up from $45.5 billion in 2014. net interest income increased $34.1 million, or 12%, in 2014 to $310.0 million from $275.9 million in 2013, due to higher levels of average earning assets, partially offset by a decline in the net interest margin.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations c&is provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses in 2015 was a credit of $22.6 million, primarily reflecting improved credit quality across the portfolio coupled with the adoption of a change in estimation methodology for inherent losses. the change in methodology resulted in a decrease in the estimate for the allowance for credit losses for the commercial and institutional loan portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the allowance for undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit. the provision for credit losses was $5.8 million for 2014, primarily reflecting allowances established as a result of higher commercial and institutional loan volumes, partially offset by continued improvement in the credit quality of commercial and institutional loans. the provision for credit losses in 2013 was a credit of $3.4 million, reflecting improvement in loan portfolio credit quality as compared to the preceding year. for further discussion of the allowance and provision for credit losses refer to the "asset quality" section.
c&is noninterest expense total c&is noninterest expense, which includes the direct expense of the reporting segment, indirect expense allocations for product and operating support, and indirect expense allocations for certain corporate support services, totaled $1.86 billion in 2015, an increase of $123.6 million, or 7%, from $1.73 billion in 2014. the increase was due to higher indirect expense allocations, primarily attributable to $36.6 million of the charge related to voluntary cash contributions to certain constant dollar nav funds allocated to c&is, as well as higher outside services and compensation expense in 2015. noninterest expense for 2014 increased $74.9 million, or 5%, from $1.66 billion in 2013. results for 2014 included $24.8 million of charges relating to severance activities and reductions in office space and write-offs of replaced or eliminated software, while the 2013 results included a $19.2 million legal settlement charge.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
2015 wealth management assets under management by investment type n                  46% equities n   28% fixed income securities n     26% cash and other assets the wealth management regions shown above are comprised of the following: central includes illinois, michigan, minnesota, missouri, ohio and wisconsin; east includes connecticut, delaware, florida, georgia, massachusetts, new york and washington, d.c.; west includes arizona, california, colorado, nevada, texas and washington. global family office provides specialized asset management, investment consulting, global custody, fiduciary, and private banking services to ultra-wealthy domestic and international clients.
wealth management fee income is calculated primarily based on market values. wealth management trust, investment and other servicing fees were $1.28 billion in 2015, up $34.8 million, or 3%, from $1.25 billion in 2014, which in turn was up $82.8 million, or 7%, from $1.17 billion in 2013. the results in 2015 benefited from new business, higher equity markets and lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. wealth management money market mutual fund fee waivers totaled $60.4 million and $66.6 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. the 7% increase in trust, investment and other servicing fees in 2014 compared to 2013 was attributable to higher equity markets and new business, partially offset by higher money market mutual fund fee waivers.
at december 31, 2015, assets under custody in wealth management were $506.3 billion compared with $515.7 billion at december 31, 2014. assets under management were $227.3 billion at december 31, 2015 compared to $224.5 billion at the previous year end.
wealth management foreign exchange trading income foreign exchange trading income totaled $12.4 million in 2015, $9.7 million in 2014 and $5.6 million in 2013, primarily reflecting increased client activity.
wealth management other noninterest income other noninterest income for 2015 totaled $111.8 million, an increase of $13.5 million, or 14%, from $98.3 million in 2014, primarily reflecting higher security commissions and trading income and increases within various categories of other operating income. other noninterest income in 2014 increased $18.4 million, or 16%, as compared to 2013. noninterest income in 2013 included the $32.6 million pre-tax gain on the sale of an office building property and a $5.8 million reduction in connection with the write-off of certain fee receivables.
wealth management net interest income net interest income was $568.1 million for 2015, up $32.0 million, or 6%, from $536.1 million in 2014, primarily reflecting higher levels of average earning assets, partially offset by a decline in the net interest margin. the wealth management net interest margin in 2015 decreased to 2.29% from 2.32% in 2014, resulting from lower yields on earning assets, partially offset by a lower cost of interest-related funds. average earning assets totaled $24.8 billion in the current year, a 7% increase from $23.1 billion in the prior year. net interest income in 2014 declined $21.6 million, or 4%, from 2013 and the net interest margin in 2014 of 2.32% was down from the 2013 margin of 2.46%. the lower net interest margin in 2014 as compared to 2013 was attributable to lower yields on earning assets, partially offset by lower deposit rates. earning assets and funding sources in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were primarily comprised of loans and domestic interest-bearing deposits.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations wealth management provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses was a credit of $20.4 million for 2015, compared with a provision of $0.2 million in 2014, and $23.4 million in 2013. the 2015 provision primarily reflected improved credit quality of commercial real estate and residential real estate loan classes coupled with the adoption of a change in estimation methodology for inherent losses. the 2014 provision reflected improvement in the credit quality of the commercial and institutional and commercial real estate loan classes as compared to 2013. for further discussion of the allowance and provision for credit losses refer to the "asset quality" section.
wealth management noninterest expense total noninterest expense, which includes the direct expense of the reporting segment, indirect expense allocations for product and operating support, and indirect expense allocations for certain corporate support services, totaled $1.29 billion in 2015, an increase of $23.2 million, or 2%, from $1.27 billion in the prior year. the increase primarily reflected higher indirect allocations, primarily attributable to $9.2 million of the charge related to voluntary cash contributions to certain constant dollar nav funds allocated to wealth management, as well as increased employee benefits expense, partially offset by lower expense for outside services. noninterest expense in 2014 included $18.1 million of charges relating to severance activities and reductions in office space and write-offs of replaced or eliminated software.
treasury and other treasury and other includes income and expense associated with the wholesale funding activities and the investment portfolios of the corporation and the bank. treasury and other also includes certain corporate-based expense, executive level compensation and nonrecurring items not allocated to the reporting segments.

treasury and other noninterest income in 2015 was $107.9 million compared to $6.6 million in 2014. the increase reflects the $99.9 million gain on the sale of 1.0 million visa class b common shares recognized by the corporation during 2015. excluding the gain, treasury and other noninterest income increased slightly compared to 2014. noninterest income in 2014 decreased 17% from 2013, and included $4.2 million of otti charges related to certain cra-eligible securities.
treasury and other net interest income in 2015 was $112.9 million, down $75.9 million, or 40%, from $188.8 million in 2014. the decrease reflected a decline in the net interest margin, partially offset by higher levels of earning assets. the changes to both the net interest margin and average earning assets versus prior year are partially due to a change in presentation, as certain assets were transferred to treasury and other from c&is in the first quarter of 2015 and the related internal funds pricing method was updated. average earning assets in 2015 increased $22.0 billion to $41.8 billion from $19.8 billion in the prior year. net interest income in 2014 increased 43% from 2013, reflecting higher internal yields on funds provided to reporting segments in 2014.
treasury and other noninterest expense in 2015 equaled $132.3 million, down slightly from $133.5 million in 2014. the 2014 expense included $4.6 million of severance-related charges. excluding these charges, the $3.4 million, or 3%, increase is primarily attributable to higher general overhead costs, partially offset by higher indirect expense allocations to c&is and wealth management.

assets under management decreased $58.8 billion, or 6%, from $934.1 billion at year-end 2014. the decrease primarily reflected net outflows, including equity outflows from certain sovereign wealth fund clients and a significant outflow from one fixed income mandate, coupled with the unfavorable impact from equity markets and foreign currency translation. the following table presents activity in consolidated assets under management by investment type during the year-ended december 31, 2015.

residential real estate the residential real estate loan portfolio is primarily composed of mortgages and home equity credit lines provided as an accommodation to clients. residential real estate loans totaled $8.9 billion at december 31, 2015, or 28% of total u.s. loans, compared with $9.8 billion, or 32% of total u.s. loans, at december 31, 2014. all residential real estate loans are underwritten utilizing northern trust's credit policies, which do not support the origination of loan types generally considered to be of high risk in nature, such as option arm loans, subprime loans, loans with initial "teaser" rates, and loans with excessively high loan-to-value ratios. residential real estate loans consist of traditional first lien mortgages and equity credit lines that generally require a loan-to-collateral value of no more than 65% to 75% at inception. revaluations of supporting collateral for residential real estate loans are obtained upon refinancing or default or when otherwise considered warranted. residential real estate collateral revaluations are performed by independent third parties.
of the total $8.9 billion in residential real estate loans at december 31, 2015, $2.3 billion were in florida, $2.0 billion were in the greater chicago area, and $1.5 billion were in california, with the remainder distributed throughout the other geographic regions within the united states served by northern trust. legally binding commitments to extend residential real estate credit, which are primarily equity credit lines, totaled $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
commercial real estate in managing its credit exposure, management has defined a commercial real estate loan as one where: (1) the borrower's principal business activity is the acquisition or the development of real estate for commercial purposes; (2) the principal collateral is real estate held for commercial purposes, and loan repayment is expected to flow from the operation of the property; or (3) the loan repayment is expected to flow from the sale or refinance of real estate as a normal and ongoing part of the business. unsecured lines of credit to firms or individuals engaged in commercial real estate endeavors are included without regard to the use of loan proceeds. the commercial real estate portfolio consists of commercial mortgages and construction, acquisition and development loans extended primarily to highly experienced developers and/or investors well known to northern trust. underwriting standards generally reflect conservative loan-to-value ratios and debt service coverage requirements. recourse to borrowers through guarantees also is commonly required.
commercial mortgage financing is provided for the acquisition or refinancing of income-producing properties. cash flows from the properties generally are sufficient to amortize the loan. these loans are primarily located in the illinois, florida, california, texas, and arizona markets. construction, acquisition and development loans provide financing for commercial real estate prior to rental income stabilization. the intent is generally that the borrower will sell the project or refinance the loan through a commercial mortgage with northern trust or another financial institution upon completion.

the provision for credit losses is the charge to current period earnings that is determined by management, through a disciplined credit review process, to be the amount needed to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb probable credit losses that have been identified with specific borrower relationships (specific loss component) and for probable losses that are believed to be inherent in the loan and lease portfolios, undrawn commitments, and standby letters of credit (inherent loss component).

specific component of the allowance: the amount of specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lending-related commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows, collateral value, and other factors that may impact the borrower's ability to pay.
at december 31, 2015, the specific allowance component amounted to $3.1 million compared with $21.1 million at the end of 2014. the $18.0 million decrease is primarily attributable to charge-offs and restructurings and pay-offs as a result of improvement in commercial and institutional, commercial real estate and residential real estate loans.
the decrease in the specific component of the allowance from $24.9 million in 2013 to $21.1 million in 2014 was primarily attributable to a decrease in nonperforming loans attributable to restructurings and pay-offs as a result of improvement in commercial and institutional, commercial real estate and residential real estate loans, partially offset by additional allowances provided for new and existing nonperforming loans.
inherent component of the allowance: the inherent component of the allowance addresses exposure relating to probable but unidentified credit-related losses. the inherent component of the allowance also covers the credit exposure associated with undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit. to estimate the allowance for credit losses on

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations these instruments, management uses conversion rates to determine the estimated amount that will be drawn and assigns an allowance factor determined in accordance with the methodology utilized for outstanding loans.
the inherent portion of the allowance decreased $44.6 million to $230.2 million at december 31, 2015, compared with $274.8 million at december 31, 2014, which decreased $8.2 million from $283.0 million at december 31, 2013.
the decrease in 2015 was driven by improved credit quality across the loan and lease portfolio. in addition, northern trust changed the estimation methodology for the calculation of the inherent component of the allowance as of december 31, 2015. see allowance for credit losses in critical accounting estimates on page 56 for a description of the change in estimation methodology. the adoption of this methodology resulted in a reduction in the commercial and institutional allowance requirement, which was partially offset by an increase to the allowance assigned to undrawn commitments and standby letters of credit. the adoption of the new estimation methodology did not have a material impact on the estimated reserve for any other presented loan categories. the decrease in 2014 was primarily attributable to improvement in the credit quality of commercial real estate, residential real estate and commercial and institutional loans in certain markets, partially offset by additional allowances established for increased loan volumes in the commercial and institutional and commercial real estate loan classes.
overall allowance: the evaluation of the specific component and the inherent component above resulted in a total allowance for credit losses of $233.3 million at december 31, 2015, compared with $295.9 million at the end of 2014. the allowance of $193.8 million assigned to loans and leases, as a percentage of total loans and leases, was 0.58% at december 31, 2015, down from a $267.0 million allowance, representing 0.84% of total loans and leases, at december 31, 2014. allowances assigned to undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit totaled $39.5 million and $28.9 million at december 31, 2015, and december 31, 2014, respectively, and are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
provision: the provision for credit losses was a credit of $43.0 million and net charge-offs totaled $19.5 million in 2015. this compares with a $6.0 million provision for credit losses and net charge-offs of $18.0 million in 2014, and a $20.0 million provision for credit losses and net charge-offs of $39.7 million in 2013.
impaired loans a loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when its terms have been modified as a concession resulting from the debtor's financial difficulties, referred to as a troubled debt restructuring. as of december 31, 2015, impaired loans totaled $157.3 million and included $117.1 million of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings as compared to total impaired loans of $242.2 million at december 31, 2014, which included $151.3 million of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings. impaired loans had $3.1 million and $6.6 million of the allowance for credit losses allocated to them at december 31, 2015, and december 31, 2014, respectively. impaired loans are measured based upon the loan's market price, the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. if the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan, dependent upon the level of certainty of loss, either a specific allowance is established or a charge-off is recorded for the difference. smaller balance (individually less than $1 million as of december 31, 2015) homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and excluded from impaired loan disclosures as allowed under applicable accounting standards.
critical accounting estimates the use of estimates and assumptions is required in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap and actual results could differ from those estimates. the sec has issued guidance relating to the disclosure of critical accounting estimates. critical accounting estimates are those that require management to make subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. changes that may be required in the underlying assumptions or estimates in these areas could have a material impact on northern trust's future financial condition and results of operations.
for northern trust, accounting estimates that are viewed as critical are those relating to the allowance for credit losses, pension plan accounting, and otti of investment securities. management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of the board of directors (audit committee).

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. the loan and lease portfolio and other lending-related credit exposures are regularly reviewed to evaluate the level of the allowance for credit losses. in determining an appropriate allowance level, northern trust evaluates the allowance necessary for impaired loans and lending-related commitments and also estimates losses inherent in other lending-related credit exposures.
the allowance for credit losses consists of the following components:
specific allowance: the specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lending-related commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows, collateral value, and other factors that may impact the borrower's ability to pay. for impaired loans where the amount of specific allowance, if any, is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral, third-party appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management. these appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect management's judgment as to the realizable value of the collateral.
inherent allowance: as of december 31, 2015, northern trust changed the estimation methodology for inherent losses that have been incurred in the loan and lease portfolio. the new estimation methodology is more quantitatively focused than the previous methodology as it is based on internally developed loss data specific to the northern trust loan and lease portfolio. the change in methodology is accounted for as a change in estimate applicable to current period and future periods. the new estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment framework segregate the loan and lease portfolio into homogeneous segments. for each segment, the probability of default and the loss given default are applied to the total exposure at default to determine a quantitative inherent allowance. the estimated allowance is reviewed by the loan loss reserve committee within a qualitative adjustment framework to determine an appropriate adjustment to the quantitative inherent allowance for each segment of the loan portfolio. in determining the appropriate adjustment, management applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors, potential limitations in the quantitative methodology and environmental factors that are not contemplated in the quantitative methodology. the loan loss reserve committee is comprised of representatives from credit risk management, the reporting segments and corporate finance.
for periods prior to the methodology change, the amount of inherent allowance was based on factors that incorporated management's evaluation of historical charge-off experience and various qualitative factors such as management's evaluation of economic and business conditions and changes in the character and size of the loan portfolio. factors were applied to loan and lease credit exposures aggregated by shared risk characteristics and were reviewed quarterly by the loan loss reserve committee.
the quarterly analysis of the specific and inherent allowance components and the control process maintained by credit risk management and the lending staff are the principal methods relied upon by management for the timely identification of, and adjustment for, changes in estimated credit loss levels. in addition to northern trust's own experience, management also considers regulatory guidance. control processes and analyses employed to determine an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are reviewed on at least an annual basis and modified as considered appropriate.
loans, leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses. subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. determinations as to whether loan balances for which the collectability is in question are charged-off or a specific reserve is established based on management's assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of loss. the provision for credit losses, which is charged to income, is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level deemed to be appropriate through the above process. actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be either greater than or less than actual net charge-offs.
management's estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption. management evaluates numerous variables, many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates, in determining an appropriate allowance level. due to the inherent imprecision in accounting estimates, other estimates or assumptions could reasonably have been used in 2015 and changes in estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period.
additionally, as an integral part of their examination process, various federal and state regulatory agencies also review the allowance for credit losses. these agencies may require that certain loan balances be classified differently or charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. however, management believes that the allowance for credit losses adequately addresses these uncertainties and has been established at an appropriate level to cover probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pension plan accounting northern trust maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all u.s. employees (the qualified plan) and a u.s. noncontributory supplemental pension plan (the nonqualified plan). certain european-based employees also retain benefits in local defined benefit pension plans which are closed to new employees and to future benefit accruals. measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of several assumptions regarding future interest rates, asset returns, compensation increases, mortality rates, and other actuarial-based projections relating to the plans. due to the long-term nature of this obligation and the estimates that are required to be made, the assumptions used in determining the periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation are closely monitored and reviewed annually for adjustments that may be required. pension accounting guidance requires that differences between estimates and actual experience be recognized as other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. the differences are amortized into net periodic pension expense from accumulated other comprehensive income over the future working lifetime of eligible participants. as a result, differences between the estimates made in the calculation of periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation and actual experience affect stockholders' equity in the period in which they occur but continue to be recognized as expense systematically and gradually over subsequent periods.
northern trust recognizes the significant impact that these pension-related assumptions have on the determination of the pension obligations and related expense and has established procedures for monitoring and setting these assumptions each year. these procedures include an annual review of actual demographic and investment experience with the pension plans' actuaries. in addition to actual experience, adjustments to these assumptions consider observable yields on fixed income securities, known compensation trends and policies, as well as economic conditions and investment strategies that may impact the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets.
in determining the pension expense for the u.s. plans in 2015, northern trust utilized a discount rate of 4.25% for both the qualified plan and the nonqualified plan. the rate of increase in the compensation level is based on a sliding scale that averaged 4.25%. the expected long-term rate of return on qualified plan assets was 7.25%.
in evaluating possible revisions to pension-related assumptions for the u.s. plans as of northern trust's december 31, 2015 measurement date, the following were considered:
•   discount rate: effective december 31, 2015, northern trust estimates the discount rate for its u.s. pension plans by applying the projected cash flows for future benefit payments to the aon hewitt aa above median yield curve as of the measurement date. this yield curve is composed of individual zero-coupon interest rates for 198 different time periods over a 99-year time horizon. zero-coupon rates utilized by the yield curve are mathematically derived from observable market yields for aa-rated corporate bonds. this yield curve model referenced by northern trust in establishing the discount rate resulted in a rate of 4.71% at december 31, 2015 for the qualified and nonqualified plans, an increase from 4.25% at december 31, 2014.
•   compensation level: based on a review of actual and anticipated salary experience, the compensation scale assumption is based on a sliding scale that averages 4.25%.
•   rate of return on plan assets: the expected return on plan assets is based on an estimate of the long-term (30 years) rate of return on plan assets, which is determined using a building block approach that considers the current asset mix and estimates of return by asset class based on historical experience, giving proper consideration to diversification and rebalancing. current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are also evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness. as a result of these analyses, northern trust's rate of return assumption decreased from 7.25% for 2015 to 7.00% for 2016.
•   mortality table: northern trust uses the mortality table proposed by the u.s. treasury for use in accordance with the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006 (ppa) for both pre- and post-retirement mortality assumptions. effective december 31, 2015, northern trust changed from the rp-2014 mortality table with improvement scale mp-2014 to the aggregate rp-2014 mortality table with adjustment from 2006 to 2014 to reflect improvement scale mp-2015, and with future improvement under scale mp-2015 released by the society of actuaries in october 2015. the updated mortality table and improvement scale apply to annuity payments only and result in generally lower projected mortality improvements than estimated by the 2014 tables. mortality assumptions on lump sum payments remain static and continue to be in line with the irs prescribed table for minimum lump sums in 2016.

pension contributions: the deduction limits specified by the internal revenue code for contributions made by sponsors of defined benefit pension plans are based on a "target liability" under the provisions of the ppa. there were no contributions to the qualified plan in 2015 and 2014 due to strong asset performance over the past few years. the minimum required contribution to the qualified plan is expected to be zero in 2016. the maximum deductible contribution is estimated at $250 million for 2016.
other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities under gaap, companies are required to perform periodic reviews of securities with unrealized losses to determine whether the declines in value are considered other-than-temporary. for available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities that management has no intent to sell, and believes it more-likely-than-not that it will not be required to sell, prior to recovery, the consolidated statements of income reflect only the credit loss component of an impairment, while the remainder of the fair value loss is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. the credit loss component recognized in earnings is identified as the amount of principal not expected to be received over the remaining term of the security as projected. for debt securities that northern trust intends to sell, or would more-likely-than-not be required to sell, before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis, the full impairment (that is, the difference between the security's amortized cost basis and fair value) is recognized in earnings. the application of significant judgment is required in determining the assumptions used in assessing whether otti exists and, if so, in the calculation of the credit loss component of the otti. assumptions used in this process are inherently subject to change in future periods. different judgments or subsequent changes in estimates could result in materially different impairment loss recognition.
northern trust conducts security impairment reviews quarterly to identify and evaluate those securities within its investment portfolio that have indications of possible otti. a determination as to whether a security's decline in market value is other-than-temporary takes into consideration numerous factors and the relative significance of any single factor can vary by security. factors northern trust considers in determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary include, but are not limited to, the length of time the security has been impaired; the severity of the impairment; the cause of the impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; activity in the market of the issuer which may indicate adverse credit conditions; northern trust's intent regarding the sale of the security as of the balance sheet date; and the likelihood that it will not be required to sell the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of the security's amortized cost basis.
there were no credit-related losses recognized in 2015 or 2013. credit-related losses recognized in 2014 in connection with the write-down of securities totaled $4.2 million. additional otti may occur in future periods as a result of market and economic conditions.
fair value measurements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires certain assets and liabilities to be reported at fair value. as of december 31, 2015, approximately 29% of northern trust's total assets and approximately 1% of its total liabilities were carried on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. as discussed more fully in note 3, "fair value measurements," to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data," gaap requires entities to categorize financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value according to a three-level valuation hierarchy. the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted, active market prices for identical assets and

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation techniques that require significant management judgment because one or more of the significant inputs are unobservable in the market place (level 3). approximately 18% of northern trust's assets carried at fair value are classified as level 1; northern trust typically does not hold equity securities or other instruments that are actively traded on an exchange.
approximately 82% of northern trust's assets and 99% of its liabilities carried at fair value are categorized as level 2, as they are valued using models in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets. investment securities classified as available for sale make up 95% of level 2 assets with the remaining 5% primarily consisting of derivative financial instruments. level 2 liabilities are comprised solely of derivative financial instruments.
northern trust's level 2 assets include available for sale and trading account securities, the fair values of which are determined predominantly by external pricing vendors. northern trust has a well-established process to validate prices received from pricing vendors as discussed more fully in note 3, "fair value measurements," to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
as of december 31, 2015, all derivative assets and liabilities, excluding the swap related to the sale of certain visa class b common shares described below, were classified in level 2 and approximately 97%, measured on a notional value basis, related to client-related and trading activities, predominantly consisting of foreign exchange contracts. derivative instruments are valued internally using widely accepted income-based models that incorporate inputs readily observable in actively quoted markets and reflect contractual terms of contracts. northern trust evaluated the impact of counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk on the valuation of derivative instruments. factors considered included the likelihood of default by northern trust and its counterparties, the remaining maturities of the instruments, net exposures after giving effect to master netting agreements, available collateral, and other credit enhancements in determining the appropriate fair value of derivative instruments. the resulting valuation adjustments are not considered material.
as of december 31, 2015, the fair value of northern trust's level 3 assets were $17.1 million. level 3 assets consist of auction rate securities purchased from northern trust clients. to estimate the fair value of auction rate securities, for which trading is limited and market prices are generally unavailable, northern trust developed and maintains a pricing model that discounts estimated cash flows over their estimated remaining lives. significant inputs to the model include the contractual terms of the securities, credit risk ratings, discount rates, forward interest rates, credit/liquidity spreads, and northern trust's own assumptions about the estimated remaining lives of the securities.
as of december 31, 2015, northern trust's level 3 liabilities consisted of a swap that northern trust entered into with the purchaser of 1.0 million shares of visa class b common shares previously held by northern trust. pursuant to the swap, northern trust retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the visa class b common shares into shares of visa inc. class a common stock (visa class a common shares), such that the counterparty will be compensated for any dilutive adjustments to the conversion ratio and northern trust will be compensated for any anti-dilutive adjustments to the ratio. the swap also requires periodic payments from northern trust to the counterparty calculated by reference to the market price of visa class a common shares and a fixed rate of interest. the fair value of the swap is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are northern trust's own assumptions about estimated changes in the conversion rate of the visa class b common shares into visa class a common shares, the date on which such conversion is expected to occur and the estimated growth rate of the visa class a common share price. see "visa class b common shares" under note 24, "contingent liabilities," provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data," of this annual report on form 10-k for further information.
while northern trust believes its valuation methods for its assets and liabilities carried at fair value are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions, particularly as applied to level 3 assets, could have a material effect on the computation of their estimated fair values.
implementation of accounting standards information related to recent accounting pronouncements is contained in note 2, "recent accounting pronouncements," to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
capital expenditures.
capital expenditures in 2015 included ongoing enhancements to northern trust's software and hardware capabilities, the opening of new offices, and the expansion and renovation of several existing offices. capital expenditures for 2015 totaled $433.5 million, of which $335.0 million was for software, $59.2 million was for computer hardware, $34.2 million was for building and leasehold improvements, and $5.1 million was for furnishings. these capital expenditures principally support

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and enhance northern trust's investment management, asset servicing and asset management capabilities, as well as relationship management and client interaction. additional capital expenditures planned for systems technology will result in future expense for the depreciation of hardware and amortization of software. software amortization and depreciation on computer hardware and machinery are charged to equipment and software expense. depreciation on building and leasehold improvements and on furnishings is charged to occupancy expense and equipment expense, respectively. capital expenditures for 2014 totaled $409.5 million, of which $327.6 million was for software, $42.2 million was for computer hardware, $31.6 million was for building and leasehold improvements, and $8.1 million was for furnishings.
off-balance-sheet arrangements assets under custody/administration and assets under management northern trust, in the normal course of business, holds assets under custody/administration and management in a fiduciary or agency capacity for its clients. in accordance with gaap, these assets are not assets of northern trust and are not included in its consolidated balance sheets.
commitments, letters of credit and securities lent with indemnification northern trust, in the normal course of business, enters into various types of commitments and issues letters of credit to meet the liquidity and credit enhancement needs of its clients. the contractual amounts of these instruments represent the potential credit exposure should the instrument be drawn fully upon and the client default. to control the credit risk associated with entering into commitments and issuing letters of credit, northern trust subjects such activities to the same credit quality and monitoring controls as its lending activities. the following table provides details of northern trust's off-balance-sheet financial instruments as of december 31, 2015 and 2014.

standby letters of credit obligate northern trust to meet certain financial obligations of its clients, if, under the contractual terms of the agreement, the clients are unable to do so. these instruments are primarily issued to support public and private financial commitments, including commercial paper, bond financing, initial margin requirements on futures exchanges and similar transactions. northern trust is obligated to meet the entire financial obligation of these agreements and in certain cases is able to recover the amounts paid through recourse against collateral received or other participants. standby letters of credit of $4.3 billion and $4.5 billion at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, include $147.1 million and $221.4 million, respectively, of standby letters of credit secured by cash deposits or participated to others. the weighted average maturity of standby letters of credit was 24 and 27 months at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
as part of its securities custody activities and at the direction of its clients, northern trust lends securities owned by clients to borrowers who are reviewed and approved by the northern trust counterparty risk management committee. in connection with these activities, northern trust has issued indemnifications to certain clients against certain losses that are a direct result of a borrower's failure to return securities when due, should the value of such securities exceed the value of the collateral required to be posted. borrowers are required to collateralize fully securities received with cash or marketable securities. as securities are loaned, collateral is maintained at a minimum of 100% of the fair value of the securities plus accrued interest. the collateral is revalued on a daily basis. the amount of securities loaned subject to indemnification was $94.5 billion and $98.1 billion at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. because of the credit quality of the borrowers
2015 annual report / northern trust corporation     61
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the requirement to collateralize fully securities borrowed, management believes that the exposure to credit loss from this activity is not significant and no liability was recorded at december 31, 2015, or 2014 related to these indemnifications.
additional information about northern trust's off-balance-sheet financial instruments is included in note 27, "off-balance-sheet financial instruments," to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
variable interest entities variable interest entities (vies) are defined within gaap as entities which either have a total equity investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. investors that finance a vie through debt or equity interests, or other counterparties that provide other forms of support, such as guarantees, subordinated fee arrangements, or certain types of derivative contracts, are variable interest holders in the entity and the variable interest holder, if any, that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity and a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the entity is deemed to be the vie's primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the vie.
leveraged leases. in leveraged leasing transactions, northern trust acts as lessor of the underlying asset subject to the lease and typically funds 20-30% of the asset's cost via an equity ownership in a trust with the remaining 70-80% provided by third party non-recourse debt holders. in such transactions, the trusts, which are vies, are created to provide the lessee use of the property with substantially all of the rights and obligations of ownership. the lessee's maintenance and operation of the leased property has a direct effect on the fair value of the underlying property, and the lessee also has the ability to increase the benefits it can receive and limit the losses it can suffer by the manner in which it uses the property. as a result, northern trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these vies given it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the vies.
tax credit structures. northern trust invests in qualified affordable housing projects and community development entities (collectively, community development projects) that are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of tax credits. these community development projects are formed as limited partnerships and llcs in which northern trust typically invests as a limited partner/investor member through equity contributions. the economic performance of the community development projects, which are vies, is subject to the performance of their underlying investments and their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. northern trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of any community development projects as it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the underlying investments or to affect their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. this power is held by the general partners and managing members who exercise full and exclusive control of the operations of the vies.
investment funds. northern trust acts as asset manager for various funds in which clients of northern trust are investors. as an asset manager of funds, the corporation earns a competitively priced fee that is based on assets managed and varies with each fund's investment objective. based on its analysis, northern trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these vies under gaap.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity risk management the objectives of liquidity risk management are to ensure that northern trust can meet its cash flow obligations under both normal and adverse economic conditions while maintaining its ability to act on business opportunities in a timely and cost effective manner. liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to raise sufficient funds or maintain collateral to meet on- and off-balance sheet and contingent liability cash flow obligations when due because of firm-specific or market-wide events.
governance and risk management framework northern trust manages its liquidity under a global risk management framework, incorporating regional policies, limits and management when appropriate. the corporate liquidity management policy, as well as corporate liquidity procedures, limits and risk appetite, are reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors. the board receives a semiannual update on the corporation's operations in accordance with established liquidity limits. the business risk committee receives reports at least quarterly on the corporation's liquidity risk profile and liquidity risk tolerance. additionally, the
2015 annual report / northern trust corporation     62
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset & liability management committee (alco) is responsible for recommending liquidity policies to the board, establishing internal liquidity thresholds, assessing northern trust's overall liquidity status, and reviewing reports, including liquidity stress test results, cash flows and other analyses on a regular basis. the treasury department has the day-to-day responsibility for measuring, analyzing and managing liquidity risk within the thresholds and limits established by alco and the board. the risk management function independently reviews and challenges the liquidity management process.
northern trust's global liquidity management framework focuses on five key areas - position management; liquidity analysis; contingency planning; peer group comparisons; and management reporting - while also providing for the review and management of the liquidity of the corporation separate from that of the bank. it is through this framework that management monitors its sources and uses of liquidity, evaluates their level of stability under various circumstances, plans for adverse situations, benchmarks itself against other banks, provides information to management, and complies with various u.s. and international regulations.
position management includes daily monitoring of cash positions, anticipating future funding requirements given both internal and external events, and management of the liquidity coverage ratio. as the corporation's principal subsidiary encompassing all of northern trust's banking activities, the bank centrally manages liquidity for all u.s. and international banking operations. liquidity is provided by a variety of sources, including client deposits (institutional and personal) from the c&is and wealth management businesses, wholesale funding from the capital markets, maturities of short-term investments, federal home loan bank advances, and unencumbered liquid assets that can be sold or pledged to secure additional funds. while management does not view central bank discount windows as primary sources of liquidity, at december 31, 2015, the bank had over $35.4 billion of securities and loans readily available as collateral to support discount window borrowings. the bank is also active in the u.s. interbank funding market, providing an important source of additional liquidity and low-cost funds. liquidity supports a variety of activities, including client withdrawals, purchases of securities, net loan growth, and draws on commitments to extend credit. northern trust maintains a very liquid balance sheet, with cash and due from banks, deposits with the federal reserve and other central banks, short-term money market assets and investment securities in aggregate representing 65% of total assets as of december 31, 2015. the market value of unencumbered securities at the bank, which include those placed at the federal reserve discount window, totaled $33.3 billion at december 31, 2015. the corporation believes that it and the bank each satisfied the fully phased-in monthly u.s. liquidity coverage ratio requirements during 2015.
liquidity analysis evaluates a bank's ability to meet its cash flow obligations given a variety of possible internal and external events and under different economic conditions. northern trust uses liquidity analysis to support its contingent liquidity plans, size its liquidity buffer, gain insight into its liquidity position and strengthen its liquidity and management practices. liquidity analysis is performed using multiple independent scenarios, across major currencies, at a consolidated corporate level and for various international banking subsidiaries. these scenarios, which include both company-specific and systemic events, analyze potential impacts on northern trust's domestic and foreign deposit balances, wholesale funding sources, financial market access, external borrowing capacity and off-balance-sheet obligations. results are reviewed by senior management and alco on a regular basis.
another important area of northern trust's liquidity risk management is the development and maintenance of contingent liquidity plans. a contingent funding plan covering the corporation, bank and major subsidiaries is approved annually by the business risk committee and regularly updated and tested. this plan, which can be activated in the event of an actual liquidity crisis, details organizational responsibilities and defines specific actions designed to ensure the proper maintenance of liquidity during periods of stress. in conjunction with northern trust's global contingent funding plan, international banking subsidiaries also have individual contingent liquidity plans.
northern trust analyzes its liquidity profile against a peer group of large u.s. bank holding companies, including other major custody banks. this analysis provides management with benchmarking information, highlights industry trends, and supports the establishment of new strategies.
management regularly reviews various reports, analyses and other information depicting changes in northern trust's liquidity mix and funding concentrations, overall financial market conditions and other internal and external liquidity metrics. management uses this information to evaluate the overall status of northern trust's liquidity position and anticipate potential events that could stress that position in the future. an overall liquidity status level for northern trust, established and regularly reviewed by alco, is monitored on an ongoing basis by the treasury department. downgrades in liquidity status resulting from internal, external or industry-wide events, trigger specific pre-determined actions and limits designed to position northern trust to respond better to potential liquidity stresses.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corporation liquidity the liquidity of the corporation is managed separately from that of the bank. the primary sources of cash for the corporation are issuances of debt or equity, dividend payments from the bank and interest earned on investment securities and money market assets. in 2015, the corporation received $600.0 million of dividends from the bank. dividends from the bank are subject to certain restrictions, as discussed in further detail in note 30, "restrictions on subsidiary dividends and loans or advances," to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data." the corporation's uses of cash consist mainly of dividend payments to the corporation's stockholders; the payment of principal and interest to note holders; repurchases of its common stock; and investments in, or loans to, its subsidiaries. the most significant uses of cash by the corporation during 2015 were $496.9 million of common stock repurchases and $321.4 million of common stock dividends.
the corporation's liquidity, defined as the amount of cash and highly marketable assets, was $757.5 million and $869.4 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. during, and at year-end, 2015 and 2014, these assets were comprised almost entirely of cash in a demand deposit account at the bank or overnight money market placements, both of which were fully available to the corporation to support its own cash flow requirements or those of its subsidiaries, as needed. average liquidity during 2015 and 2014 was $846.2 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. the cash flows of the corporation are shown in note 33, "northern trust corporation (corporation only)," to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
a significant source of liquidity for both the corporation and the bank is the ability to draw funding from capital markets globally. the credit ratings of the corporation and the bank as of december 31, 2015, provided below, allow northern trust to access capital markets on favorable terms.

statements of cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion, primarily the result of period earnings, decreased net collateral deposited with counterparties and the impact of non-cash charges such as amortization of computer software, partially offset by other operating activities.
2015 annual report / northern trust corporation     64
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2014, was $936.0 million and was primarily the result of period earnings and the impact of non-cash charges such as amortization of computer software, partially offset by increased net collateral deposited with derivative counterparties.
net cash used in investing activities of $6.9 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily reflects the strategic net purchases of securities available for sale and held to maturity to increase the yield on earning assets and increased loans and leases net of $585.2 million in gross cash proceeds received related to the decision to exit a non-strategic loan and lease portfolio, partially offset by decreased levels of federal reserve deposits.
net cash used in investing activities of $8.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014, was primarily attributable to increased levels of federal reserve deposits, net purchases of securities held to maturity and available for sale, and increased levels of loans and leases, partially offset by decreased levels of interest-bearing deposits with banks. the net increase in investment securities and the decrease in interest-bearing deposits with banks primarily reflected the redeployment of investments in bank time deposits to securities. the increase in federal reserve deposits primarily reflected increases in demand and other noninterest-bearing client deposits in 2014.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities totaled $8.5 billion, primarily attributable to higher levels of total deposits and strategic increases in short-term other borrowings with the federal home loan bank, partially offset by federal funds purchased, the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the corporation's share repurchase program, dividends paid on common and preferred stock, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and the repayment of sterling denominated notes. the increase in total deposits is primarily attributable to higher levels of non-u.s. office deposits.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities totaled $7.1 billion, primarily attributable to increased levels of total deposits and proceeds from the issuance of series c preferred stock, partially offset by repayments of senior notes and other long-term debt, the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the corporation's share repurchase program, and cash dividends paid to common stockholders. the increase in total deposits was attributable to higher levels of demand and other noninterest-bearing client deposits. the decrease in senior notes and other long-term debt reflect the maturity of $500.0 million of fixed-rate senior notes and $135.0 million of repayments of borrowing from the federal home loan bank, respectively.
regulatory environment northern trust actively follows regulatory developments and regularly evaluates its liquidity risk management framework against proposed rulemaking and industry best practices in order to comply with applicable regulations and further enhance its liquidity policies. please refer to "liquidity standards" under "supervision and regulation" in item 1, "business," of this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of applicable liquidity standards.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital management one of northern trust's primary objectives is to maintain a strong capital position to merit the confidence of clients, counterparties, creditors, regulators and stockholders. a strong capital position helps northern trust execute its strategies and withstand unforeseen adverse developments.
senior management, with oversight from the capital governance committee and the full board of directors, is responsible for capital management and planning. northern trust manages its capital on a total corporation basis and on a legal entity basis. the capital committee is responsible for measuring and managing capital levels against levels set forth within the capital policy approved by the board of directors. in establishing the goals and targets for capital, a variety of factors are taken into consideration, including the unique risk profiles of northern trust's businesses, regulatory requirements, capital levels relative to peers, and the impact on credit ratings.
capital levels were strengthened in 2015 as average stockholders' equity increased $458.0 million, or 6%, reaching $8.6 billion. total stockholders' equity was $8.7 billion at december 31, 2015, as compared to $8.4 billion at december 31, 2014. in april 2015, the board increased the quarterly common stock dividend by 9% to $0.36 per common share. common dividends totaling $333.0 million were declared in 2015. the corporation purchased 6.9 million shares of its common stock in 2015 at an average price per share of $72.52, and is authorized by the board to purchase up to 9.7 million additional shares of stock after december 31, 2015. preferred dividends totaling $23.4 million were declared in 2015.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations behavior by participants. the capital governance committee of the board was established in november 2015 to assist the board in discharging its oversight duties with respect to capital management and planning activities. among other responsibilities, the capital governance committee oversees northern trust's capital adequacy assessments, forecasting, and stress testing processes and activities, including the annual ccar exercise. accordingly, the capital governance committee provides oversight with respect to northern trust's risk identification for the capital adequacy assessment process.
the chief risk officer (cro) oversees northern trust's management of risk, promotes risk awareness and fosters a proactive risk management environment wherein risks inherent in the business strategy are understood and appropriately monitored and mitigated. the cro reports directly to the business risk committee and the corporation's chief executive officer. the cro regularly advises the business risk committee and reports to the committee at least quarterly on risk exposures, risk management deficiencies and emerging risks. in accordance with the enterprise risk management framework, the executive management team of northern trust, together with the general auditor, meets as the global enterprise risk committee (gerc) to provide executive management oversight and guidance with respect to the management of the categories of risk overseen by the business risk committee. among other risk management responsibilities, gerc receives reports or recommendations from senior risk committees that are responsible for the management of risk, and from time to time may delegate responsibility to such committees for risk issues. senior risk committees include:
the global enterprise risk management committee (germ) provides senior management oversight and guidance to the management of all categories of risk within northern trust. germ is chaired by the cro, and members include risk practice leads, business unit and regional chief risk officers, and various functional risk leaders.
the credit risk committee establishes and monitors credit-related policies and practices throughout northern trust and promotes their uniform application. the credit risk committee is chaired by the chief credit officer, and members include the cro, the treasurer, the chief operational risk officer, the controller, and various functional risk and business management leaders.
the operational risk committee (orc) provides independent oversight and is responsible for setting the corporate operational risk management policy and developing the operational risk management framework and programs that support the coordination of operational risk activities to identify, monitor, measure, manage and report on operational risk. at orc, senior management reviews and discusses operational risks including existing and emerging issues. the orc also is responsible for coordinating operational risk issues related to compliance and fiduciary risks.
the fiduciary risk committee (frc) is responsible for establishing and reviewing the fiduciary risk policies and establishing the fiduciary risk framework, governance and programs that support the coordination of fiduciary risk activities to identify, monitor, manage and report on fiduciary risk. at frc, senior management reviews and discusses fiduciary risks including existing and emerging issues.
the compliance & ethics oversight committee provides oversight and direction with respect to compliance policies, implementation of the compliance and ethics program, and the coordination of regulatory compliance initiatives across the corporation. this committee also may resolve significant interpretive issues regarding compliance in situations where specific compliance policies do not provide for or allow resolution of the issue by another individual or committee.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to the aforementioned committees, northern trust deploys business and regional risk committees that also report into gerc.
risk identification and risk management process northern trust utilizes a risk classification system called the "risk universe" to identify and classify the risks that it inherently faces. the risk universe forms the basis of common risk language and provides a consistent framework for the definition and categorization of risk and the organization of risk management activities. the risk universe supports risk management at all levels and enables risks to be clearly and consistently identified, categorized, assessed, managed and reported to line management, corporate risk and committees.
as part of the integrated enterprise risk framework, northern trust has established four key processes as described below.
risk appetite: northern trust defines the organization's risk appetite as the amount and types of risk that it is willing to assume in its exposures and business activities to achieve its strategic and financial objectives. risk appetite is a methodology to measure northern trust's willingness to take risk and reflects northern trust's tolerance of certain levels of risk exposures as measured at the enterprise and business level, as applicable. northern trust's corporate risk appetite statement reflects northern trust's expectation that risk is consciously considered as part of day-to-day activities and strategic decisions. northern trust manages its business activities consistent with the risk appetite statement, in which specific guidelines are detailed for credit, operational, fiduciary, compliance, market, liquidity, and strategic risk. gerc reviews the measurement and assessment of risk within the corporation and against northern trust's corporate risk appetite statement. when appropriate, gerc addresses emerging risk issues and directs risk mitigation actions.
assessment of risks: northern trust's risk assessment process consists of a series of programs that identify, manage and measure risks. risk assessments are performed on a regular basis by business risk management and facilitated by the risk management function. the risk assessment process draws on the input of management, staff and risk personnel across the business, focusing on the inherent drivers of risk, the effectiveness of controls and the resulting residual risks.
risk management embedding: risk management processes extend beyond risk assessment and measurement, and are embedded in strategic and business planning and decision-making. although the risk management function sets the direction for northern trust's risk management activities, northern trust's businesses are the first line of defense for protecting it against the risks inherent in its businesses and are supported by dedicated business risk management teams.
risk reporting, review and communication: the risk reporting, review and communication process produces risk reports that provide updates on the risk profile, performance against risk guidelines and thresholds, and analysis and trend information, all of which highlight top and emerging risks for management and the board. risk reporting includes a robust escalation process to alert senior management of significant issues.
risk control risk control is an internal, independent review function within the risk management function. risk control is managed by the chief risk control officer and is comprised of the following groups, each with its own risk focus and oversight. the business risk committee oversees risk control and each of the groups below.
model risk management financial and risk modeling are used by northern trust to inform numerous decisions regarding risk management, as well as capital estimation, financial reporting and disclosure, valuation and pricing and portfolio management. model risk may result from decisions based on models that produce incorrect results or models that are improperly used. model risk management is responsible for the implementation and management of the enterprise-wide model risk framework and independently validating new models and reviewing and re-validating existing models. validations are documented and include an assessment of the conceptual soundness of the modeling approach, outcomes analysis, applicability of use, model assumptions and limitations, development documentation, ongoing monitoring and model controls. oversight of model risk management is provided by the mroc.
2015 annual report / northern trust corporation     70
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations credit review credit review provides an independent, ongoing assessment of credit exposure and related credit risk management processes across northern trust. the scope of credit review activities includes all client-related transactions that give rise to credit exposure and processes that are designed to manage or monitor such exposure. credit exposure includes credit risk inherent in the entire portfolio, as well as individual credits or transactions in the form of direct outstandings, potential exposure and contingent liabilities that are on- or off-balance sheet.
global compliance testing and independent verification global compliance testing evaluates the effectiveness of procedures and controls designed to comply with relevant laws and regulations, as well as corresponding northern trust policies governing regulatory compliance activities. global compliance testing identifies weaknesses that could result in regulatory compliance violations or risks to northern trust's businesses and monitors action plans designed to mitigate those weaknesses. oversight of global compliance testing activities is provided by the compliance & ethics oversight committee. also included is an independent verification program that promotes rigor and accuracy in northern trust's ongoing compliance with basel iii requirements and adherence to enhanced prudential standards, including liquidity stress testing. the program independently verifies northern trust's advanced systems in order to comply with the qualification requirements related to the advanced internal ratings based and advanced measurement approaches. in addition, independent verification performs conceptual soundness evaluations of proposed changes to the bank's advanced systems prior to notification to regulatory authorities as required in basel coordination committee bulletin 14-2. the independent verification program assesses the effectiveness of the credit risk, operational risk, and market risk frameworks. the independent verification team presents an annual assessment report of its findings to the business risk committee, which is required to review and approve the effectiveness of northern trust's advanced systems on an annual basis.
audit services audit services is an independent control function that assesses and validates controls within northern trust's enterprise risk management framework. audit services is managed by the general auditor with oversight from the audit committee. audit services tests the overall adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal controls associated with the advanced systems on an ongoing basis and reports the results of these audits directly to the audit committee. audit services includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience, including risk management expertise. the general auditor reports directly to the audit committee and the corporation's chief executive officer.
credit risk credit risk is the risk to interest income or principal from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to perform on an obligation.
credit risk overview credit risk is inherent in many of northern trust's activities. a significant component of credit risk relates to loans, leases, securities, and counterparty-related exposures. northern trust's loan portfolio differs significantly from those of other large u.s. financial institutions as it is generally more conservative in terms of credit risk. in particular, northern trust is generally:
•   not an originator of loan products to be sold into a secondary market or to be bundled into asset securitizations;
•   not an agent bank or syndicator of loans, where risk management is achieved post-close through the sale of participations; and
•   not a participant in leveraged financial transactions, such as project finance, private-equity-originated acquisition financing or hedge fund leveraging.
credit risk framework and governance the credit risk management function is the focal point of the credit risk framework and, while independent of the businesses, it works closely with them to achieve the goal of assuring proactive management of credit risk. to monitor and control credit risk, the credit risk management function maintains a framework that consists of policies, standards, and practices designed to promote a conservative credit culture. this function also monitors adherence to corporate policies, standards, and external regulations.
the credit risk management function provides a system of checks and balances for northern trust's diverse credit-related activities by monitoring these activities and practices and promoting their uniform application throughout northern trust. these activities are designed to diversify credit exposure on an industry and client basis and reduce overall credit risk.
2015 annual report / northern trust corporation     71
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the credit risk framework provides authorities for approval of the extension of credit. individual credit authority for commercial and personal loans is limited to specified amounts and maturities. credit requests exceeding individual authority because of amount, rating, term or other conditions, are referred to the relevant group credit approval committee. credit decisions involving exposure in excess of these limits require the approval of the senior credit committee.
the counterparty risk management committee has sole credit authority for the approval, modification, or renewal of credit exposure to all wholesale market counterparties.
the chief credit officer reports directly to the cro. independent oversight and review of the credit risk framework is provided by risk control.
credit risk measurement an integral component of credit risk measurement is northern trust's internal risk rating system. northern trust's internal risk rating system enables identification, measurement, approval and monitoring of credit risk. northern trust uses the advanced internal rating based approach to calculate regulatory capital using regulatory formulas and exposure level risk information from northern trust's internal rating system. calculations include entity-specific information about the obligor's or counterparty's probability of default and exposure-specific information about loss given default, exposure at default and maturity. northern trust's internal risk rating system is intended to rank its credit risk without any modeled linkage to external credit ratings.
the credit risk management function is responsible for the ongoing oversight of each model that supports the internal risk-rating system. this oversight includes the development, monitoring and maintenance of the models, as well as providing information to the credit risk committee to support model approval and monitoring of ongoing model performance. independent model governance and oversight is further supported by the activities of risk control.
loans and other extensions of credit a significant component of credit risk relates to the loan portfolio, including contractual obligations such as legally binding commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. these contractual obligations and arrangements are discussed in note 27, "off-balance-sheet financial instruments," to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data," and in the "off-balance-sheet arrangements" section of item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
as part of its credit process, northern trust utilizes an internal borrower risk rating system to support identification, approval, and monitoring of credit risk. borrower risk ratings are used in credit underwriting, management reporting, setting of loss allowances, and capital calculations. borrower risk ratings are discussed further in note 6, "loans and leases," to the consolidated financial statements.
the credit risk management function oversees a range of portfolio reviews that focus on significant and/or weaker-rated credits. this approach allows management to take remedial action in an effort to deal with potential problems. in addition, independent from the credit risk management function, credit review undertakes both on-site and off-site file reviews that evaluate effectiveness of management's implementation of the credit risk management's requirements.
northern trust maintains a loan portfolio watch list for adversely classified credit exposures. these credits, which include all nonperforming credits, are expected to exhibit minimally acceptable probabilities of default, elevated risk of default, or are currently in default. loans outstanding to watch list borrowers associated with these risk profiles that are not currently in default but have limited financial flexibility totaled $328.3 million at december 31, 2015. cash flows and capital levels range from acceptable to potentially insufficient to meet current requirements and borrowers typically have minimal cushion in adverse down cycle scenarios. an integral part of the credit risk management function is a formal review of past due and potential problem loans to determine which credits, if any, need to be placed on nonperforming status or charged off.
counterparty credit risk counterparty credit risk for northern trust primarily arises from over-the-counter (otc) currency and interest rate derivatives and from indemnified securities lending transactions, which in turn are derived from a variety of funding, treasury, trading and custody-related activities. credit exposure to counterparties is managed by use of a framework for setting limits by product type and exposure tenor.
to calculate exposure, northern trust treats repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and indemnified securities lending transactions as repo-style transactions. foreign exchange exposures and interest rate derivatives are treated as otc derivatives. the exposure at default measurement methodology for each eligible type of counterparty credit exposure, including the use of netting and collateral as risk mitigants, is determined based on operational requirements, the characteristics of the contract type and the portfolio size and complexity.
2015 annual report / northern trust corporation     72
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations credit risk mitigation northern trust considers cash flow to be the primary source of repayment for client-related credit exposures. however, northern trust employs several different types of credit risk mitigants to manage its overall credit risk in the event cash flow is not sufficient to repay a credit exposure. northern trust has policies in place to ensure that credit risk mitigation is appropriately recognized, recorded and monitored. recognition of credit risk mitigants in capital estimations is dependent upon the form of mitigation. northern trust broadly groups its risk mitigation techniques into the following three primary categories.
physical and financial collateral: northern trust's primary risk mitigation approaches include the requirement of collateral and/or documented guarantees. liquidation of collateral that is securing credit risk exposures is considered in northern trust's estimation of loss given default. residential and commercial real estate exposures are typically secured by properly margined mortgages on the property. in cases where loans to commercial or certain wealth management clients are secured by marketable securities, the daily values of the securities are monitored closely to ensure adherence to collateral coverage policies. the frequency of collateral valuation increases commensurate with the volatility of the collateral's value.
netting: on-balance-sheet netting is employed on a limited basis. netting is primarily related to foreign exchange transactions with major banks and institutional clients subject to eligible master netting agreements. a sub-set of these arrangements are conducted under an isda credit support annex. northern trust has elected to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of netting within its regulatory capital calculation at this time.
guarantees: personal and corporate guarantees are often taken to facilitate potential collection efforts and to protect northern trust's claims relative to other creditors. northern trust may also recognize "implied support," where the commitment provided is less than that of a legally enforceable guarantee, in its assignment of borrower probability of default as permitted under u.s. supervisory guidance. northern trust has elected not to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of guarantors within its regulatory capital calculation at this time.
another important risk management practice is the avoidance of undue concentrations of exposure, such as in any single (or small number of related) obligor/counterparty, loan type, industry, geography, country or risk mitigant. processes are in place to establish limits on certain concentrations and the monitoring of adherence to the limits.
operational risk operational risk is the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, human factors and systems, or from external events.
operational risk overview operational risk is inherent in each of northern trust's businesses and corporate functions and reflects the potential for inadequate information systems, operating problems, product design and delivery difficulties, potential legal actions, or catastrophes to result in losses. operational risk includes:
•   execution, delivery and process management risk;
•   risk resulting from business disruption and system failures;
•   risk of damage to physical assets;
•   risk resulting from clients, products and business practices;
•   employment practice and workplace safety risk;
•   internal fraud risk;
•   external fraud risk;

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operational risk includes compliance, fiduciary and legal risks, which under the corporation's risk structure are governed and managed explicitly.
to monitor and control operational risk, northern trust maintains a framework that consists of risk management policies, programs and practices designed to promote a sound operational environment.
northern trust's operational risk management strategy is to:
•   align the operational risk framework with evolving business and industry practice and with regulatory requirements;
•   identify, assess and mitigate risks inherent in business strategies;
•   promote risk awareness and foster a proactive risk management environment within each business; and
•   report key topics and developments to senior governance bodies.
the goal of these activities is to keep the operational risk profile and losses within the board-approved corporate risk appetite statement and guidelines.
the operational risk management function is responsible for defining the operational risk framework and providing independent oversight of the framework across northern trust. it is the responsibility of each business to implement the corporate-wide operational risk framework as well as business specific risk management programs to identify, monitor, measure, and manage operational risk and mitigate northern trust's exposure to loss. risk control provides independent oversight and review of the operational risk framework.
operational risk framework and governance the orc is responsible for overseeing the activities of northern trust related to the management of operational risk. this committee has the expanded role of coordinating operational risk issues related to compliance and fiduciary risks. the purpose of this committee is to provide executive management's insight and guidance to the management of existing and emerging operational risks.
the orc is responsible for setting the corporate operational risk management policy and approving the operational risk framework and programs that support the coordination of operational risk activities to identify, monitor, measure, manage and report on operational risk. in addition, the orc serves as an escalation point for significant issues raised by its programs.
operational risk is identified, monitored, measured, managed and reported through the operational risk framework. the framework is deployed consistently and globally across all businesses and its objective is to identify and measure the factors that impact risk and drive action to reduce future loss events. several key programs support the operational risk framework, including:
•   loss event data program - a program that collects loss data for use in monitoring operational risk exposure, various business analyses and a basel advanced management approach (ama) capital quantification. both internal and external loss data are used in the operational risk capital quantification. thresholds drive analysis, action and escalation through northern trust's businesses and the operational risk management function.
•   risk and control self-assessment - a structured risk management process used by northern trust's businesses to analyze the risks that are present in their respective business environments, processes and activities and to assess the adequacy of associated internal controls.
•   operational risk scenario analysis - a systematic process of obtaining expert opinions from business managers and risk management experts to derive reasoned assessments of the likelihood of occurrence and the potential loss impact of plausible high-severity operational losses. this process facilitates management's consideration of operational risk to which the business is exposed and the potential impact and response to such events.
•   product and process risk management program - a program used for evaluating and managing risks associated with the introduction of new and modified noncredit products and services, significant changes to operating processes, and proposed business process outsourcing arrangements.
•   outsourcing risk management program - a program that provides processes for appropriate risk assessment, measurement, monitoring and management of outsourced technology and business process outsourcing.
•   business process transition risk management program - a program designed to effectively manage the risk associated with transitioning and migrating business processes to different geographic or jurisdictional locations within the organization.
•   information security and technology risk management - a program that communicates and implements compliance and risk management processes and controls to address information security and technology risks to the organization.
•   significant new business opportunity - a program that assesses the resource requirements, impact on systems and controls, and other risk factors prior to taking on significant new business.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
•   scalability &amp; capacity assessment review - a program that provides a mechanism for identifying scalability and/or capacity constraints within northern trust's business areas and their ability to take on change, whether driven by new business, strategic projects, market volatility or regulatory change.
•   operational concentration risk management - a program that provides an assessment of process concentrations within the corporation.
•   fraud prevention program - a program that provides tools, advice, and guidance to northern trust's businesses to help mitigate fraud risk.
•   business continuity management program - a program designed to minimize business impact and support the resumption of mission critical functions for clients following an incident.
•   physical security - a program that provides for the safety of northern trust partners, clients, and visitors worldwide by setting and enforcing standards, providing training, establishing partnerships, and encouraging continual improvement in workplace security.
•   insurance management program - a program designed to reduce the monetary impact of certain operational loss events.
as discussed in risk control, model risk management also is part of the operational risk framework.
operational risk measurement northern trust utilizes a basel ama capital quantification process to estimate required capital for the corporation and applicable u.s. banking subsidiaries. northern trust's ama capital quantification process incorporates outputs from the loss event data, risk and control self-assessment and operational risk scenario analysis programs to derive required capital. while internal loss data is the foundation for the capital quantification, external loss data is also utilized to inform the creation of scenario analysis data employed in the capital quantification process. business environment and internal control factor information is used to estimate loss frequency and as an adjustment to capital estimates. the ama capital quantification process uses a loss distribution approach methodology to combine frequency and severity distributions to arrive at an estimate of the potential aggregate loss at the 99.9th percentile over a one-year time horizon.
information security northern trust's approach to information security begins at a governance level with an organizational structure which reflects support from executive management and includes risk committees comprised of members from across northern trust's businesses. in addition, technology risk is mitigated not only through a strong governance process, but also internal controls and risk management practices designed to keep risk at levels appropriate to northern trust's overall risk appetite and the inherent risk in the markets in which northern trust operates. the desired control environment is expressed through northern trust's policies, standards and guidelines that together define its tolerance for risk. each business is responsible for complying with these policies, standards and guidelines, as well as external regulations. where appropriate, these policies, standards and guidelines contain limits and benchmarks to facilitate the measurement, monitoring and reporting of risk.
effective management of information and technology risk is crucial in an environment of increasing threat and requires a structured approach to establish and communicate expectations and required practices. northern trust employees are responsible for promoting information security and following sound technology risk management practices as well as adhering to applicable policies and standards and other means provided to them to safeguard electronic information and business systems within their care. training and awareness programs to educate employees on information security are on-going and include multiple approaches such as mandatory computer based training. in cases where northern trust relies on vendors to perform services, controls are routinely reviewed for alignment with industry standards and their ability to protect information. any findings identified are remediated following a risk-based approach.
in addition to the various information security controls managed and monitored within the organization, northern trust uses external third party security teams on a regular basis to assess effectiveness.  these teams perform security program maturity assessments, penetration tests, security assessments and reviews of northern trust's susceptibility to social engineering attacks such as spear phishing. northern trust operates a global security operations center for threat identification and response. this center aggregates security threat information from systems and platforms across the business, and alerts the organization in accordance with its documented cyber incident response plan.
business resiliency northern trust's business resiliency approach encompasses business continuity and disaster recovery processes enterprise-wide (including staff, technology and facilities) to ensure that following a disaster or business interruption northern trust resumes mission-critical business functions and fulfills all regulatory and legal requirements.
2015 annual report / northern trust corporation     75
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations northern trust's business resiliency mitigation and preventative measures include sophisticated physical security, resilient designs and peer capacity for its corporate data centers, a highly redundant global network, robust network security, resiliency centers that offer alternative workstations, and transfer of work and work-from-home programs that provide further capability by allowing staff to work from home.
all of northern trust's businesses are required to regularly risk-assess their critical functions and develop business continuity plans covering resource requirements (people, systems, vendor relationships and other assets), arrangements for obtaining these resources and prioritizing the resumption of each function in compliance with corporate standards. the strength of the business continuity programs of all critical third-party vendors to northern trust are reviewed on a regular basis. all of northern trust's businesses test their plans at least annually.
the orc annually reviews and presents the corporate business continuity plan to the business risk committee.
fiduciary risk fiduciary risks are risks arising from the failure, in administering or managing financial and other assets in clients' fiduciary accounts: i) to adhere to a fiduciary standard of care if required under the terms of governing documents or applicable laws; or ii) to properly discharge fiduciary duties. fiduciary status may hinge on the nature of a particular function being performed and fiduciary standards may vary by jurisdiction, type of relationship and governing document.
fiduciary risk overview the fiduciary risk management program identifies, assesses, measures and monitors fiduciary risk. fiduciary risk is mitigated through internal controls and risk management practices that are designed to identify, understand and keep such risk at levels consistent with the organization's overall risk appetite while also managing the inherent risk in each relationship for which northern trust serves in a fiduciary capacity. each business is responsible for complying with all corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures, standards and guidelines to manage fiduciary risk within the desired risk appetite level.  each business also is expected to establish procedures for enhanced review in the event a product or relationship involves unique or more complex fiduciary risks. the corporate fiduciary risk program framework utilizes existing corporate and business risk management tools to measure and guide the assessment of fiduciary risk in the businesses.
fiduciary risk framework and governance the frc is responsible for establishing and reviewing the fiduciary risk policies and establishing the fiduciary risk framework, governance and programs that support the coordination of fiduciary risk activities to identify, monitor, manage and report on fiduciary risk. at frc meetings, senior management reviews and discusses fiduciary risks including existing and emerging issues. in addition, the frc serves as an escalation point for significant issues raised by its subcommittees or elsewhere in the organization.
compliance risk compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, other regulatory requirements, or codes of conduct and other standards of self-regulatory organizations applicable to northern trust. compliance risk includes the following two subcategories:
•   regulatory risk - risk arising from failure to comply with prudential and conduct of business or other regulatory requirements.
•   financial crime risk - risk arising from financial crime (e.g., money laundering, sanctions violations, fraud, insider dealing, theft, etc.) in relation to the products, services, or accounts of the institution, its clients, or others associated with the same.
compliance risk framework and governance the compliance risk management framework identifies, assesses, controls, measures, monitors and reports on compliance risk. the framework is designed to minimize compliance risk and maintain an environment in which criminal or regulatory violations do not occur. the framework includes a comprehensive governance structure and a compliance and ethics program approved by the business risk committee.
each business is responsible for the implementation and effectiveness of the compliance and ethics program and specific compliance policies within their respective businesses. each business is responsible for its respective employees' compliance with corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures, standards and guidelines to manage compliance risk in accordance with northern trust's compliance and ethics program.
the compliance and ethics oversight committee establishes and monitors adherence to northern trust's compliance and ethics program. the chief compliance and ethics officer reports to the business risk committee as appropriate and chairs the compliance and ethics oversight committee.
2015 annual report / northern trust corporation     76
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market risk there are two types of market risk. interest rate risk is the potential for movements in interest rates to cause changes in earnings and the economic value of equity. trading risk is the potential for movements in market variables such as foreign exchange and interest rates to cause changes in the value of trading positions.
market risk framework and governance northern trust maintains a market risk framework consisting of risk management policies, programs and practices to keep the market risk profile within the board-approved corporate risk appetite statement. all market risk activities are overseen by the corporate market risk function, which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities. independent oversight and review of the market risk framework is provided by risk control.
exposure limits for market risk are set by the board and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies, external regulations and established procedures. alco and its subcommittee, the market and liquidity risk committee (mlrc), provide independent oversight and are responsible for developing the market risk management framework and programs that support the coordination of market risk activities to identify, monitor, manage and report on market risk. at alco and mlrc meetings, senior management reviews and discusses northern trust's market risk profile as well as various scenario analyses. alco and mlrc establish and monitor guidelines based on measures such as soe, seve, var and notional position sizes.
interest rate risk overview interest rate risk is the risk to earnings, associated with the balance sheet, or value of equity due to changes in interest rates. changes in interest rates can have a positive or negative impact on earnings depending on the positioning of assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet instruments. the impact to earnings will primarily come through net interest income, but it can also impact certain types of fees related to the balance sheet. changes in interest rates also can impact the values of assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet positions, which indirectly impact the value of equity. to mitigate interest rate risk, the structure of the balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities (adjusted for hedges) are highly correlated, which allows northern trust's interest-bearing assets and liabilities to contribute to earnings even in periods of volatile interest rates.
there are four commonly recognized types of interest rate risk:
•   repricing, which arises from differences in the maturity and repricing terms of assets and liabilities;
•   yield curve, which arises from changes in the shape of the yield curve;
•   basis, which arises from the changing relationships between rates earned and paid on different financial instruments with otherwise similar repricing characteristics; and
•   embedded optionality, which arises from client or counterparty behavior in response to interest rate changes.
interest rate risk measurement, reporting and analysis northern trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk: soe and seve. simulation of earnings provides management with a short-term view of the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings. simulation of economic value of equity provides management with a long-term view of interest rate changes on the economic value of equity as of the period-end balance sheet. both simulation models use the same initial market interest rates and product balances. these two techniques, which are performed monthly, are complementary and are used in concert to provide a comprehensive interest rate risk management capability.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations sensitivity of earnings (soe)
the modeling of soe incorporates on-balance-sheet positions, as well as derivative financial instruments (principally interest rate swaps) that are used to manage interest rate risk. northern trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity (i.e. change) in earnings if future rates are 100 or 200 basis points higher than base case forward rates. each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a one-year period. the 100 basis point increase, for example, consists of twelve consecutive monthly increases of 8.3 basis points. the model simulations also incorporate the following assumptions:
•   the balance sheet size and mix generally remains constant over the simulation horizon with maturing assets and liabilities replaced with instruments with similar terms as those that are maturing, with the exception of certain products such as securities (the assumed reinvestment of which is determined by management's strategies); non-maturity deposits, of which some recent increases are assumed to be temporary in nature; and long-term fixed rate borrowings that upon maturity are replaced with overnight wholesale instruments;
•   prepayments on mortgage loans and securities collateralized by mortgages are projected under each rate scenario using a third-party mortgage analytics system that incorporates market prepayment assumptions;
•   cash flows for structured securities are estimated using a third-party vendor in conjunction with the prepayments provided by the third-party mortgage analytics vendor;
•   non-maturity deposit rates are projected based on northern trust's actual historical pattern of pricing these products, or based on judgment when there is no appropriate history or when current pricing strategies differ from history;
•   commercial demand deposits are treated as short-term rate sensitive as these balances may receive an explicit interest rate or an earnings credit that can be applied to fees for services provided by northern trust; and
•   new business rates are based on current spreads to market indices.
the following table shows the estimated impact on the next twelve months of pre-tax earnings, excluding fee waivers, of 100 and 200 basis point upward movements in interest rates relative to forward rates. given the low level of interest rates, the simulation of earnings for rates 100 and 200 basis points lower would not provide meaningful results.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations sensitivity of economic value of equity (seve)
economic value of equity is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities, net of the value of instruments that are used to manage the interest rate risk of balance sheet items. the potential effect of interest rate changes on economic equity is derived from the impact of such changes on projected future cash flows and the present value of these cash flows and is then compared to the established limit. northern trust uses current market rates (and the future rates implied by these market rates) as the base case and measures seve if current rates are immediately shocked up by 100 or 200 basis points. the model simulations also incorporate the following assumptions:
•   prepayments on mortgage loans and securities collateralized by mortgages are projected under each rate scenario using a third-party mortgage analytics system that incorporates market prepayment assumptions;
•   cash flows for structured securities are estimated using a third-party vendor in conjunction with the prepayments provided by the third-party mortgage analytics vendor;
•   nonmaturity deposit rates are projected based on northern trust's actual historical pattern of pricing. projected rates may also be based on judgment when there is no appropriate history or when current pricing strategies differ from history. the present value of these deposits are based on estimated remaining lives that are based on northern trust's actual historical runoff patterns with some balances assumed to be temporary;
•   the present values of most noninterest-related balances (such as receivables, equipment, and payables) are the same as their book values; and
•   the initial shock to current rates assumes the relationship among market yield curves (e.g. treasury and libor) remains the same in each interest rate scenario.
the following table shows the estimated impact on economic value of equity of 100 and 200 basis point shocks up from current interest rates. given the low level of interest rates and assumed interest rate floors as rates approach zero, the simulation of the economic value of equity for rates 100 or 200 basis points lower would not provide meaningful results.

during the year ended december 31, 2015, northern trust did not exceed its seve limits.
interest rate risk monitoring northern trust limits aggregate interest rate risk (as measured by the soe and seve simulation techniques) to an acceptable level within the context of risk/return trade-offs. a variety of actions may be used to implement risk management strategies to modify interest rate risk including:
•   purchase of securities;
•   sale of securities that are classified as available for sale;
•   issuance of senior notes and subordinated notes;
•   collateralized borrowings from the federal home loan bank;
•   placing and taking eurodollar time deposits; and
•   hedges with various types of derivative financial instruments.
northern trust strives to use the most effective instruments for implementing its interest rate risk management strategies, considering the costs, liquidity, collateral and capital requirements of the various alternatives and the risk-return trade-offs.
2015 annual report / northern trust corporation     79
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations foreign currency risk overview northern trust's balance sheet is exposed to non-trading foreign currency risk as a result of its holdings of non-u.s. dollar denominated assets and liabilities, investment in non-u.s. subsidiaries, and future non-u.s. dollar denominated revenue and expense. to manage currency exposures on the balance sheet, northern trust attempts to match its assets and liabilities by currency. if those currency offsets do not exist on the balance sheet, northern trust will use foreign exchange derivative contracts to mitigate its currency exposure. foreign exchange contracts are also used to reduce northern trust's currency exposure to future non-u.s. dollar denominated revenue and expense.
in addition, northern trust provides foreign exchange services to clients. most of these services are provided in connection with northern trust's growing global custody business. in the normal course of business northern trust also engages in trading of non-u.s. currencies for its own account. both activities are considered trading activities. the primary market risk associated with global foreign exchange trading activities is foreign exchange risk.
foreign currency trading positions exist when aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the u.s. dollar do not offset each other in amount, or offset each other over different time periods.
foreign currency risk measurement northern trust measures daily the risk of loss associated with all non-u.s. currency positions using a var model and applying the historical simulation methodology. this statistical model provides estimates, based on a variety of high confidence levels, of the potential loss in value that might be incurred if an adverse shift in non-u.s. currency exchange rates were to occur over a small number of days. the model incorporates foreign currency and interest rate volatilities and correlations in price movements among the currencies. var is computed for each trading desk and for the global portfolio.
var measures are computed in a vended software application which reads foreign exchange positions from northern trust's trading systems each day. data vendors provide foreign exchange rates and interest rates for all currencies. the corporate market risk function monitors on a daily basis var model inputs and outputs for reasonableness.
foreign currency risk monitoring, reporting and analysis northern trust monitors several variations of the foreign exchange var measures to meet specific regulatory and internal management needs. variations include different methodologies (historical, variance-covariance and monte carlo), equally-weighted and exponentially-weighted volatilities, horizons of one day and ten days, confidence levels ranging from 95% to 99.95% and look back periods of one year and four years. those alternative measures provide management a rich array of corroborating metrics and alternative perspectives on northern trust's market risks.
automated daily reports are produced and distributed to business managers and risk managers. the corporate market risk function also reviews and reports several variations of the var measures in historical time series format to provide management with a historical perspective on risk.
the table below presents the levels of total regulatory var and its subcomponents for global foreign currency in the years indicated below, based on the historical simulation methodology, a 99% confidence level, a one day horizon and equally weighted volatility. the total var for foreign currency is typically less than the sum of its two components due to diversification benefits derived from the two subcomponents.

during 2015 and 2014, northern trust did not incur an actual trading loss in excess of the daily value at risk estimate.
other nonmaterial trading activities market risk associated with other trading activities is negligible. northern trust's broker-dealer, northern trust securities, inc., maintains a small portfolio of trading securities held for customer accommodation purposes which averaged $4.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2015.
northern trust is also party to interest rate derivative contracts consisting mostly of interest rate swaps entered into to meet clients' interest rate management needs, but also including a small number of caps, floors, and swaptions (an option to enter into an interest rate swap). all interest rate derivative transactions are executed by the treasury department. when
2015 annual report / northern trust corporation     80
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations northern trust enters into client transactions, its practice is to mitigate the resulting market risk with offsetting interbank derivative transactions with matching terms and maturities.
strategic risk strategic risk is the long-term risk to earnings or capital from adverse effects of business decisions, improper implementation of business decisions, unexpected external events or damage to northern trust's reputation from negative public opinion. strategic risk includes the following three subcategories:
business risk: the risk arising from the general economic conditions and external factors in which northern trust operates that could adversely affect its revenues, profits and or capital;
strategy risk: the long-term risk to earnings or capital from adverse effects of business decisions, improper implementation of business decisions and unexpected external events; and reputation risk: the risk arising from negative perception on the part of clients, counterparties, stockholders, investors, debt holders, market analysts, regulators, staff, or other relevant parties that adversely affects northern trust's ability to conduct its business or to access sources of funding.
gerc and the business risk committee are responsible for reviewing the general methods, guidelines and policies by which northern trust monitors and controls strategic risk.
forward-looking statements this report may include statements which constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. forward-looking statements are identified typically by words or phrases such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "project," "likely," "plan," "goal," "target," "strategy," and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as "may," "will," "should," "would," and "could." forward-looking statements include statements, other than those related to historical facts, that relate to northern trust's financial results and outlook, capital adequacy, dividend policy, accounting estimates and assumptions, credit quality including allowance levels, future pension plan contributions, anticipated tax benefits, anticipated expense levels, spending related to technology and regulatory initiatives, risk management policies, contingent liabilities, strategic initiatives, industry trends, and expectations regarding the impact of recent legislation and accounting pronouncements. these statements are based on northern trust's current beliefs and expectations of future events or future results, and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and subject to change. these statements are also based on assumptions about many important factors, including:
•   financial market disruptions or economic recession, whether in the united states, europe, the middle east, asia or other regions;
•   volatility or changes in financial markets, including debt and equity markets, that impact the value, liquidity, or credit ratings of financial assets in general, or financial assets held in particular investment funds or client portfolios, including those funds, portfolios, and other financial assets with respect to which northern trust has taken, or may in the future take, actions to provide asset value stability or additional liquidity;
•   the impact of equity markets on fee revenue;
•   the downgrade of u.s. government-issued and other securities;
•   changes in foreign exchange trading client volumes and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in the valuation of the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies in which northern trust records revenue or accrues expenses, and northern trust's success in assessing and mitigating the risks arising from all such changes and volatility;
•   a decline in the value of securities held in northern trust's investment portfolio, particularly asset-backed securities, the liquidity and pricing of which may be negatively impacted by periods of economic turmoil and financial market disruptions;
•   northern trust's ability to address operating risks, including cyber-security or data security breach risks, human errors or omissions, pricing or valuation of securities, fraud, systems performance or defects, systems interruptions, and breakdowns in processes or internal controls;
•   northern trust's success in responding to and investing in changes and advancements in technology;
•   a significant downgrade of any of northern trust's debt ratings;

(1)   represents the percentage of rsf leased or under negotiation as of december 31, 2015.
(2)   represents a secured note payable with a contractual rate of 3.93% and a maturity date in 2023.
(3)   during the three months ended march 31, 2015, we executed an agreement to purchase the outstanding 10% noncontrolling interest in our 1.2 million rsf campus at alexandria technology square® for $108.3 million. upon execution of the purchase agreement, we recognized a liability representing the fair value of the aggregate consideration, primarily consisting of the $108.3 million purchase price. the first installment of $54.3 million was paid on april 1, 2015, and the second installment of $54.0 million is due on april 1, 2016.
(4)   we believe there is further upside in our projected returns as we anticipate significant rent growth from 81% of the leases contractually ending in the five years following the date of acquisition. additionally, we believe we can increase our 1.2 million rsf campus by an additional 100,000 rsf and further increase noi. the campus is currently 99.9% occupied and subject to a long-term ground lease. after considering the $108.3 million purchase of the outstanding 10% noncontrolling interest in this flagship campus and the anticipated near- and medium-term upside in noi from rental rate growth and campus expansion, we estimate that we can enhance our unlevered yields on our aggregate investment in the campus over the next five years to 8.5% and 8.1% (cash basis).
(5)   subsequent to the acquisition, in the third quarter of 2015, we leased 150,000 rsf, or 100%, of phase one of the project to pinterest, inc.
(6)   we acquired this site for development, and the land parcel is subject to a long-term ground lease. the land parcel is located adjacent to one of our existing campuses in the lake union submarket.
(7)   concurrent with the acquisition, we leased the entire 304,326 rsf, representing 100% of 10290 campus point drive, to eli lilly and company.
(8)   we acquired this project for redevelopment, and the property is subject to a long-term ground lease.

real estate asset sales our asset sale strategy consists of (i) the recycling of capital from high-value assets (via the sale of partial interests to high-quality institutional investors or the sale of 100%), (ii) the sale of non-core/"core-like" operating assets, which increases the quality of our asset base, and (iii) the sale of non-strategic land parcels, all of which provide a significant source of capital to fund our highly pre-leased value-creation development and redevelopment projects. our real estate asset sales during the year ended december 31, 2015, consisted of the following (dollars in thousands, except per rsf amounts):

execution of capital strategy during 2015, we continued to execute on many of the long-term components of our capital strategy. some of our key accomplishments include:
2015 capital strategy
•   achieved targeted key credit metric ratios, including a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of 6.6x and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 3.6x for the fourth quarter of 2015 on an annualized basis;
•   continued the process of prudently laddering our debt maturities as we completed the successful offering in november 2015 of $300.0 million of unsecured senior notes payable with a stated interest rate of 4.30% due in 2026 and extended the average remaining term of outstanding debt to 5.6 years as of december 31, 2015;
•   $2.0 billion of liquidity as of december 31, 2015;
•   executed additional interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $1.7 billion during the year ended december 31, 2015 to provide a minimum of hedged variable-rate debt of $1.1 billion and $650.0 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively;
•   in october 2015, we closed a secured construction loan with commitments available for borrowing aggregating $350.0 million, which bears interest at a rate of libor+1.50%, for our 98% leased development project at 50/60 binney street in our cambridge submarket;
•   in june 2015, we exercised the first of two one-year extensions on a $47.6 million secured construction loan, which extended the maturity date from july 1, 2015, to july 1, 2016;
66
•   in june 2015, we completed a partial principal repayment of $25.0 million, extended the maturity date of the remaining $350 million unsecured senior bank term loan from 2016 to 2021, and reduced pricing to libor+1.10% from libor+1.20%; and
•   maintained a high-quality tenant base as of december 31, 2015, with 54% of our total abr rent from investment-grade tenants.
during 2016, we intend to continue to execute our capital strategy to achieve further improvements to our credit rating, which will allow us to further reduce our cost of capital and continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation that generates strong yields. for further information, refer to the "projected results" section below within this item 7.
balance sheet management as described above, we successfully executed our long-term capital strategy in 2015, continuing to strengthen our balance sheet and credit profile. consistent with 2015, our capital strategy for 2016 consists of the following elements:
•   allocate capital to class a assets located in unique collaborative science and technology campuses in aaa urban innovation clusters;
•   continue to improve our credit profile;
•   maintain access to diverse sources of capital, which includes cash flows from operating activities after dividends, incremental debt supported by our growth in ebitda, assets sales, joint venture capital, and other capital such as the sale of equity;
•   commitment to long-term capital to fund growth;
•   prudently ladder of debt maturities;
•   maintain significant balance sheet liquidity; and
•   maintain a stable and flexible balance sheet.
given the anticipated delivery of significant incremental ebitda from our development and redevelopment projects, we expect to have capacity to obtain debt funding for a significant portion of our capital requirements to fund the construction of high-value, class a, highly pre-leased development and redevelopment projects on a leverage-neutral basis. we expect to continue to maintain access to a diverse source of debt, including unsecured senior notes payable, as well as secured construction loans for our development and redevelopment projects from time to time. we expect to continue to maintain a significant proportion of our noi unencumbered to allow for future flexibility for accessing both unsecured and secured debt markets, although we expect traditional secured mortgage notes payable will remain a small component of our capital structure.
in addition to debt funding on a leverage-neutral basis, we intend to supplement our remaining capital needs with cash flows from operating activities, after dividends and proceeds from asset sales, real estate joint ventures, and other equity capital. we pursued a strategy of assets sales in 2015 that combined the sales of partial real estate joint venture interests in low cap rate operating assets to high-quality institutional investors and the sales of certain land parcels and non-core operating assets, which allowed us to increase the quality of our asset base and to monetize a portion of the significant incremental nav we created in the class a properties we sold. we expect to identify additional real estate assets for sale in 2016 using a similar strategy over the next several quarters to generate additional proceeds for reinvestment into our value-creation projects, subject to market conditions. the amount of asset sales necessary to meet our sources of capital forecast will vary depending upon the amount of ebitda associated with the assets sold. for example, the sale of an income-producing property benefits leverage less than the sale of a non-income-producing land parcel.
as of december 31, 2015, approximately 3% of our gross real estate represented future value-creation projects not undergoing construction. development and redevelopment projects that we expect to place into service by the end of 2016 represented 7% of our gross investments in real estate. additional development and redevelopment projects that we expect to place into service during 2017-2018 represented 5% of our gross investments in real estate.
67
improved cost of capital as part of our capital strategy to continue strengthening our credit profile, we expect to complete and place into service development and redevelopment projects under construction, which we expect will deliver significant incremental ebitda. as our ebitda grows in 2016 and beyond, this growth in ebitda should allow us to obtain debt funding on a leverage-neutral basis and provide significant capital to our development and redevelopment projects. the resulting improvement in our balance sheet leverage ratio should allow us to access diverse sources of capital, strengthen our credit profile, and reduce our borrowing costs. in addition, we expect to continue to maintain a significant proportion of unencumbered noi. for the year ended december 31, 2015, our unencumbered noi as a percentage of total noi was 80%.
non-real estate investments we hold investments in publicly traded companies and privately held entities involved primarily in the science and technology industries. some of our investee are also tenants.
as of december 31, 2015, our investments aggregated $353.5 million, or approximately 4.0% of our total assets, including $117.6 million of unrealized gains from investments in publicly traded entities. the chart and table below show selected investment statistics as of december 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):

results of operations noi is a non-gaap financial measure equal to income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable gaap financial measure, excluding loss on early extinguishment of debt, impairment of real estate, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and general and administrative expense. we believe noi provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects primarily those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. therefore, we believe noi is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets, including our pro rata share from our consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. noi on a cash basis is noi, adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent adjustments required by gaap. we believe that noi on a cash basis is helpful to investors as an additional measure of operating performance because it eliminates straight-line rent adjustments to rental revenue.
the chart below shows our noi for the years ended december 31, 2013, through december 31, 2015:
further, we believe noi is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, noi reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, which provides a perspective not immediately apparent from income from continuing operations. noi excludes certain components from income from continuing operations in order to provide results that are more closely related to the results of operations of our properties. for example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level rather than at the property level. in addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. impairments of real estate have been excluded in deriving noi because we do not consider impairments of real estate to be property-level operating expenses. impairments of real estate relate to changes in the values of our assets and do not reflect the current operating performance with respect to related revenues or expenses. our impairment of real estate represents the write-down in the value of the assets to the estimated fair value less cost to sell. these impairments result from investing decisions and the deterioration in market conditions that adversely impact underlying real estate values. our calculation of noi also excludes charges incurred from changes in certain financing decisions, such as losses on early extinguishment of debt, as these charges often relate to the timing of corporate strategy. property operating expenses that are included in determining noi consist of costs that are related to our operating properties, such as utilities; repairs and maintenance; rental expense related to ground leases; contracted services, such as janitorial, engineering, and landscaping; property taxes and insurance; and property-level salaries. general and administrative expenses consist primarily of accounting and corporate compensation, corporate insurance, professional fees, office rent, and office supplies that are incurred as part of corporate office management, and are excluded from noi because they represent the ownership structure we have and are not necessarily linked to the operating performance of our properties. noi presented by us may not be comparable to noi reported by other equity reits that define noi differently. we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, noi should be examined in conjunction with income from continuing operations as presented in our consolidated statements of income. noi should not be considered as an alternative to income from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or our ability to make distributions.

same properties as a result of changes within our total property portfolio during the comparative periods presented, including changes from assets acquired or sold, properties placed into development or redevelopment, and development and/or redevelopment properties recently placed into service, the consolidated total rental revenues, tenant recoveries, and rental operating expenses in our operating results can show significant changes from period to period. in order to supplement an evaluation of our results of operations over a given period, we analyze the operating performance for all properties, including only our pro rata share of amounts from consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, for comparable properties, referred to as same properties, that were fully operating for the entirety of the comparative periods presented. these properties are analyzed separately from properties acquired subsequent to the first day in the earliest comparable period presented, properties that underwent development or redevelopment at any time during the comparative periods and corporate entities (legal entities performing general and administrative functions), which are excluded from same property results. additionally, rental revenues from lease termination fees, if any, are excluded from the results of the same properties.

rental revenues total rental revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015, increased by $64.7 million, or 11.9%, to $608.8 million, compared to $544.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was primarily due to rental revenues from our non-same properties, which consisted of the following: (i) increase of $50.5 million due to the placement into service subsequent to january 1, 2014, of highly leased development and redevelopment projects, respectively, aggregating 1.3 million rsf, and (ii) increase of $13.6 million due to acquisitions subsequent to january 1, 2014, of operating properties aggregating 384,626 rsf.
rental revenues from our same properties for the year ended december 31, 2015, increased by $596 thousand, or 0.1%, to $482.1 million, compared to $481.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was primarily due to the rental rate increases on renewed/re-leased space, which was offset by free rent provided to our tenant at 3115 merryfield row as part of a relocation in 2015.
tenant recoveries tenant recoveries for the year ended december 31, 2015, increased by $35.6 million, or 20.5%, to $209.1 million, compared to $173.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase is relatively consistent with the increase in our rental operating expenses of $42.1 million, or 19.2% as discussed under "rental operating expenses" below. same properties tenant recoveries increased by $15.3 million, or 9.6%, primarily as a result of an increase in same properties rental operating expenses of $10.3 million, or 5.3%, as discussed below, and an increase from one of our top 20 tenants converting from a gross lease to a triple net lease in 2015.
other income other income for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, consisted of the following (in thousands):

rental operating expenses total rental operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015, increased by $42.1 million, or 19.2%, to $261.2 million, compared to $219.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. approximately $31.7 million of the increase was due to an increase in rental operating expenses from our non-same properties, primarily related to development and redevelopment projects placed into service subsequent to january 1, 2014, and operating properties acquired subsequent to january 1, 2014, as mentioned above.
same properties' rental operating expenses increased by $10.3 million, or 5.3%, during the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily due to higher (i) utility expense, (ii) snow removal expense, and (iii) property taxes. utilities expense increased primarily due to higher utility rates for properties in the san francisco, san diego, and greater boston markets. snow removal expense increased due to a more severe winter in 2015 compared to 2014, and property taxes increased as a result of the higher assessed values in 2015 compared to 2014.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015, increased by $6.1 million, or 11.4%, to $59.6 million, compared to $53.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to continued growth in both the depth and breadth of our operations in multiple markets. as a percentage of total assets, our general and administrative expenses were consistent at 0.7% and 0.7% for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

(1)   represents total interest expense divided by the average debt balance outstanding in the respective periods.
total interest expense increased by $26.5 million, or 33.4%, during the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily as a result of a $15.9 million increase in interest incurred and a $10.6 million decrease in the amount of interest capitalized as a result of our highly leased development and redevelopment projects placed into service subsequent to january 1, 2014, as noted above.
the increase of $15.9 million in total interest incurred was primarily due to a $703.6 million increase in the average debt balance outstanding in 2015 over 2014, including an offering of $700 million of unsecured senior notes payable at a weighted average interest rate of 3.50% in july 2014 and $300 million of unsecured senior notes payable at a stated interest rate of 4.30% in november 2015 which resulted in a $15.1 million increase in interest expense in 2015 related to our unsecured senior notes payable. the proceeds from these notes payable were used primarily to partially fund the construction of our development and redevelopment projects, real estate acquisitions, and to reduce amounts outstanding under our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior term loans. interest from our unsecured senior bank term loans and interest rate swaps decreased by an aggregate $5.1 million, as we continued to transition from variable-rate bank debt to long-term unsecured fixed-rate debt.
the increase in interest expense was partially offset by the decrease in interest expense related to the expiration in march 2014 of certain interest rate swap agreements aggregating $200 million with rates ranging from 4.99% to 5.02%, and expiration in december 2014 of interest rate swap agreements aggregating $500 million with a pay rate of 0.98%.
this decrease was partially offset when we entered into interest rate swap agreements aggregating approximately $950 million with rates ranging from 0.40% to 0.53% with effective dates beginning between december 31, 2014 and march 31, 2015, which allowed us to decrease the weighted average interest rate under our swap agreements. the decrease in weighted average interest rate and the average balance of the notional swap amounts in 2015 compared to that in 2014 allowed us to partially offset the increase in total interest expense.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31, 2015, increased by $37.2 million, or 16.6%, to $261.3 million, compared to $224.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. depreciation increased primarily due to additional depreciation from development and redevelopment projects placed into service subsequent to january 1, 2014, and operating properties aggregating 384,626 rsf that were acquired subsequent to january 1, 2014.

impairment of real estate in december 2015, we determined that a 71,000 rsf, r&d/warehouse property, located at 16020 industrial drive in maryland, met the criteria for classification as "held for sale." accordingly, in december 2015 we recognized an $8.7 million impairment charge to lower the carrying costs of the property to its estimated fair value less cost to sell. we expect to complete the sale of the property in 2016 for approximately $6.4 million.
during the three months ended march 31, 2015, we determined that a 175,000 rsf property in hyderabad, india, met the criteria for classification as "held for sale" and consequently recognized an impairment charge of $14.5 million to lower the carrying costs of the property to its estimated fair value less cost to sell, including an estimated $4.2 million foreign currency exchange translation loss. on march 26, 2015, we completed the sale of the vacant property for $12.4 million and no gain or loss was recognized.
for additional information related to the impairments above, refer to the "sales of real estate assets" section in note 3 - "investments in real estate" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k.
loss on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of a portion of unamortized loan fees aggregating $189 thousand upon our $25.0 million partial repayment of outstanding balances under our unsecured senior bank term loan. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of a portion of unamortized loan fees totaling $525 thousand upon our $125.0 million partial repayment of unsecured senior bank term loan principal outstanding.
equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures of $1.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily includes our 27.5% share of the operating results of our property at 360 longwood avenue in our longwood medical area submarket of greater boston that was placed into service at various dates beginning in the three months ended december 31, 2014. as of december 31, 2015, we had 259,859 rsf, or 63% of this property, in service and occupied, and 153,940 rsf, or 37% of this project, under development.
gain on sales of real estate - rental properties during the year ended december 31, 2015, we sold a property located at 75/125 shoreway road in our palo alto/stanford research park submarket of san francisco aggregating 82,874 rsf for an aggregate sales price of $38.5 million and recognized an aggregate gain on sales of real estate of $12.4 million.
in december 2015, we sold partial interests in four class a assets to a high-quality institutional investor. the aggregate proceeds from the sale of $453.1 million exceeded the value of the underlying properties in comparison to their historical cost basis. these properties remain consolidated in our financial statements, thus no gain has been recognized on our disposition of these partial interests. these sales were accounted for as equity transactions with an adjustment to our additional-paid in capital and noncontrolling interest balances. refer to note 3 - "investments in real estate" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our consolidated real estate joint ventures.

rental revenues total rental revenues for the year ended december 31, 2014, increased by $76.4 million, or 16.3%, to $544.2 million, compared to $467.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily due to rental revenues from our non-same properties, including development and redevelopment projects aggregating 1,521,836 rsf that were delivered after january 1, 2013, and 546,899 rsf operating properties that were acquired subsequent to january 1, 2013. in addition, rental revenues from our same properties increased by $16.4 million, or 3.9%, to $438.0 million from $421.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. occupancy of same properties increased 310 bps, to 96.6% as of december 31, 2014, from 93.5% as of december 31, 2013.
tenant recoveries tenant recoveries for the year ended december 31, 2014, increased by $23.4 million, or 15.6%, to $173.5 million, compared to $150.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase is consistent with the increase in our rental operating expenses of $30.1 million, or 15.9% as discussed under "rental operating expenses" below.
same properties tenant recoveries increased by $10.0 million, or 7.2%, primarily as a result of an increase in same properties rental operating expenses of $9.2 million, or 5.3%, as discussed below.

rental operating expenses total rental operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014, increased by $30.1 million, or 15.9%, to $219.2 million, compared to $189.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. approximately $20.9 million of the increase was due to an increase in rental operating expenses from our non-same properties, primarily related to development and redevelopment projects, and recently acquired operating properties as mentioned above. the same properties increase in rental operating expenses of $9.2 million was primarily due to higher utilities and repairs and maintenance in the year ended december 31, 2014. our utility consumption and repairs and maintenance increased primarily due to a 310 bps increase in occupancy of our same properties in 2014.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014, increased by $5.0 million, or 10.3%, to $53.5 million, compared to $48.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to property acquisition-related expenses from our recent acquisitions, property disposition-related expenses due to sales of real estate, and expenses related to growth in both the depth and breadth of our operations in multiple markets. as a percentage of total assets, our general and administrative expenses were relatively consistent at 0.7% and 0.6% for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

total interest expense increased by $11.3 million during the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily as a result of the $13.5 million reduction in the amount of capitalization of interest related to the delivery of development and redevelopment projects previously mentioned.
the total interest incurred decreased by $2.2 million due to a decrease in our weighted average interest rate from 3.76% as of december 31, 2013, to 3.23% as of december 31, 2014, offset by an approximate $617.5 million increase in outstanding debt. interest from our secured notes payable, unsecured senior line of credit, unsecured senior bank term loans, and interest rate swaps decreased by $23.1 million, and interest from unsecured senior notes payable increased by $19.7 million as we continued to transition from variable-rate bank debt to long-term unsecured fixed-rate debt. during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we completed two offerings of unsecured senior notes payable aggregating $1.20 billion at an average rate of 3.68% and an average maturity of 9.8 years. net proceeds from these offerings were used to partially repay borrowings outstanding under our unsecured senior bank term loan and reduce borrowings outstanding under our unsecured senior line of credit.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31, 2014, increased by $35.0 million, or 18.5%, to $224.1 million, compared to $189.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. depreciation increased primarily due to depreciation related to delivered development and redevelopment projects, and acquired operating properties, as mentioned above.
impairment of real estate during the year ended december 31, 2014, we determined that nine land parcels and three operating properties met the criteria to be classified as "held for sale" and consequently recognized aggregate real estate impairment charges of $51.7 million to lower the carrying costs of this real estate to their estimated fair value less cost to sell. for additional information related to the impairments above, refer to the "sales of real estate assets" section in note 3 - "investments in real estate" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k.
loss on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of a portion of unamortized loan fees aggregating $525 thousand upon our $125.0 million partial repayment of unsecured bank term loan principal outstanding. during the year ended december 31, 2013, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of a portion of unamortized loan fees aggregating $2.0 million upon our $250 million partial repayment of the outstanding principal balance of our senior bank term loan due in 2016.
78
income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations of $1.2 million and $900 thousand for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, includes the results of operations of one property that was classified as "held for sale" as of december 31, 2014, as well as the results of operations (prior to disposition) and gain/loss on sales of real estate attributable to 10 properties sold between january 1, 2013, and december 31, 2014.
gain on sales of real estate - land parcels during the year ended december 31, 2014, excluding the sale of nine land parcels for which we recognized an impairment charge as discussed above, we completed the sale of six parcels of land in various markets aggregating 662,950 rsf for an aggregate sales price of $48.4 million and recognized an aggregate gain on sales of real estate - land parcels of $6.4 million. these gains are classified in gain on sales of real estate - land parcels below income from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. the land parcels sold did not meet the criteria for classification as discontinued operations since the parcels did not have any significant operations prior to disposition.
pursuant to the presentation and disclosure literature on gains/losses on sales or disposals by reits required by the sec, gains or losses on sales or disposals by a reit that do not qualify as discontinued operations are classified below income from discontinued operations in the income statement. accordingly, we classified the gain on sale of land parcel below income from discontinued operations, in the consolidated statements of income, and included the gain in income from continuing operations attributable to alexandria's common stockholders in the "control number," or numerator for the computation of eps.

real estate joint ventures real estate joint ventures represent an important component of our diverse sources of capital. as discussed below, during 2015 we completed the partial sales of class a properties in three separate transactions to a high-quality institutional investor for the aggregate sales price of approximately $453.1 million. as of december 31, 2015, we had several consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. refer to note 3 - "investments in real estate" and note 4 - "investment in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures" to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion of our existing real estate joint ventures.
consolidated real estate joint ventures in december 2015, as described above, we sold partial interests in the following class a properties in three separate transactions to a high-quality institutional investor: (i) 70% interest in 225 binney street in our cambridge submarket, (ii) 40% interest in 409/499 illinois street in our mission bay/soma submarket, and (iii) 49.9% interest in 1500 owens street in our mission bay/soma submarket. refer to note 3 - "investments in real estate" to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our accounting for these partial sales.

as of december 31, 2015, we had cip related to our 11 development projects and four redevelopment projects. the completion of these projects, along with recently delivered projects, certain future projects, and contributions from same properties, is expected to contribute significant increases in rental income, noi, and cash flows. operating performance assumptions related to the completion of our development and redevelopment projects, including the timing of initial occupancy, stabilization dates, and initial stabilized yield, are included in the "investments in real estate" section under item 2. properties of this report. certain key assumptions regarding our projections, including the impact of various development and redevelopment projects, are included in the tables above and in the "projected construction spending" table in the "investments in real estate" section under item 2 of this report.
the completion of our development and redevelopment projects will result in an increase in interest expense and other project costs, because these project costs will no longer qualify for capitalization and will be expensed as incurred. our projection assumptions for same properties noi growth, rental rate growth, straight-line rent, general and administrative expenses, capitalization of interest, and interest expense are included in the tables above and are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties, including those discussed in item 1a and elsewhere in this item 7 of this report. to the extent our full-year earnings guidance is updated during the year, we will provide additional disclosure supporting reasons for any significant changes to such guidance.

liquidity and capital resources overview we expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements, such as requirements for development, redevelopment, other construction projects, capital improvements, tenant improvements, property acquisitions, leasing costs, non-revenue-generating expenditures, and scheduled debt maturities, through net cash provided by operating activities, periodic asset sales, strategic joint venture capital, and long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness, including borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, unsecured senior bank term loans, and the issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities.
we expect to continue meeting our short-term liquidity and capital requirements, as further detailed in this section, generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities. we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make the distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a reit.
over the next several years, our balance sheet, capital structure, and liquidity objectives are as follows:
•   retain positive cash flows from operating activities after payment of dividends for reinvestment in development and redevelopment projects and/or acquisitions;
•   maintain significant liquidity from net cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, and available borrowing capacity under our unsecured senior line of credit and available commitments under our secured construction loans;
•   reduce the amount of our unsecured bank debt;
•   maintain diverse sources of capital, including sources from net cash provided by operating activities, unsecured debt, secured debt, selective asset sales, joint venture capital, preferred stock, and common stock;
•   mitigate unhedged variable-rate debt exposure through the reduction of short-term and medium-term variable-rate bank debt;
•   maintain a large unencumbered asset pool to provide financial flexibility;
•   fund preferred stock and common stock dividends from net cash provided by operating activities;
•   manage a disciplined level of value-creation projects as a percentage of our gross investments in real estate;
•   maintain high levels of pre-leasing and percentage leased in value-creation projects; and
•   decrease the ratio of net debt to adjusted ebitda with some variation from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.

the maturity date of the unsecured senior line of credit is january 2019, assuming we exercise our sole right to extend the stated maturity date, twice, by an additional six months after each exercise. borrowings under the unsecured senior line of credit bear interest at libor or the base rate specified in the amended unsecured senior line of credit agreement, plus, in either case, a specified margin ("applicable margin"). the applicable margin for libor borrowings under the unsecured senior line of credit is based on our existing credit rating as set by certain rating agencies. our unsecured senior line of credit contains a feature that allows lenders to competitively bid on the interest rate for borrowings under the facility. this may result in an interest rate that is below the applicable margin of libor+1.10%. in addition to the applicable margin, our unsecured senior line of credit is subject to an annual facility fee of 0.20% based on the aggregate commitments.

sources and uses of capital we expect that our principal liquidity needs for the year ending december 31, 2016, will be satisfied by the following multiple sources of capital, as shown in the table below. there can be no assurance that our sources and uses of capital will not be materially higher or lower than these expectations.
key sources and uses for 2016 have been updated to reflect a $100 million decrease in construction spending primarily due to the timing of construction spending related to projects expected to be placed into service in 2017 and 2018, as well as updates in the scope of several projects. the mid-point of construction of $850 million is projected to be funded by $375 million of internally generated sources (net cash provided by operating activities after dividends and debt from growth in ebitda), $350 million of asset sales, and $125 million of other capital, including sales of "available-for-sale" equity securities.

92
sources of capital net cash provided by operating activities after dividends we expect to retain $115.0 million to $135.0 million of net cash flows from operating activities after payment of common stock and preferred stock dividends. for the year ending december 31, 2016, we expect the completion of our highly pre-leased value creation projects, along with recently delivered projects, certain future projects, and contributions from same properties, to contribute significant increases in rental income, noi, and cash flows. refer to the "cash flows" section appearing elsewhere under this item 7 of this report for a discussion of net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2015.
93
real estate sales we expect to continue the disciplined execution of select sales of non-strategic land and non-core/"core-like" operating assets. we may also consider additional sales of partial interests in core class a assets and/or development projects. for 2016, we expect to sell real estate ranging from $300 million to $400 million. the amount of asset sales necessary to meet our forecasted sources of capital will vary depending upon the amount of ebitda associated with the assets sold.
for additional information, refer to "sales of real estate assets" in note 3 - "investments in real estate" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. the sale of non-strategic land and non-core/"core-like" operating assets provides a significant source of capital to fund our highly pre-leased value-creation development and redevelopment projects described above.
debt we expect to fund a significant portion of our capital needs in 2016 from the issuance of unsecured senior notes payable, borrowings available under existing secured construction loans, unsecured senior line of credit, and new secured construction loans.
in november 2015, we completed a $300 million public offering of our unsecured senior notes payable at a stated interest rate of 4.30%. the 4.30% unsecured senior notes were priced at 99.624% of the principal amount with a yield to maturity of 4.345% and are due january 15, 2026. we used the proceeds, net of discounts and issuance costs, of $296.4 million to reduce outstanding borrowings on our $1.5 billion unsecured senior line of credit.
in july 2014, we completed public offerings of $400 million in aggregate principal amount and $300 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes payable at stated interest rates of 2.75% and 4.50%, respectively, at a weighted average interest rate of 3.50% and a weighted average maturity of 9.6 years. the 2.75% unsecured senior notes were priced at 99.793% of the principal amount with a yield to maturity of 2.791% and are due january 15, 2020. the 4.50% unsecured senior notes were priced at 99.912% of the principal amount with a yield to maturity of 4.508% and are due july 30, 2029. net proceeds of $694 million from the offering were used to reduce variable-rate debt, consisting of the partial repayment of $125 million of our unsecured senior bank term loan and the reduction of $569 million of borrowings that were outstanding on our unsecured senior line of credit. in connection with the partial repayment of $125 million of our unsecured senior bank term loan, we recognized a loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of a portion of unamortized loan fees aggregating $525 thousand.
all of these notes are unsecured obligations of the company and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by alexandria real estate equities, l.p., a 100% owned subsidiary of the company. these notes rank equally in right of payment with all other senior unsecured indebtedness. however, these notes are subordinated to existing and future mortgages and other secured indebtedness (to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness) and to all existing and future preferred equity and liabilities, whether secured or unsecured, of the company's subsidiaries, other than alexandria real estate equities, l.p.
in june 2015, we completed a $25.0 million partial repayment of unsecured senior bank term loan principal outstanding and extended the maturity of the remaining $350 million loan from july 31, 2015, to june 30, 2019, subject to our option to extend the maturity up to three times upon the satisfaction of certain conditions for an additional term of six months for the first and second extensions and for an additional term ending on january 15, 2021, for the third extension. in addition, we reduced the applicable margin with respect to borrowings outstanding under the loan to libor+1.10% from libor+1.20%. in conjunction with the amendment of our unsecured senior bank term loan ("2021 unsecured senior bank term loan") and the principal repayment, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt aggregating $189 thousand related to the write-off of a portion of unamortized loan fees.

secured construction loans refer to note 9 - "secured and unsecured senior debt" to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of our secured construction loans.
unsecured senior line of credit we use our unsecured senior line of credit to fund working capital, construction activities, and, from time to time, acquisition of properties. in july 2014, we completed a $700 million unsecured senior notes payable offering. net proceeds of $694 million from the offering were used to reduce variable-rate debt, consisting of the partial repayment of $125 million of our unsecured senior bank term loan and the reduction of $569 million of borrowings that were outstanding on our unsecured senior line of credit.
borrowings under the unsecured senior line of credit will bear interest at a "eurocurrency rate" or a "base rate" specified in the amended unsecured line of credit agreement plus, in either case, the applicable margin. the "eurocurrency rate" specified in the amended unsecured line of credit agreement is, as applicable, the rate per annum equal to (i) the libor or a successor rate thereto as approved by the administrative agent for loans denominated in a libor-quoted currency (i.e., u.s. dollars, euro, pounds sterling, or yen), (ii) the average annual yield rates applicable to canadian dollar bankers' acceptances for loans denominated in canadian dollars, (iii) the bank bill swap reference bid rate for loans denominated in australian dollars, or (iv) the rate designated with respect to the applicable alternative currency for loans denominated in a non-libor-quoted currency (other than canadian or australian dollars). the base rate means, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1.00%, (ii) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by bank of america as its "prime rate," and (iii) the eurocurrency rate plus 1.00%. our unsecured senior line of credit contains a feature that allows lenders to competitively bid on the interest rate for borrowings under the facility. this may result in an interest rate that is below the applicable margin of libor+1.10%. in addition to the cost of borrowing, the facility is subject to an annual facility fee of 0.20% based on the aggregate commitments.
cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $125.1 million and $86.0 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents. we expect existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operating activities, proceeds from asset sales, borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, secured construction loan borrowings, issuances of unsecured notes payable, and issuances of common stock to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, scheduled debt repayments, and certain capital expenditures, including expenditures related to construction activities.

"at the market" common stock offering program in december 2015, we established an "at the market" common stock offering program, under which we may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $450.0 million of our common stock through our various sales agents during a three-year period. the program was established to replace the prior "at the market" common stock offering program, which expired in june 2015. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we sold an aggregate of 889,856 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $80.3 million, or $90.29 per share, and net proceeds of approximately $78.5 million, including commissions and other expenses of approximately $1.8 million. the total number of 889,856 shares sold during the year consisted of 832,982 shares sold under our current "at the market program" established in december 2015, and 56,874 shares sold under our prior program that expired in june 2015. gross proceeds from sales of shares under our current program were approximately $75.0 million for the three months ended december 31, 2015. we used the net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock initially, to reduce outstanding balances on our unsecured senior line of credit and repay a portion of our senior unsecured term loan. borrowings under our line of credit fund general working capital and other corporate purposes, including selective development and redevelopment of properties and repayment of debt. as of december 31, 2015, the remaining aggregate proceeds that can be generated under our current program through the future stock sales were approximately $375.0 million. we used the proceeds from the sales to reduce amounts outstanding under our unsecured senior line of credit.
other sources under our current shelf registration statement filed with the sec, we may offer common stock, preferred stock, debt, and other securities. these securities may be issued from time to time at our discretion based on our needs and market conditions, including as necessary to balance our use of incremental debt capital.
we hold interests, together with certain third parties, in companies that we consolidate in our financial statements. these third parties may contribute equity into these entities primarily related to their share of funds for construction-related and financing-related activities.

uses of capital summary of capital expenditures our primary use of capital relates to the development, redevelopment, predevelopment, and construction of properties. we currently have projects in our visible growth pipeline aggregating 3.3 million rsf of office/laboratory and tech office space, including two unconsolidated real estate joint venture development projects. we incur capitalized construction costs related to development, redevelopment, predevelopment, and other construction activities. we also incur additional capitalized project costs, including interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the development or construction of a project during periods when activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are in progress. refer to "summary of capital expenditures" section under item 2 of this report for more information on our capital expenditures.
we capitalize interest cost as a cost of the project only during the period for which activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are ongoing, provided that expenditures for the asset have been made and interest cost has been incurred. capitalized interest for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, of $36.5 million and $47.1 million, respectively, is classified in investments in real estate. indirect project costs, including construction administration, legal fees, and office costs that clearly relate to projects under development or construction, are capitalized as incurred during the period an asset is undergoing activities to prepare it for its intended use. we capitalized payroll and other indirect project costs related to development, redevelopment, and construction projects aggregating approximately $12.4 million and $17.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the decrease in capitalized interest and payroll costs was primarily due to approximately 1.3 million rsf related to development and redevelopment projects placed into service since january 1, 2014. additionally, should we cease activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use, the interest, taxes, insurance, and certain other direct project costs related to this asset would be expensed as incurred. when construction activities cease, the asset is transferred out of cip and classified as rental property. also, if vertical aboveground construction is not initiated at completion of predevelopment activities, the land parcel will be classified as land held for future development. expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total expenses and net income. for example, had we experienced a 10% reduction in development, redevelopment, and construction activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, including interest and payroll, total expenses would have increased by approximately $4.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2015.
we also capitalize and defer initial direct costs to originate leases with independent third parties related to evaluating a prospective lessee's financial condition, negotiating lease terms, preparing the lease agreement, and closing the lease transaction. costs that we have capitalized and deferred relate to successful leasing transactions, result directly from and are essential to the lease transaction, and would not have been incurred had that leasing transaction not occurred. the initial direct costs capitalized and deferred also include the portion of our employees' total compensation and payroll-related fringe benefits directly related to time spent performing activities previously described and related to the respective lease that would not have been performed but for that lease. total initial direct leasing costs capitalized during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, were $67.5 million and $40.3 million, respectively, of which approximately $12.1 million and $10.6 million, respectively, represented capitalized and deferred payroll costs directly related and essential to our leasing activities during such periods. the increase in direct leasing costs in 2015 was driven by the highest leasing volume in alexandria's history, totaling approximately 5.0 million rsf.
acquisitions refer to the "external growth - acquisitions" section appearing elsewhere under this item 7 of this report for detailed information on our acquisitions.
unsecured senior bank term loan repayment in june 2015, we completed a partial principal repayment of $25.0 million and extended the maturity of the remaining $350 million 2021 unsecured senior bank term loan from july 31, 2015, to june 30, 2019, subject to our option to extend the maturity up to three times upon the satisfaction of certain conditions for an additional term of six months for the first and second extensions and for an additional term ending on january 15, 2021, for the third extension. in addition, we reduced the applicable interest rate margin with respect to borrowings outstanding under the loan to libor+1.10% from libor+1.20%. in conjunction with the amendment of our 2021 unsecured senior bank term loan and the principal repayment, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt aggregating $189 thousand related to the write-off of a portion of unamortized loan fees.

secured notes payable secured notes payable as of december 31, 2015, consisted of 13 notes secured by 29 properties. our secured notes payable typically require monthly payments of principal and interest and had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.84% as of december 31, 2015. as of december 31, 2015, the total book values of rental properties, land held for future development, and cip securing debt were approximately $1.7 billion. as of december 31, 2015, our secured notes payable, including unamortized discounts, were composed of approximately $400.2 million and $418.0 million of fixed-rate debt and variable-rate debt, respectively.
in october 2015, we repaid a $76.0 million secured note payable with an effective interest rate of 5.73%.
in january 2014, we repaid a $208.7 million secured note payable related to alexandria technology square® that bore interest at a rate of 5.59%. our real estate joint venture partner funded approximately $20.9 million of the proceeds required to repay the secured note payable.
estimated interest payments estimated interest payments on our fixed-rate debt and hedged variable-rate debt were calculated based upon contractual interest rates, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements, interest payment dates, and scheduled maturity dates. as of december 31, 2015, approximately 88% of our debt was fixed-rate debt or variable-rate debt subject to interest rate swap agreements. refer to our interest rate swap agreements in the "contractual obligations and commitments" and "interest rate swap agreements sections elsewhere in this item 7 for additional information. the remaining 12% of our debt as of december 31, 2015, was unhedged variable-rate debt based primarily on libor. interest payments on our unhedged variable-rate debt have been calculated based on interest rates in effect as of december 31, 2015. for additional information regarding our debt, refer to note 9 - "secured and unsecured senior debt," to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
interest rate swap agreements we utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured senior line of credit, unsecured senior bank term loans, and variable-rate construction loans. these agreements involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for our payment of fixed-rate amounts to the counterparty over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. interest received under all our interest rate swap agreements is based on the one-month libor. the net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense in our consolidated statements of income.
98
we have entered into master derivative agreements with each counterparty. these master derivative agreements (all of which are adapted from the standard international swaps and derivatives association, inc. form) define certain terms between us and each of our counterparties to address and minimize certain risks associated with our interest rate swap agreements. in order to limit our risk of non-performance by an individual counterparty under our interest rate swap agreements, these agreements are spread among various counterparties. as of december 31, 2015, the largest aggregate notional amount in effect at any single point in time with an individual counterparty under our interest rate swap agreements was $250 million. if one or more of our counterparties fail to perform under our interest rate swap agreements, we may incur higher costs associated with our variable-rate libor-based debt than the interest costs we originally anticipated. we have not posted any collateral related to our interest rate swap agreements.
other resources and liquidity requirements under our current shelf registration statement filed with the sec, we may offer common stock, preferred stock, debt, and other securities. these securities may be issued from time to time at our discretion based on our needs and market conditions, including as necessary to balance our use of incremental debt capital. we hold interests, together with certain third parties, in companies that we consolidate in our financial statements. these third parties may contribute equity into these entities primarily related to their share of funds for construction and financing-related activities.
ground lease obligations ground lease obligations as of december 31, 2015, included leases for 28 of our properties, which accounted for approximately 14% of our total number of properties and four land development parcels. excluding one ground lease related to one operating property that expires in 2036 with a net book value of $9.7 million as of december 31, 2015, our ground lease obligations have remaining lease terms ranging from approximately 40 to 100 years, including extension options. refer to note 14 - "commitments and contingencies," to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our ground leases.
commitments as of december 31, 2015, remaining aggregate costs under contract for the construction of properties undergoing development, redevelopment, and improvements under the terms of leases approximated $885.2 million. we expect payments for these obligations to occur over one to three years, subject to capital planning adjustments from time to time. we may have the ability to cease the construction of certain properties, which would result in the reduction of our commitments. we are also committed to funding approximately $87.6 million for certain non-real estate investments over the next several years. we have one unconsolidated real estate joint venture with a commitment to contribute our share of equity into this real estate joint venture to complete the development of buildings aggregating approximately 422,980 rsf by 2018. our share of estimated cost to complete this project is approximately $230 to $270 per square foot as of december 31, 2015. we have no obligation to provide additional funding to our other unconsolidated real estate joint venture.
we have minimum development requirements under project development agreements with government entities in india for some of our future value-creation projects. as of december 31, 2015, we had investments in real estate projects with an aggregate book value of $42.9 million for which we had construction commitment obligations to complete the development of buildings aggregating approximately 300,000 rsf, 100,000 rsf, and 200,000 rsf during 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. the estimated cost to develop these projects is approximately $125 to $175 per square foot. if we do not meet, extend, or eliminate these commitments, we may default under our existing agreements. the government entities, in turn, have certain obligations to us under those project development agreements. we are working with these entities to fulfill or amend certain existing obligations in a mutually beneficial manner.
in addition, we have letters of credit and performance obligations aggregating $28.4 million primarily related to our construction management requirements.
99
exposure to environmental liabilities in connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have obtained phase i environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues. the phase i environmental assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the phase i environmental assessments were completed. in addition, we carry a policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to certain environmental losses at substantially all of our properties.

cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily dependent on the occupancy level of our asset base, the rental rates of our leases, the collectability of rent and recovery of operating expenses from our tenants, the timing of completion of development projects, the timing of completion of redevelopment projects, and the timing of acquisitions of operating properties. net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2015, increased to $342.6 million, compared to $334.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities for the year ended december 31, 2015, increased by $23.3 million, or 6.7%, to $373.2 million, compared to $350.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our total noi of $76.9 million, or 15.1%, to $585.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to $508.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, as a result of our highly leased development and redevelopment projects being placed into service subsequent to january 1, 2014, partially offset by an increase in interest expense, which reflects a decrease in the amount of interest capitalized as a result of our development and redevelopment projects placed into service as noted above.

$243,090                  $228,271           $14,819
the increase in dividends paid on our common stock was primarily due to an increase in the related dividends to $3.02 per common share for the year ended december 31, 2015, from $2.82 per common share for the year ended december 31, 2014.
inflation as of december 31, 2015, approximately 96% of our leases (on an rsf basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. approximately 95% of our leases (on an rsf basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from 3.0% to 3.5%) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other indices. accordingly, we do not believe that our cash flows or earnings from real estate operations are subject to significant risks from inflation. an increase in inflation, however, could result in an increase in the cost of our variable-rate borrowings, including borrowings related to our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans.
102
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. we base these estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
we continually evaluate the policies and estimates we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. changes in estimates or policies applied could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by our stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts, and lenders in their evaluation of our performance. our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 - "basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
reit compliance we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code to our operations and financial results, and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. we believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code to enable us to qualify, and continue to qualify, as a reit. however, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a reit, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify.
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal and state income taxes (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. if we lose our reit status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to our stockholders will be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we will no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders.
investments in real estate and properties classified as "held for sale"
we recognize real estate acquired (including the intangible value of above-or below-market leases, acquired in-place leases, tenant relationships, and other intangible assets or liabilities), liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in an acquired entity at their fair value as of the acquisition date. if there is a bargain fixed-rate renewal option for the period beyond the non-cancelable lease term of an in-place lease, we evaluate factors such as the business conditions in the industry in which the lessee operates, the economic conditions in the area in which the property is located, and the ability of the lessee to sublease the property during the renewal term, in order to determine the likelihood that the lessee will renew. when we determine there is reasonable assurance that such bargain purchase option will be exercised, we consider its impact in determining the intangible value of such lease and its related amortization period. the value of tangible assets acquired is based upon our estimation of value on an "as if vacant" basis. the value of acquired in-place leases includes the estimated costs during the hypothetical lease-up period and other costs that would have been incurred in the execution of similar leases under the market conditions at the acquisition date of the acquired in-place lease. we assess the fair value of tangible and intangible assets based on numerous factors, including estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors, including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property. we also recognize the fair values of assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in acquisitions of less than a 100% interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity. acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition of businesses, including real estate acquired with in-place leases, are expensed as incurred.
the values allocated to buildings and building improvements, land improvements, tenant improvements, and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis using the shorter of the term of the respective ground lease and up to 40 years for buildings and building improvements, an estimated life up to 20 years for land improvements, the respective lease term for tenant improvements, and the estimated useful life for equipment. the values of acquired above-or below-market leases are amortized over the terms of the related leases and recognized as either an increase (for below-market leases) or a decrease (for above-market leases) to rental income. the values of acquired in-place leases are classified in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases.
103
a property is classified as "held for sale" when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (i) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property; (ii) the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary; (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell have been initiated; (iv) the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within one year; (v) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (vi) actions necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. depreciation of assets ceases upon designation of a property as "held for sale." if a property classified as "held for sale" no longer meets the criteria above, it is reclassified as "held for use" with catch-up depreciation recognized as if the asset has been in service since it was classified as "held for sale."
if the disposal of the property represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on our operations or financial results, such as (i) a major line of business, (ii) a major geographic area, (iii) a major equity method investment, or (iv) other major parts of an entity, then the operations of the property "held for sale," including any interest expense directly attributable to it, are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income, and amounts for all prior periods presented are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations. the disposal of an individual property generally will not represent a strategic shift and therefore will typically not meet the criteria for classification as discontinued operations.
impairment of long-lived assets on a quarterly basis, we review current activities and changes in the business conditions of all of our properties prior to and subsequent to the end of each quarter to determine the existence of any triggering events requiring an impairment analysis. if triggering events are identified, we review an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows for the properties, including a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration.
long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, cip, land held for development, and intangibles, are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist that may indicate that the amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. the amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. impairment indicators or triggering events for long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, cip, and land held for development, are assessed by project and include significant fluctuations in estimated revenue less rental operating expense, occupancy changes, significant near-term lease expirations, current and historical operating and/or cash flow losses, construction costs, estimated completion dates, rental rates, and other market factors. we assess the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, construction costs, available market information, current and historical operating results, known trends, current market/economic conditions that may affect the property, and our assumptions about the use of the asset, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration. upon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-down is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value. if an impairment loss is not required to be recognized, the recognition of depreciation is adjusted prospectively, as necessary, to reduce the carrying amount of the real estate to its estimated disposition value over the remaining period that the real estate is expected to be held and used. we may adjust depreciation of properties that are expected to be disposed of or redeveloped prior to the end of their useful lives.
we use the "held for sale" impairment model for our properties classified as "held for sale." the "held for sale" impairment model is different from the held and used impairment model. under the "held for sale" impairment model, an impairment loss is recognized if the amount of the long-lived asset classified as "held for sale" exceeds its fair value less cost to sell.
capitalization of costs we are required to capitalize project costs, including predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the development, redevelopment, predevelopment, or construction of a project. capitalization of development, redevelopment, predevelopment, and construction costs is required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, predevelopment, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total expenses and net income. costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred. should development, redevelopment, predevelopment, or construction activity cease, interest, property taxes, insurance, and certain other costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization and would be expensed as incurred. expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
we also capitalize costs directly related and essential to our leasing activities. these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. costs related to unsuccessful leasing opportunities are expensed as incurred.
104
investments we hold equity investments in certain publicly traded companies and investments in certain privately held entities and limited partnerships primarily involved in the science and technology industries. all of our investments in actively traded public companies are considered "available-for-sale" and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value. fair value has been determined based upon the closing price as of each balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses shown as a separate component of comprehensive income. the classification of each investment is determined at the time each investment is made, and such determination is reevaluated at each balance sheet date. the cost of each investment sold is determined by the specific identification method, with realized gains or losses classified in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the cost method when our interest in the entity is so minor that we have virtually no influence over the entity's operating and financial policies. certain investments in privately held entities are accounted for under the equity method unless our interest in the entity is deemed to be so minor that we have virtually no influence over the entity's operating and financial policies. under the equity method of accounting, we recognize our investment initially at cost and adjust the amount of the investment to recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the date of our investment. additionally, we limit our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity to less than 10%. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity was less than 10%.
we monitor each of our equity investments throughout the year for new developments, including operating results, results of clinical trials, capital-raising events, and mergers and acquisitions activities. individual investments are evaluated for impairment when changes in conditions may indicate an impairment exists. the factors that we consider in making these assessments include, but are not limited to, market prices, market conditions, available financing, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives, and new collaborative agreements. if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that might have an adverse effect on our cost method investments, we do not estimate the investment's fair value. for all of our investments, if a decline in the fair value of an investment below the carrying value is determined to be other than temporary, such investment is written down to its estimated fair value with a charge to current earnings.
interest rate swap agreements we are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions. we principally manage our exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of our core business activities. we manage economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding and by entering into interest rate swap agreements. specifically, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. our interest rate swap agreements are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of our known or expected cash payments principally related to our borrowings based on libor. we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes, and currently all of our derivatives are designated as hedges. our objectives in using interest rate swap agreements are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements in accordance with our interest rate risk management strategy. all of our interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the company's making fixed-rate payments over the life of the interest rate swap agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount of interest rate swap agreements.
we utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with borrowings based on libor. we recognize our interest rate swap agreements as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value. the accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship. for those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based on the hedged exposure, as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. our interest rate swap agreements are considered cash flow hedges because they are designated and qualify as hedges of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows. hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the earnings effect of the hedged transactions in a cash flow hedge. all of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed "highly effective" in reducing our exposure to variable interest rates. we formally document all relationships between interest rate swap agreements and hedged items, including the method for evaluating effectiveness and the risk strategy. we make an assessment at the inception of each interest rate swap agreement and on an ongoing basis to determine whether these instruments are "highly effective" in offsetting changes in cash flows associated with the hedged items. the ineffective portion of each interest rate swap agreement is immediately recognized in earnings. while we intend to continue to meet the conditions for such hedge accounting, if swaps did not qualify as "highly effective," the changes in the fair values of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings.
105
the effective portion of changes in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements that are designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). amounts classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings.
the fair value of each interest rate swap agreement is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analyses on the expected cash flows of each derivative. these analyses reflect the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and use observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. the fair values of our interest rate swap agreements are determined using the market-standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed-cash payments and the discounted expected variable-cash receipts. the variable-cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. the fair value calculation also includes an amount for risk of non-performance of our counterparties using "significant unobservable inputs" such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default, which we have determined to be insignificant to the overall fair value of our interest rate swap agreements.
recognition of rental income and tenant recoveries rental income from leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms. we classify amounts currently recognized as income and expected to be received in later years as deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. amounts received currently but recognized as income in future years are classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and tenant security deposits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. we commence recognition of rental income at the date the property is ready for its intended use and the tenant takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property.
tenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period during which the applicable expenses are incurred.
tenant receivables consist primarily of amounts due for contractual lease payments, reimbursements of common area maintenance expenses, property taxes, and other expenses recoverable from tenants. tenant receivables are expected to be collected within one year. we may maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make payments required under the terms of the lease and for tenant recoveries due. if a tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of uncollectible rent and deferred rent receivables arising from the straight-lining of rent. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, no allowance for uncollectible tenant receivables and deferred rent was deemed necessary.
as of december 31, 2015, approximately 96% of our leases (on an rsf basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. approximately 95% of our leases (on an rsf basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed or based on a consumer price index or another index. additionally, approximately 94% of our leases (on an rsf basis) provided for the recapture of certain capital expenditures.
monitoring tenant credit quality during the term of each lease, we monitor the credit quality of our tenants by (i) reviewing the credit rating of tenants that are rated by a nationally recognized credit rating agency, (ii) reviewing financial statements of the tenants that are publicly available or that are required to be delivered to us pursuant to the applicable lease, (iii) monitoring news reports regarding our tenants and their respective businesses, and (iv) monitoring the timeliness of lease payments. we have a team of employees who, among them, have graduate and undergraduate degrees in biology, chemistry, and industrial biotechnology and experience in the science and technology industries, as well as in finance. our research team is responsible for assessing and monitoring the credit quality of our tenants and any material changes in credit quality.
106
non-gaap measures ffo and ffo, as adjusted (attributable to alexandria's common stockholders)
gaap-basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes that real estate values diminish over time. in an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets, the nareit board of governors established the measurement tool of ffo. since its introduction, ffo has become a widely used non-gaap financial measure among equity reits. we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity reit. moreover, we believe that ffo, as adjusted, allows investors to compare our performance to the performance of other real estate companies on a consistent basis, without having to account for differences caused by investment and disposition decisions, financing decisions, terms of securities, capital structures, and capital market transactions. we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the nareit board of governors in its april 2002 white paper and related implementation guidance ("the nareit white paper"). the nareit white paper defines ffo as net income (computed in accordance with gaap), excluding gains (losses) from sales of depreciable real estate and land parcels and impairments of depreciable real estate (excluding land parcels), plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for our share of consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and real estate joint ventures. impairments of real estate relate to decreases in the fair value of real estate due to changes in general market conditions and do not necessarily reflect the operating performance of the properties during the corresponding period. impairments of real estate represent the write-down of assets when fair value over the recoverability period is less than the carrying value. we compute ffo, as adjusted, as ffo calculated in accordance with the nareit white paper less/plus significant gains/losses on the sale of investments, plus losses on early extinguishment of debt, preferred stock redemption charges, impairments of non-depreciable real estate and land parcels, impairments of investments, deal costs, and the amount of such items that is allocable to our unvested restricted stock awards. our calculations of ffo and ffo, as adjusted, may differ from those methodologies utilized by other equity reits for similar performance measurements and, accordingly, may not be comparable to those of other equity reits. neither ffo nor ffo, as adjusted, should be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) (determined in accordance with gaap) as an indication of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with gaap) as a measure of liquidity, nor are they indicative of the availability of funds for our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions.
affo attributable to alexandria's common stockholders affo is a non-gaap financial measure that we use as a supplemental measure of our performance. we compute affo, to include our share of amounts from consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, by adding to or deducting from ffo, as adjusted: (i) non-revenue-enhancing building improvements (excluding amounts recoverable from our tenants), non-revenue-enhancing tenant improvements and leasing commissions (excluding revenue-enhancing and development and redevelopment expenditures); (ii) effects of straight-line rent revenue and straight-line rent expense on ground leases; (iii) capitalized income from development projects; (iv) amortization of acquired above- and below-market leases, loan fees, and debt premiums/discounts; (v) stock compensation expense; and (vi) allocation of affo attributable to unvested restricted stock awards.
we believe that affo is a useful supplemental performance measure because it further adjusts ffo to (i) deduct certain expenditures that, although capitalized and classified in depreciation expense, do not enhance the revenue or cash flows of our properties; (ii) eliminate the effect of straight-lining our rental income and capitalizing income from development projects; and (iii) eliminate the effect of items that are not indicative of our core operations and that do not actually reduce the amount of cash generated by our operations. we believe that eliminating the effect of charges related to share-based compensation facilitates a comparison of our operations across periods and among other equity reits without the variances caused by different valuation methodologies, the volatility of the expense (which depends on market forces outside our control), and the assumptions and the variety of award types that a company can use. we believe that affo provides useful information by excluding certain items that are not representative of our core operating results because such items are dependent upon historical costs or subject to judgmental valuation inputs and the timing of our decisions.
affo is not intended to represent cash flow for the period and is intended only to provide an additional measure of performance. we believe that net income attributable to alexandria's common stockholders is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to affo. we believe that affo is a widely recognized measure of the operations of equity reits, and presenting affo will enable investors to assess our performance in comparison to other equity reits. however, other equity reits may use different methodologies for calculating affo, and accordingly, our affo may not be comparable to affo calculated by other equity reits. affo should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with gaap) as an indication of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with gaap) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions.

adjusted ebitda ebitda represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, a non-gaap financial measure, and is used by us and others as a supplemental measure of performance. we use adjusted ebitda to assess the performance of our core operations, including our pro rata share of amounts from consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, for financial and operational decision making, and as a supplemental or additional means of evaluating period-to-period comparisons on a consistent basis. adjusted ebitda is calculated as ebitda, excluding stock compensation expense, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, and impairments. we believe adjusted ebitda provides investors relevant and useful information because it permits investors to view income from our operations on an unleveraged basis before the effects of taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, and impairments, including our share from our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. by excluding interest expense and gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, ebitda and adjusted ebitda allow investors to measure our performance independent of our capital structure and indebtedness and, therefore, allow for a more meaningful comparison of our performance to that of other companies, both in the real estate industry and in other industries. we believe that excluding charges related to share-based compensation facilitates a comparison of our operations across periods and among other equity reits without the variances caused by different valuation methodologies, the volatility of the expense (which depends on market forces outside our control), and the assumptions and the variety of award types that a company can use. we believe that adjusting for the effects of gains or losses on sales of real estate and impairments provides useful information by excluding certain items that are not representative of our core operating results. these items are dependent upon historical costs and are subject to judgmental inputs and the timing of our decisions. ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as measures of our performance. ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. while ebitda and adjusted ebitda are relevant and widely used measures of performance, they do not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by gaap, and they should not be considered as alternatives to those indicators in evaluating performance or liquidity. further, our computation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.
the following table reconciles net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, to ebitda and adjusted ebitda (in thousands):

adjusted ebitda margins we calculate adjusted ebitda margins by dividing adjusted ebitda by total revenues. because our total revenues exclude revenues from discontinued operations, for purposes of calculating the margin ratio, we exclude the adjusted ebitda from our discontinued operations for each period presented. we believe excluding adjusted ebitda for discontinued operations improves the consistency and comparability of the adjusted ebitda margins from period to period. likewise, our adjusted ebitda is presented on a pro rata basis, to include our share of adjusted ebitda from consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. therefore, revenues are presented with only our pro rata share of revenues from consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures to improve the consistency and comparability from period-to-period.

annualized base rent annualized base rent means the annualized fixed base rental amount in effect as of the end of the period, related to our operating rsf (using rental revenue computed on a straight-line basis in accordance with gaap). abr and measures computed using abr are presented at 100% for all properties under our management, including properties held by our consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures.
class a assets and aaa locations class a assets are properties clustered in aaa locations that provide innovative tenants with high-quality, dynamic, and collaborative ecosystems that enhance their ability to successfully recruit and retain world-class talent and inspire productivity, efficiency, creativity, and success. class a assets generally command higher abr than other classes of properties.
aaa locations are in close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, knowledge, institutions, and related businesses. such locations are characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for tenants, and a limited supply of available space.
fixed charge coverage ratio fixed charge coverage ratio is the ratio of adjusted ebitda to fixed charges. this ratio is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of our ability to satisfy financing obligations and preferred stock dividends. we compute the fixed charge coverage ratio, on a pro rata basis, to include only our share of amounts from consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with gaap, plus capitalized interest, less amortization of loan fees and amortization of debt (premiums) discounts. the fixed charge coverage ratio calculation below is not directly comparable to the computations of "consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges and earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends" included in exhibit 12.1 to this report as of december 31, 2015 and incorporated herein by reference.

initial stabilized yield is calculated as the quotient of the estimated amounts of noi at stabilization and our investment in the property. our initial stabilized yield excludes the impact of leverage. our cash rents related to our value-creation projects are expected to increase over time, and our average cash yields are expected, in general, to be greater than our initial stabilized yields (cash basis). our estimates for initial stabilized yields, initial stabilized yields (cash basis), and total costs at completion represent our initial estimates at the commencement of the project. we expect to update this information upon completion of the project, or sooner, if there are significant changes to the expected project yields or costs.
•   initial stabilized yield reflects rental income, including contractual rent escalations and any rent concessions over the term(s) of the lease(s), calculated on a straight-line basis.
•   initial stabilized yield (cash basis) reflects cash rents at the stabilization date after initial rental concessions, if any, have elapsed.
average cash yield reflects cash rents, including contractual rent escalations after initial rental concessions have elapsed, calculated on a straight-line basis.

net debt to adjusted ebitda net debt to adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a supplemental measure in evaluating our balance sheet leverage. we compute the net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio, on a pro rata basis, to include only our share of amounts from consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. net debt is equal to the sum of total consolidated debt less cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. refer to "adjusted ebitda" for further information on the calculation of adjusted ebitda.

noi noi is a non-gaap financial measure equal to income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable gaap financial measure, excluding loss on early extinguishment of debt, impairment of real estate, depreciation and amortization, interest, and general and administrative expense. these amounts are presented to include our pro rata share of amounts from consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. we believe noi provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it primarily reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. therefore, we believe noi is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets, including our pro rata share of amounts from consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. noi on a cash basis is noi adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent and amortization of below-market lease revenue adjustments required by gaap. we believe that noi on a cash basis is helpful to investors as an additional measure of operating performance because it eliminates straight-line rent and amortization of below-market lease revenue adjustments to rental revenue.
further, we believe noi is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, noi reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, which provides a perspective not immediately apparent from income from continuing operations. noi can be used to measure the initial stabilized yields of our properties by calculating the quotient of noi generated by a property on a straight-line basis, and our investment in the property, excluding the impact of leverage. noi excludes certain components from income from continuing operations in order to provide results that are more closely related to the results of operations of our properties. for example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level rather than at the property level. in addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. impairments of real estate have been excluded in deriving noi because we do not consider impairments of real estate to be property-level operating expenses. impairments of real estate relate to changes in the values of our assets and do not reflect the current operating performance with respect to related revenues or expenses. our impairments of real estate represent the write-down in the value of the assets to the estimated fair value less cost to sell. these impairments result from investing decisions and the deterioration in market conditions that adversely impact underlying real estate values. our calculation of noi also excludes charges incurred from changes in certain financing decisions, such as losses on early extinguishment of debt, as these charges often relate to the timing of corporate strategy. property operating expenses that are included in determining noi consist of costs that are related to our operating properties, such as utilities, repairs and maintenance; rental expense related to ground leases; contracted services, such as janitorial, engineering, and landscaping; property taxes and insurance; and property-level salaries. general and administrative expenses consist primarily of accounting and corporate compensation, corporate insurance, professional fees, office rent, and office supplies that are incurred as part of corporate office management. noi presented by us may not be comparable to noi reported by other equity reits, which may define noi differently. we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, noi should be examined in conjunction with income from continuing operations as presented in our consolidated statements of income. noi should not be considered as an alternative to income from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or our ability to make distributions.
operating statistics we present certain operating statistics related to our properties that include number of properties, abr, abr per occupied rsf, occupancy, rsf, leasing activity, rental rates, and contractual lease expirations. we believe these measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of certain trends for our properties. we compute operating statistics at 100% for all properties managed by us, including properties owned by our consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures.
pro rata information we present certain items, including noi, same properties noi, and unencumbered noi, on a pro rata basis. we believe this information is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of operating performance because it provides greater detail of the results most impacting to our common stockholders. moreover, this information provides our share of investments in real estate from all properties, including our share of the assets and liabilities of our real estate joint ventures. this information also allows investors to understand the impact of real estate joint ventures investments and debt on our business.
in addition, we present certain credit metrics, including adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margins, net debt to adjusted ebitda, and fixed charge coverage ratios, on a pro rata basis. we believe this information is useful to investors as a supplemental measure because it excludes amounts that may not be available to our common stockholders.

same properties noi refer to the discussion of same properties and reconciliation of noi to income from continuing operations in "results of operations."
our share of unencumbered noi as a percentage of total net operating income our share of unencumbered noi as a percentage of total net operating income is a non-gaap financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a performance measure of the results of operations of our unencumbered real estate assets; as it primarily reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the unencumbered property level. we use our share of unencumbered noi as a percentage of total net operating income in order to assess our compliance with our financial covenants under our debt obligations because the measure serves as a proxy for a financial measure under such debt obligations. our share of unencumbered noi is derived from assets classified in continuing operations, including our pro rata share of amounts from consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, which are not subject to any mortgage, deed of trust, lien, or other security interest; as of the period for which income is presented. refer to the reconciliation of noi to income from continuing operations in "results of operations."

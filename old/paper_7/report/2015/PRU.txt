item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the forward-looking statements included below the table of contents, "risk factors," "selected financial data" and the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
overview from december 18, 2001, the date of demutualization, through december 31, 2014, we organized our principal operations into the financial services businesses and the closed block business, and had two classes of common stock outstanding. the common stock, which is publicly-traded (nyse:pru), reflected the performance of the financial services businesses, while the class b stock, which was issued through a private placement and did not trade on any exchange, reflected the performance of the closed block business.
on january 2, 2015, prudential financial repurchased and canceled all of the shares of the class b stock (the "class b repurchase"). as a result, earnings per share of common stock for the year ended december 31, 2015 reflect the consolidated earnings of prudential financial. in addition, we no longer organize our principal operations into the financial services businesses and the closed block business. our principal operations are comprised of four divisions, which together encompass seven segments, and our corporate and other operations. the u.s. retirement solutions and investment management division consists of our individual annuities, retirement and asset management segments. the u.s. individual life and group insurance division consists of our individual life and group insurance segments. the international insurance division consists of our international insurance segment. the closed block division consists of our closed block segment, which includes certain in force participating insurance and annuity products and corresponding assets that are used for the payment of benefits and policyholders' dividends on these products (the "closed block"), as well as certain related assets and liabilities. the closed block segment is accounted for as a divested business that is reported separately from the divested businesses that are included in corporate and other operations. our corporate and other operations include corporate items and initiatives that are not allocated to business segments and businesses that have been or will be divested. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the closed block.
as a result of the class b repurchase and resulting elimination of the separation of the financial services businesses and the closed block business, in this md&a we refer to the divisions and segments of the company that formerly comprised the financial services businesses as "pfi excluding the closed block division" and we refer to the operations that were formerly included in the closed block business as the "closed block division," except as otherwise noted. closed block business results were associated with the company's class b stock for periods prior to january 1, 2015.

revenues and expenses we earn our revenues principally from insurance premiums; mortality, expense, asset management and administrative fees from insurance and investment products; and investment of general account and other funds. we earn premiums primarily from the sale of certain individual life insurance, group life and disability insurance, retirement and annuity contracts. we earn mortality, expense, and asset management fees primarily from the sale and servicing of separate account products including variable life insurance and variable annuities, and from the sale and servicing of other products including universal life insurance. we also earn asset management and administrative fees from the distribution, servicing and management of mutual funds, retirement products and other asset management products and services. our operating expenses principally consist of insurance benefits provided and reserves established for anticipated future insurance benefits, general business expenses, dividends to policyholders, commissions and other costs of selling and servicing our products and interest credited on general account liabilities.
profitability our profitability depends principally on our ability to price our insurance and annuity products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the costs associated with providing benefits and administering those products. profitability also depends on, among other items, our actuarial and policyholder behavior experience on insurance and annuity products and our ability to attract and retain customer assets, generate and maintain favorable investment results, effectively deploy capital and utilize our tax capacity, and manage expenses.
historically, the participating products included in the closed block have yielded lower returns on capital invested than many of our other businesses. as we have ceased offering domestic participating products, we expect that the proportion of the traditional participating products in our in force business will gradually diminish as these older policies age, and we grow other businesses. however, the relatively lower returns to us on this existing block of business will continue to affect our consolidated results of operations for many years.
see "risk factors" for a discussion of risks that have affected and may affect in the future our business, results of operations or financial condition, or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company.
executive summary industry trends our u.s. and international businesses are impacted by financial markets, economic conditions, regulatory oversight, and a variety of trends that affect the industries where we compete.
u.s. businesses financial and economic environment. global market conditions and uncertainty continue to be factors in the markets in which we operate. as discussed further under "impact of a low interest rate environment" below, interest rates in the u.s. remain lower than historical levels, which continue to negatively impact our portfolio income yields and our net investment spread results.
regulatory environment. see "business-regulation" for a discussion of regulatory developments that may impact the company, including the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and the u.s. department of labor's proposed fiduciary rules. see "risk factors-regulatory and legal risks" for a discussion of the risks associated with these and other developments.
demographics. income protection, wealth accumulation and the needs of retiring baby boomers continue to shape the insurance industry. retirement security is one of the most critical issues in the u.s. for individuals and the investment professionals and institutions that support them. the risk and responsibility of retirement savings continues to shift to employees, away from the government and employers. life insurance ownership among u.s. households remains low, with consumers citing other financial priorities and cost of insurance as reasons for the lack of coverage.
competitive environment. see "business-competition," "business-u.s. retirement solutions and investment management division" and "business-u.s. individual life and group insurance division" for a discussion of the competitive environment and the basis on which we compete.
54
international businesses financial and economic environment. our international insurance operations, especially in japan, continue to operate in a low interest rate environment. although the local market in japan has adapted to the low interest rate environment, as discussed under "impact of a low interest rate environment" below, the current reinvestment yields for certain blocks of business in our international insurance operations are now generally lower than the current portfolio yield supporting these blocks of business, which may negatively impact our net investment spread results. the continued low interest rate environment in the u.s. may also impact the relative attractiveness of u.s. dollar-denominated products to yen-denominated products in japan. in addition, we are subject to financial impacts associated with movements in foreign currency rates, particularly the japanese yen. fluctuations in the value of the yen will continue to impact the relative attractiveness of both yen-denominated and non-yen denominated products.
regulatory environment. see "business-regulation" and "risk factors-regulatory and legal risks" for a discussion of regulatory developments that may impact the company and associated risks.
demographics. japan has an aging population as well as a large pool of household assets invested in low-yielding deposit and savings vehicles. the aging of japan's population, along with strains on government pension programs, have led to a growing demand for insurance products with a significant savings element to meet savings and retirement needs as the population prepares for retirement. we are seeing a similar shift to retirement-oriented products across asian markets, including korea and taiwan, each of which also has an aging population.
competitive environment. see "business-competition," and "business-international insurance division" for a discussion of the competitive environment and the basis on which we compete.
impact of a low interest rate environment u.s. operations excluding the closed block division interest rates in the u.s. continue to remain lower than historical levels, despite the federal reserve board's decision to raise short-term interest rates in december 2015. our current reinvestment yields continue to be lower than the overall portfolio yield, primarily for our investments in fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans.
for the general account supporting our u.s. retirement solutions and investment management division, our u.s. individual life and group insurance division and our corporate and other operations, we expect annual scheduled payments and prepayments to be approximately 10% of the fixed maturity security and commercial mortgage loan portfolios through 2017. the general account for these operations has approximately $168 billion of such assets (based on net carrying value) as of december 31, 2015. as these assets mature, the current average portfolio yield for fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loans of approximately 4.5%, as of december 31, 2015, is expected to decline due to reinvesting in a lower interest rate environment. included in the $168 billion of fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans are approximately $83 billion that are subject to call or redemption features at the issuer's option and have a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5%.
as of december 31, 2015, approximately 75% of these assets contain provisions for prepayment premiums. the reinvestment of scheduled payments and prepayments at rates below the current portfolio yield, including in some cases at rates below those guaranteed under our insurance contracts, will impact future operating results to the extent we do not, or are unable to, reduce crediting rates on in force blocks of business, or effectively utilize other asset/liability management strategies described below, in order to maintain current net interest margins.
as of december 31, 2015, these operations have approximately $171 billion of insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances. of this amount, approximately $52 billion represents contracts with crediting rates that may be adjusted over the life of the contract, subject to guaranteed minimums. although we may have the ability to lower crediting rates for those contracts above guaranteed minimums, our willingness to do so may be limited by competitive pressures.
the following table sets forth the related account values by range of guaranteed minimum crediting rates and the related range of the difference, in basis points ("bps"), between rates being credited to contractholders as of december 31, 2015, and the respective guaranteed minimums.

also included in the table above is approximately $1.4 billion related to contracts that impose a market value adjustment if the invested amount is not held to maturity.
these operations also have approximately $15 billion of insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances representing participating contracts for which the investment income risk is expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. the crediting rates for these contracts are periodically adjusted based on the yield earned on the related assets. the remaining $104 billion of the $171 billion of insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances in these operations represents long-duration products such as group annuities, structured settlements and other insurance products that have fixed and guaranteed terms, for which underlying assets may have to be reinvested at interest rates that are lower than portfolio rates. we seek to mitigate the impact of a prolonged low interest rate environment on these contracts through asset/liability management, as discussed further below.
assuming a hypothetical scenario where the average 10-year u.s. treasury rate is 2.25% for the period from january 1, 2016 through december 31, 2017, and credit spreads remain unchanged from levels as of december 31, 2015, we estimate that the unfavorable impact to net interest margins included in pre-tax adjusted operating income of reinvesting in such an environment, compared to reinvesting at current average portfolio yields, would be approximately $20 million in 2016 and $55 million in 2017. this impact is most significant in the retirement, individual life and individual annuities segments. this hypothetical scenario only reflects the impact related to the approximately $52 billion of contracts shown in the table above, and does not reflect: i) any benefit from potential changes to the crediting rates on the corresponding contractholder liabilities where the company has the contractual ability to do so, or other potential mitigants such as changes in investment mix that we may implement as funds are reinvested; ii) any impact related to assets that do not directly support our liabilities; iii) any impact from other factors, including but not limited to, new business, contractholder behavior, changes in competitive conditions, and changes in capital markets; or iv) any impact from other factors described below.
in order to mitigate the unfavorable impact that the current interest rate environment has on our net interest margins, we employ a proactive asset/liability management program, which includes strategic asset allocation and derivative strategies within a disciplined risk management framework. these strategies seek to match the characteristics of our products, and to closely approximate the interest rate sensitivity of the assets with the estimated interest rate sensitivity of the product liabilities. our asset/liability management program also helps manage duration gaps, currency and other risks between assets and liabilities through the use of derivatives. we adjust this dynamic process as products change, as customer behavior changes and as changes in the market environment occur. as a result, our asset/liability management process has permitted us to manage the interest rate risk associated with our products through several market cycles. our interest rate exposure is also mitigated by our business mix, which includes lines of business for which fee-based and insurance underwriting earnings play a more prominent role in product profitability.
closed block division substantially all of the $60 billion of general account assets in the closed block division support obligations and liabilities relating to the closed block policies only. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the closed block.
56
international insurance operations while our international insurance operations have experienced a low interest rate environment for many years, the current reinvestment yields for certain blocks of business in our largest insurance operations are generally lower than the current portfolio yield supporting these blocks of business. for example, if interest rates on investments supporting our japanese operations, including those sold in currencies other than japanese yen, remain below the current yield on investments supporting these blocks of business, reinvestment at such rates will negatively impact future operating results. as of december 31, 2015, our japanese operations have $121 billion of insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances. included in the $121 billion is approximately $21 billion related to contracts that impose a market value adjustment if the invested amount is not held to maturity, and $8 billion of insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances with crediting rates that may be adjusted over the life of the contract, subject to guaranteed minimums. however, for these contracts, most of the current crediting rates are at or near contractual minimums. although we have the ability to lower crediting rates in some cases for those contracts that are above guaranteed minimum crediting rates, the majority of this business has interest crediting rates that are determined by formula. the remaining $92 billion of insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances are predominantly comprised of long-duration insurance products that have fixed and guaranteed terms, for which underlying assets may have to be reinvested at interest rates that are lower than portfolio rates. our international insurance operations employ a proactive asset/liability management program in order to mitigate, to the extent possible, the unfavorable impact that the current interest rate environment has on our net interest margins. this asset/liability management program includes strategies similar to those described above for u.s. insurance operations excluding the closed block division.
outlook management expects that results in 2016 will continue to reflect the quality of our individual businesses and their prospects, as well as our overall business mix and effective capital management. we also expect our results to continue to reflect the impacts of product diversification strategies we have implemented over the last few years, particularly in our individual annuities and individual life businesses, and to include seasonally-higher expenses in the fourth quarter and seasonally-lower international insurance income in the second half of the year. our strategic initiatives will continue to focus on growth opportunities, enhanced capital and risk management, and further developing our digital, data and infrastructure capabilities and cross-business synergies. in addition, initiatives for each of our divisions include the following:
•   u.s. retirement and investment management market. we will continue to seek to capitalize on the growing need of baby boomers for products that provide guaranteed income for longer retirement periods, and to focus on our clients' increasing needs for retirement income security. we will also seek to provide products that respond to the needs of plan sponsors to manage risk and control their benefit costs, while ensuring we maintain appropriate pricing and return expectations under changing market conditions. in addition, in 2016, we expect to recapture the risks related to our variable annuity living benefit riders that were previously reinsured to a captive reinsurance company, and begin managing all of the product risks associated with our variable annuities in our statutory insurance entities. we expect this recapture to reduce the capital volatility associated with our individual annuities business.
•   u.s. insurance market. we will continue to focus on writing high-quality business and expect to continue to benefit from expansion of our distribution channels and deepening our relationships with third-party distributors. in our individual life business, we expect to continue to work with regulators on long-term solutions to finance new statutory reserve requirements for our term and universal life policies. we will also seek to capitalize on opportunities for additional voluntary life purchases in the group insurance market, as institutional clients are focused on controlling their benefit costs.
•   international markets. we will continue to concentrate on deepening our presence in the markets in which we currently operate, such as japan, and expanding our distribution capabilities in emerging markets. we will also seek to capitalize on opportunities arising in international markets as changing demographics and public policy continue to contribute to a growing demand for retirement income products. in particular, in 2016, we expect to close on our acquisition of an indirect ownership interest in administradora de fondos de pensiones habitat s.a. ("afp habitat"), a leading provider of retirement services in chile. we also plan to create a presence in africa by investing in a private equity fund that will primarily invest in african life insurers over the next three to five years.
results of operations net income attributable to prudential financial, inc. for the year ended december 31, 2015 was $5,642 million compared to $1,381 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 and a net loss of $(667) million for the year ended december 31, 2013.

we analyze performance of our segments and corporate and other operations using a measure called adjusted operating income. as discussed in "-overview," for the year ended december 31, 2015, the closed block division is accounted for as a divested business under our definition of adjusted operating income. for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, the former closed block business was analyzed using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("u.s. gaap"). under both the current reporting for the closed block division and the former reporting for the closed block business, its results are excluded from adjusted operating income. see "-consolidated results of operations-segment measures" for a discussion of adjusted operating income and its use as a measure of segment operating performance.
shown below are the contributions of each segment and corporate and other operations to our adjusted operating income for the periods indicated and a reconciliation of adjusted operating income of our segments and corporate and other operations to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures.

results for 2015 presented above reflect the following:
individual annuities. segment results for 2015 increased in comparison to 2014, primarily reflecting a favorable comparative impact from changes in the estimated profitability of the business, higher net asset-based fee income and lower interest expense, partially offset by costs for contract cancellations.
retirement. segment results for 2015 decreased in comparison to 2014, reflecting lower net investment spread results, higher general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, and lower fee income, partially offset by more favorable reserve impacts.
asset management. segment results for 2015 decreased in comparison to 2014, primarily reflecting higher asset management fees from growth in assets under management, which were more than offset by higher expenses, and a lower contribution from other related revenues, net of expenses.
individual life. segment results for 2015 increased in comparison to 2014, primarily reflecting favorable comparative impacts from our annual reviews and updates of assumptions and lower integration costs. excluding these impacts, results for 2015 decreased from the prior year, reflecting less favorable mortality experience inclusive of associated reserve updates and amortization, net of reinsurance, and a lower contribution from investment results, partially offset by growth of our universal and term life businesses.
group insurance. segment results for 2015 increased in comparison to 2014, primarily reflecting favorable comparative impacts from our annual reviews and updates of assumptions. excluding these items, results increased from 2014 reflecting more favorable comparative underwriting results and lower expenses, partially offset by a lower contribution from net investment spread results.
international insurance. segment results for 2015 decreased in comparison to 2014, primarily from net unfavorable impacts from foreign currency exchange rates and from our annual reviews and updates of assumptions. excluding these items, segment results increased from the prior year, reflecting net business growth driven by higher sales, a greater contribution from net investment spread results and the absence of certain reserve refinements that occurred in 2014. partially offsetting these impacts were higher expenses and lower income from non-coupon investments.
corporate and other operations. the results for 2015 in comparison to 2014 reflected decreased losses driven by lower operating debt interest expense, net of higher investment income from the transfer of assets related to the restructuring of the former closed block business, partially offset by higher capital debt interest expense, lower pension and employee benefits income and higher levels of corporate expenses.
closed block division. closed block division results for 2015 increased in comparison to closed block business results for 2014 primarily driven by the absence of costs associated with the early redemption in 2014 of senior secured notes, which we referred to as the ihc debt. excluding this impact, results decreased, reflecting a decrease in net realized investment gains, net investment income and net insurance results, partially offset by lower interest expense and a decrease in the policyholder dividend obligation.

results of operations
2015 to 2014 annual comparison. the increase in "income (loss) from continuing operations" reflected the following:
•   $3,136 million higher net pre-tax earnings primarily resulting from the 2014 impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on certain assets and liabilities within our japanese insurance operations (see "-results of operations by segment-international insurance division-impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on earnings-u.s. gaap earnings impact of products denominated in non-local currencies" for additional information);
•   $3,041 million favorable variance, on a pre-tax basis, reflecting our decision to manage a portion of our interest rate risk through our capital protection framework (see "-results of operations by segment-corporate and other-capital protection framework" for additional information);
•   $615 million favorable variance, on a pre-tax basis, reflecting the net impact from changes in the value of our embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with certain variable annuities (see "-results of operations by segments-u.s. retirement solutions and investment management division-individual annuities-variable annuity hedging program results" for additional information); and
•   $558 million favorable variance, on a pre-tax basis, from adjustments to dac and other costs as well as reserves, reflecting updates to the estimated profitability of our businesses, including the impact of our annual review and update of assumptions and other refinements performed in the second quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2014. this excludes the impact associated with the variable annuity hedging program discussed above (see "-results of operations by segment-u.s. retirement solutions and investment management division-individual annuities" for additional information).
partially offsetting these increases in "income (loss) from continuing operations" were the following items:
•   $1,723 million unfavorable impact of higher tax expense reflecting higher pre-tax income in 2015 compared to 2014; and
•   $1,436 million lower net pre-tax realized gains (losses) for pfi excluding the closed block division, and also excluding the impact of the hedging program associated with certain variable annuities discussed above, primarily reflecting changes in the market value of derivatives (see "-realized investment gains (losses)" for additional information).
2014 to 2013 annual comparison. the increase in "income (loss) from continuing operations" reflected the following:
•   $5,443 million higher net pre-tax realized gains (losses) for the former financial services businesses, excluding the impact of the hedging program associated with certain variable annuities discussed below, primarily reflecting changes in the market value of derivatives;
60
•   $4,313 million favorable variance, on a pre-tax basis, reflecting the net impact from changes in the value of our embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with certain variable annuities; and
•   $889 million higher net pre-tax earnings primarily resulting from the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on certain assets and liabilities within our japanese insurance operations.
partially offsetting these increases in "income (loss) from continuing operations" were the following items:
•   $5,765 million unfavorable variance, on a pre-tax basis, reflecting our decision to manage a portion of our interest rate risk through our capital protection framework;
•   $1,529 million unfavorable impact reflecting tax expense in 2014 compared to a tax benefit in 2013, largely driven by pre-tax income in 2014 compared to a loss in 2013; and
•   $1,047 million unfavorable variance, on a pre-tax basis, from adjustments to dac and other costs as well as reserves, reflecting updates to the estimated profitability of our businesses. this excludes the impact associated with the variable annuity hedging program discussed above.
segment measures adjusted operating income. in managing our business, we analyze our segments' operating performance using "adjusted operating income." adjusted operating income does not equate to "income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures" or "net income (loss)" as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("u.s. gaap"), but is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources, and consistent with authoritative guidance, is our measure of segment performance. the adjustments to derive adjusted operating income are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with u.s. gaap, and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies. however, we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our businesses. as discussed in "-executive summary-results of operations" above, under both the current reporting for the closed block division and the former reporting for the closed block business, its results are excluded from adjusted operating income.
see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of adjusted operating income.
annualized new business premiums. in managing certain of our businesses, we analyze annualized new business premiums, which do not correspond to revenues under u.s. gaap. annualized new business premiums measure the current sales performance of the business, while revenues primarily reflect the renewal persistency of policies written in prior years and net investment income, in addition to current sales. annualized new business premiums include 10% of first year premiums or deposits from single pay products. no other adjustments are made for limited pay contracts.
the amount of annualized new business premiums for any given period can be significantly impacted by several factors, including but not limited to: addition of new products, discontinuation of existing products, changes in credited interest rates for certain products and other product modifications, changes in tax laws, changes in regulations or changes in the competitive environment. sales volume may increase or decrease prior to certain of these changes becoming effective, and then fluctuate in the other direction following such changes.
assets under management. in managing our asset management business, we analyze assets under management, which do not correspond to u.s. gaap assets, because the principal source of revenues is fees based on assets under management. assets under management represents the fair market value or account value of assets which we manage directly for institutional clients, retail clients, and for our general account, as well as assets invested in our products that are managed by third-party managers.
account values. in managing our individual annuity and retirement businesses, we analyze account values, which do not correspond to u.s. gaap assets. net sales (redemptions) in our individual annuity business and net additions (withdrawals) in our retirement business do not correspond to revenues under u.s. gaap, but are used as a relevant measure of business activity.
61
accounting policies & pronouncements application of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. management, on an ongoing basis, reviews estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements. if management determines that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate given current facts and circumstances, the company's results of operations and financial position as reported in the consolidated financial statements could change significantly.
the following sections discuss the accounting policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions and require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.
deferred policy acquisition and other costs we capitalize costs that are directly related to the acquisition or renewal of insurance and annuity contracts. these costs primarily include commissions, as well as costs of policy issuance and underwriting and certain other expenses that are directly related to successfully negotiated contracts. we have also deferred costs associated with sales inducements related to our variable and fixed annuity contracts primarily within our individual annuities segment. sales inducements are amounts that are credited to the policyholder's account balance as an inducement to purchase the contract. for additional information about sales inducements, see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. we generally amortize these deferred policy acquisition costs ("dac") and deferred sales inducements ("dsi") over the expected lives of the contracts, based on our estimates of the level and timing of gross margins, gross profits, or gross premiums, depending on the type of contract. as described in more detail below, in calculating dac and dsi amortization, we are required to make assumptions about investment returns, mortality, persistency, and other items that impact our estimates of the level and timing of gross margins, gross profits, or gross premiums. we also periodically evaluate the recoverability of our dac and dsi. for certain contracts, this evaluation is performed as part of our premium deficiency testing, as discussed further below in "-policyholder liabilities." as of december 31, 2015, dac and dsi for pfi excluding the closed block division were $16.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, and dac in our closed block division was $373 million.
amortization methodologies dac associated with the non-participating whole life and term life policies of our individual life segment and the whole life, term life, endowment and health policies of our international insurance segment is amortized in proportion to gross premiums.
dac and dsi associated with the variable and universal life policies of our individual life and international insurance segments and the variable and fixed annuity contracts of our individual annuities and international insurance segments are generally amortized over the expected life of these policies in proportion to total gross profits. total gross profits include both actual gross profits and estimates of gross profits for future periods. in calculating gross profits, we consider mortality, persistency, and other elements as well as rates of return on investments associated with these contracts and the costs related to our guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefits. for variable annuities in our individual annuities segment, u.s. gaap gross profits and amortization rates also include the impacts of the embedded derivatives associated with certain of the living benefit features of our variable annuity contracts and related hedging activities. in calculating amortization expense, we estimate the amounts of gross profits that will be included in our u.s. gaap results and in adjusted operating income, and utilize these estimates to calculate distinct amortization rates and expense amounts. we also regularly evaluate and adjust the related dac and dsi balances with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the impact of actual gross profits and changes in our projections of estimated future gross profits on our dac and dsi amortization rates. adjustments to the dac and dsi balances include the impact to our estimate of total gross profits of the annual review of assumptions, our quarterly adjustments for current period experience, and our quarterly adjustments for market performance. each of these adjustments is further discussed below in "-annual assumptions review and quarterly adjustments." for additional information on our internally-defined hedge target, see "-results of operations by segment-u.s. retirement solutions and investment management division-individual annuities-variable annuity hedging program results."
62
dac associated with the traditional participating products of our closed block is amortized over the expected lives of those contracts in proportion to estimated gross margins. gross margins consider premiums, investment returns, benefit claims, costs for policy administration, changes in reserves, and dividends to policyholders. we evaluate our estimates of future gross margins and adjust the related dac balance with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the effects of actual gross margins and changes in our expected future gross margins. dac adjustments for these participating products generally have not created significant volatility in our results of operations since many of the factors that affect gross margins are also included in the determination of our dividends to these policyholders and, during most years, the closed block has recognized a cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense in "policyholders' dividends," for the excess of actual cumulative earnings over expected cumulative earnings as determined at the time of demutualization. however, if actual cumulative earnings fall below expected cumulative earnings in future periods, thereby eliminating the cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense, changes in gross margins and dac amortization would result in a net impact to the closed block results of operations. as of december 31, 2015, the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was $1,694 million.
the amortization methodologies for products not discussed above primarily relate to less significant dac balances associated with products in our group insurance and retirement segments, which comprised approximately 2% of the company's total dac balance as of december 31, 2015.
annual assumptions review and quarterly adjustments annually, we perform a comprehensive review of the assumptions used in estimating gross profits for future periods. over the last several years, the company's most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future gross profits and the amortization of dac and dsi have been related to lapse experience and other contractholder behavior assumptions, mortality, and revisions to expected future rates of returns on investments. these assumptions may also cause potential significant variability in amortization expense in the future. the impact on our results of operations of changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time.
the quarterly adjustments for current period experience referred to above reflect the impact of differences between actual gross profits for a given period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for that period. to the extent each period's actual experience differs from the previous estimate for that period, the assumed level of total gross profits may change. in these cases, we recognize a cumulative adjustment to all previous periods' amortization, also referred to as an experience true-up adjustment.
the quarterly adjustments for market performance referred to above reflect the impact of changes to our estimate of total gross profits to reflect actual fund performance and market conditions. a significant portion of gross profits for our variable annuity contracts and, to a lesser degree, our variable life policies are dependent upon the total rate of return on assets held in separate account investment options. this rate of return influences the fees we earn, costs we incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts, as well as other sources of profit. returns that are higher than our expectations for a given period produce higher than expected account balances, which increase the future fees we expect to earn and decrease the future costs we expect to incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts. the opposite occurs when returns are lower than our expectations. the changes in future expected gross profits are used to recognize a cumulative adjustment to all prior periods' amortization.
the near-term future equity rate of return assumption used in evaluating dac and other costs for our domestic variable annuity and variable life insurance products is derived using a reversion to the mean approach, a common industry practice. under this approach, we consider historical equity returns and adjust projected equity returns over an initial future period of five years (the "near-term") so that equity returns converge to the long-term expected rate of return. if the near-term projected future rate of return is greater than our near-term maximum future rate of return of 15%, we use our maximum future rate of return. as of december 31, 2015, our variable annuities and variable life insurance businesses assume an 8.0% long-term equity expected rate of return and a 6.0% near-term mean reversion equity rate of return.
the weighted average rate of return assumptions consider many factors specific to each business, including asset durations, asset allocations and other factors. we generally update the near-term equity rates of return and our estimate of total gross profits each quarter to reflect the result of the reversion to the mean approach. we generally update the future interest rates used to project fixed income returns annually and in any quarter when interest rates vary significantly from these assumptions. these market performance related adjustments to our estimate of total gross profits result in cumulative adjustments to prior amortization, reflecting the application of the new required rate of amortization to all prior periods' gross profits.

dac and dsi sensitivities variability in the level of amortization expense has historically been driven by the variable annuities and variable and universal life insurance policies in our individual life and individual annuities segments, for which costs are amortized in proportion to total gross profits. for our international insurance segment, these products have historically experienced less significant variability due to a less material block of variable annuities and variable and universal life insurance policies.
for the variable and universal life policies of our individual life segment, a significant portion of our gross profits is derived from mortality margins. as a result, our estimates of future gross profits are significantly influenced by our mortality assumptions. our mortality assumptions are used to estimate future death claims over the life of these policies and may be developed based on company experience, industry experience and/or other factors. unless a material change in mortality experience that we feel is indicative of a long-term trend is observed in an interim period, we generally update our mortality assumptions annually. updates to our mortality assumptions in future periods could have a significant adverse or favorable effect on the results of our operations in the individual life segment.
the dac balance associated with the variable and universal life policies of our individual life segment as of december 31, 2015 was $3.0 billion. the following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of that dac balance relative to our future mortality assumptions by quantifying the adjustments that would be required, assuming both an increase and decrease in our future mortality rate by 1%. the information below is for illustrative purposes only and considers only the direct effect of changes in our mortality assumptions on the dac balance, with no changes in any other assumptions such as persistency, future rate of return, or expenses included in our evaluation of dac. further, this information does not reflect changes in the unearned revenue reserve, which would partially offset the adjustments to the dac balance reflected below. these reserves are discussed in more detail below in "-policyholder liabilities."

decrease in future mortality by 1%   $38
increase in future mortality by 1%   $(38                  )
in addition to the impact of mortality experience relative to our assumptions, other factors may also drive variability in amortization expense, particularly when our annual assumption updates are performed. as noted above, however, the impact on our results of operations of changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time. in 2015, updates to mortality assumptions drove the most significant changes to amortization expense. for a discussion of dac adjustments related to our individual life segment for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, see "-results of operations by segment-u.s. individual life and group insurance division-individual life."
for the variable annuity contracts of our individual annuities segment, dac and dsi are more sensitive to changes in our future rate of return assumptions due primarily to the significant portion of our gross profits that is dependent upon the total rate of return on assets held in separate account investment options. the dac and dsi balances associated with our domestic variable annuity contracts were $4.9 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, as of december 31, 2015. the following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of each of these balances relative to our future rate of return assumptions by quantifying the adjustments to each balance that would be required assuming both an increase and decrease in our future rate of return by 100 bps. the information below is for illustrative purposes only and considers only the direct effect of changes in our future rate of return on the dac and dsi balances and not changes in any other assumptions such as persistency, mortality, or expenses included in our evaluation of dac and dsi. further, this information does not reflect changes in reserves, such as the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and optional living benefit features of our variable annuity products, or the impact that changes in such reserves may have on the dac and dsi balances.

in addition to the impact of market performance relative to our future rate of return assumptions, other factors may also drive variability in amortization expense, particularly when our annual assumption updates are performed. as noted above, however, the impact on our results of operations of changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time. in 2015, updates to projected interest rate assumptions and mapping of funds to related indices drove the most significant changes to amortization expense. for a discussion of dac and dsi adjustments related to our individual annuities segment for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, see "-results of operations by segment-u.s. retirement solutions and investment management division-individual annuities."
value of business acquired in addition to dac and dsi, we also recognize an asset for value of business acquired ("voba"). voba is an intangible asset which represents an adjustment to the stated value of acquired inforce insurance contract liabilities to present them at fair value, determined as of the acquisition date. voba is amortized over the expected life of the acquired contracts in proportion to either gross premiums or estimated gross profits, depending on the type of contract. voba is also subject to recoverability testing. as of december 31, 2015, voba was $2.8 billion, and included $1.3 billion related to the acquisition from aig of the star and edison businesses on february 1, 2011, and $1.3 billion related to the acquisition of the hartford financial services group's individual life insurance business ("the hartford life business") on january 2, 2013. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these acquisitions. the remaining $0.2 billion primarily relates to previously-acquired traditional life, deferred annuity, defined contribution and defined benefit businesses.
the voba associated with the hartford life business is primarily amortized over the expected life of the acquired contracts in proportion to estimates of gross profits. a significant portion of our gross profits is derived from mortality margins. as a result, our estimates of future gross profits are significantly influenced by our mortality assumptions. our mortality assumptions are used to estimate future death claims over the life of these policies and may be developed based on company experience, industry experience and/or other factors. unless a material change in mortality experience that we feel is indicative of a long-term trend is observed in an interim period, we generally update our mortality assumptions annually. updates to our mortality assumptions in future periods could have a significant adverse or favorable effect on the results of our operations in the individual life segment. the following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of that voba balance relative to our future mortality assumptions by quantifying the adjustments that would be required, assuming both an increase and decrease in our future mortality rate by 1%. the information below is for illustrative purposes only and considers only the direct effect of changes in our mortality assumptions on the voba balance, with no changes in any other assumptions such as persistency, future rate of return, or expenses included in our evaluation of voba, and does not reflect changes in reserves.

in addition to the impact of mortality experience relative to our assumptions, other factors may also drive variability in amortization expense, particularly when our annual assumption updates are performed. as noted above, however, the impact on our results of operations of changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time. in 2015, updates to investment-related assumptions drove the most significant changes to amortization expense. for a discussion of the drivers of results related to our individual life segment for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, see "-results of operations by segment-u.s. individual life and group insurance division-individual life."
the voba associated with the inforce contracts acquired from aig of the star and edison businesses is less sensitive to assumption changes, as the majority is amortized in proportion to premiums rather than gross profits. for additional information about voba including details on items included in our estimates of future cash flows for the various acquired businesses and its bases for amortization, see note 2 and note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
goodwill as of december 31, 2015, our goodwill balance of $824 million is reflected in the following four reporting units: $444 million related to our retirement full service business, $231 million related to our asset management business, $139 million related to our gibraltar life and other operations and $10 million related to our international insurance life planner business.
65
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, as of december 31 of each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the potential for impairment is more likely than not. the goodwill impairment analysis is performed at the reporting unit level which is equal to or one level below our operating segments. this analysis includes a qualitative assessment, for which reporting units may elect to bypass in accordance with accounting guidance, and a quantitative analysis consisting of two steps. for additional information on goodwill and the process for testing goodwill for impairment, see note 2 and note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
in the international insurance's life planner business and the asset management segment, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and complete the impairment analysis using an earnings multiple approach. the earnings multiple approach indicates the value of a business based on comparison to publicly-traded comparable companies in similar lines of business. each comparable company is analyzed based on various factors, including, but not limited to, financial risk, size, geographic diversification, profitability, adequate financial data, and an actively traded stock price. a multiple of price to earnings is developed for the comparable companies using independent analysts' consensus estimates for each company's 2015 forecasted earnings. the multiples are then aggregated and a mean and median multiple is calculated for the group. the lower of the mean or median multiple is then applied to the 2015 forecasted earnings of the reporting unit to develop a value. a control premium is then added to determine a total estimated fair value for the reporting unit.
in the retirement full service business and gibraltar life and other operations, we also elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and complete the impairment analysis using a discounted cash flow approach. the discounted cash flow approach calculates the value of a business by applying a discount rate reflecting the market expected rate of return of the reporting unit to its projected future cash flows. these projected future cash flows were based on our internal forecasts, an expected growth rate and a terminal value. the reporting unit expected rate of return represents the required rate of return on its total capitalization. the process of deriving reporting unit specific required rates of return begins with the calculation of an overall company weighted average cost of capital, which includes the calculation of the required return on equity using a capital asset pricing model ("capm"). the capm is a generally accepted method for estimating an equity investor's return requirement, and hence a company's cost of equity capital. the calculation using the capm begins with the long-term risk-free rate of return, then applies a market risk premium for large company common stock, as well as company specific adjustments to address volatility versus the market. the company then determines reporting unit specific required rates of return based on their relative volatilities, benchmarks results against reporting unit comparable companies, and ensures that the sum of the reporting unit required returns (after considering the impact of unallocated corporate costs and capital) add up to the overall company required return. this process results in reporting unit specific discount rates which are then applied to the expected future cash flows of the retirement full service business and gibraltar life and other operations to estimate their respective fair values.
after completion of step 1 of the quantitative tests, the fair values exceeded the carrying amounts for each of the four reporting units and we concluded there was no impairment as of december 31, 2015. the asset management, international insurance's life planner, gibraltar life and other operations, and retirement full service businesses had estimated fair values that exceeded their carrying amounts, each by more than 60%.
estimating the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process that involves the use of significant estimates by management. regarding all reporting units tested, market declines or other events impacting the fair value of these businesses, including discount rates, interest rates and growth rate assumptions or increases in the level of equity required to support these businesses, could result in goodwill impairments, resulting in a charge to income.
valuation of investments, including derivatives, and the recognition of other-than-temporary impairments our investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans, equity securities, other invested assets, and derivative financial instruments. derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices or the values of securities or commodities. derivative financial instruments we generally use include swaps, futures, forwards and options and may be exchange-traded or contracted in the over-the-counter ("otc") market. we are also party to financial instruments that contain derivative instruments that are "embedded" in the financial instruments. management believes the following accounting policies related to investments, including derivatives, are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. each of these policies is discussed further within other relevant disclosures related to the investments and derivatives, as referenced below:
•   valuation of investments, including derivatives;
•   recognition of other-than-temporary impairments ("otti"); and
•   determination of the valuation allowance for losses on commercial mortgage and other loans.
66
we present at fair value in the statements of financial position our investments classified as available-for-sale (including fixed maturity and equity securities), investments classified as trading such as our trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities, derivatives and embedded derivatives. for additional information regarding the key estimates and assumptions surrounding the determination of fair value of fixed maturity and equity securities, as well as derivative instruments, embedded derivatives and other investments, see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements and "-valuation of assets and liabilities-fair value of assets and liabilities."
for our investments classified as available-for-sale, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("aoci"), a separate component of equity. for our investments classified as trading, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded within "other income." in addition, investments classified as available-for-sale, as well as those classified as held-to-maturity, are subject to impairment reviews to identify when a decline in value is other-than-temporary. for a discussion of our policies regarding other-than-temporary declines in investment value and the related methodology for recording other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturity and equity securities, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
commercial mortgage and other loans are carried primarily at unpaid principal balances, net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and expenses and unamortized premiums or discounts and a valuation allowance for losses. for a discussion of our policies regarding the valuation allowance for commercial mortgage and other loans, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
policyholder liabilities future policy benefit reserves, including unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses we establish reserves for future policy benefits to, or on behalf of, policyholders in the same period in which the policy is issued or acquired, using methodologies prescribed by u.s. gaap. the reserving methodologies used include the following:
•   for most long-duration contracts, we utilize best estimate assumptions as of the date the policy is issued or acquired with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation, as appropriate. after the liabilities are initially established, we perform premium deficiency tests using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date without provisions for adverse deviation. if the liabilities determined based on these best estimate assumptions are greater than the net reserves (i.e., gaap reserves net of any dac, dsi or voba asset), the existing net reserves are adjusted by first reducing these assets by the amount of the deficiency or to zero through a charge to current period earnings. if the deficiency is more than these asset balances for insurance contracts, we then increase the net reserves by the excess, again through a charge to current period earnings. if a premium deficiency is recognized, the assumptions as of the premium deficiency test date are locked in and used in subsequent valuations.
•   for certain reserves, such as our contracts with guaranteed minimum death benefits ("gmdb"), guaranteed minimum income benefits ("gmib") and no-lapse guarantees, we utilize current best estimate assumptions in establishing reserves. the reserves are subject to adjustments based on annual reviews of assumptions and quarterly adjustments for experience, including market performance, and the reserves may be adjusted through a benefit or charge to current period earnings.
•   for certain product guarantees, primarily certain living benefit features of the variable annuity products in our individual annuities segment, the benefits are accounted for as embedded derivatives, with fair values calculated as the present value of expected future benefit payments to contractholders less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature. under u.s. gaap, the fair values of these benefit features are based on assumptions a market participant would use in valuing these embedded derivatives. changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives are recorded quarterly through a benefit or charge to current period earnings.
the assumptions used in establishing reserves are generally based on the company's experience, industry experience and/or other factors, as applicable. we typically update our actuarial assumptions, such as mortality, morbidity, retirement and policyholder behavior assumptions, annually, unless a material change is observed in an interim period that we feel is indicative of a long-term trend. generally, we do not expect trends to change significantly in the short-term and, to the extent these trends may change, we expect such changes to be gradual over the long-term. in a sustained low interest rate environment, there is an increased likelihood that the reserves determined based on best estimate assumptions may be greater than the net liabilities.
the following paragraphs provide additional details about the reserves established by each of our segments.
67
the future policy benefit reserves for our international insurance segment, which as of december 31, 2015, represented 41% of our total future policy benefit reserves, primarily relate to non-participating whole life and term life products and endowment contracts, and are generally determined as the present value of expected future benefits to, or on behalf of, policyholders plus the present value of future maintenance expenses less the present value of future net premiums. for these reserves, we utilize best estimate assumptions as of the date the policy is issued or acquired with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation, as described above. the primary assumptions used in determining expected future benefits and expenses include mortality, lapse, morbidity, investment yield and maintenance expense assumptions. in addition, future policy benefit reserves for certain contracts also include amounts related to our deferred profit liability.
the reserves for future policy benefits of our retirement segment, which as of december 31, 2015 represented 24% of our total future policy benefit reserves, primarily relate to our non-participating life contingent group annuity and structured settlement products. these reserves are generally determined as the present value of expected future benefits and expenses. for these reserves, we utilize best estimate assumptions as of the date the policy is issued or acquired with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation, as described above. for contracts that have recorded a premium deficiency reserve, we use assumptions as of the most recent premium deficiency reserve establishment. the primary assumptions used in establishing these reserves include mortality, retirement, maintenance expense, and interest rate assumptions. in addition, future policy benefit reserves for certain contracts also include amounts related to our deferred profit liability.
the reserves for future policy benefits of our individual annuities segment, which as of december 31, 2015 represented 5% of our total future policy benefit reserves, primarily relate to reserves for the gmdb and gmib features of our variable annuities, and for the optional living benefit features that are accounted for as embedded derivatives. as discussed above, in establishing reserves for gmdbs and gmibs, we utilize current best estimate assumptions. the primary assumptions used in establishing these reserves include annuitization, lapse, withdrawal and mortality assumptions, as well as interest rate and equity market return assumptions. lapse rates are adjusted at the contract level based on the in-the-moneyness of the living benefit and reflect other factors, such as the applicability of any surrender charges. lapse rates are reduced when contracts are more in-the-money. lapse rates are also generally assumed to be lower for the period where surrender charges apply.
the reserves for certain living benefit features, including guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits ("gmab"), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits ("gmwb") and guaranteed minimum income and withdrawal benefits ("gmiwb"), are accounted for as embedded derivatives, with fair values calculated as the present value of expected future benefit payments to contractholders less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature. this methodology could result in either a liability or contra-liability balance, given changing capital market conditions and various actuarial assumptions. since there is no observable active market for the transfer of these obligations, the valuations are calculated using internally-developed models with option pricing techniques. the models are based on a risk neutral valuation framework and incorporate premiums for risks inherent in valuation techniques, inputs, and the general uncertainty around the timing and amount of future cash flows. the significant inputs to the valuation models for these embedded derivatives include capital market assumptions, such as interest rate levels and volatility assumptions, the company's market-perceived risk of its own non-performance ("npr"), as well as actuarially determined assumptions, including contractholder behavior, such as lapse rates, benefit utilization rates, withdrawal rates, and mortality rates. capital market inputs and actual contractholders' account values are updated each quarter based on capital market conditions as of the end of the quarter, including interest rates, equity markets and volatility. in the risk neutral valuation, the initial swap curve drives the total returns used to grow the contractholders' account values. the company's discount rate assumption is based on the london inter-bank offered rate ("libor") swap curve adjusted for an additional spread relative to libor to reflect npr. actuarial assumptions, including contractholder behavior and mortality, are reviewed at least annually, and updated based upon emerging experience, future expectations and other data, including any observable market data, such as available industry studies or market transactions such as acquisitions and reinsurance transactions. for additional information regarding the valuation of these optional living benefit features, see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
the future policy benefit reserves for our individual life segment, which as of december 31, 2015, represented 4% of our total future policy benefit reserves, primarily relate to term life, universal life and variable life products. for term life contracts, the future policy benefit reserves are determined as the present value of expected future benefits to, or on behalf of, policyholders plus the present value of future maintenance expenses less the present value of future net premiums. for these reserves, we utilize best estimate assumptions as of the date the policy is issued or acquired with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation, as described above. the primary assumptions used in determining expected future benefits and expenses include mortality, lapse, and maintenance expense assumptions. for variable and universal life products, which include universal life contracts that contain no-lapse guarantees, reserves are established using current best estimate assumptions, as described above.
68
the reserves for future policy benefits of our group insurance segment, which as of december 31, 2015 represented 2% of our total future policy benefit reserves, primarily relate to reserves for group life and disability benefits. for short-duration contracts, a liability is established when the loss occurs. the reserves for group life and disability benefits include our liability of $2.8 billion for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses for our group insurance segment as of december 31, 2015, which relates primarily to the group long-term disability product. this liability represents our estimate of future disability claim payments and expenses as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred, but have not yet been reported, as of the balance sheet date. the liability is determined as the present value of expected future claim payments and expenses. the primary assumptions used in determining expected future claim payments are claim termination factors, an assumed interest rate and expected social security offsets. long-term disability claims and claim termination experience may be affected by the economic environment and internal factors such as our claims management process. the remaining reserves for future policy benefits for group life and disability benefits relate primarily to our group life business, and include reserves for waiver of premium, claims in course of settlement ("icos") and claims incurred but not reported ("ibnr"). the waiver of premium reserve is calculated as the present value of future benefits, and utilizes assumptions such as expected mortality and recovery rates. the icos reserve is based on the inventory of claims that have been reported but not yet paid. the ibnr reserve is estimated using expected patterns of claims reporting.
the reserves for future policy benefits of our corporate & other operations, which as of december 31, 2015 represented 2% of our total future policy benefit reserves, primarily relate to our long-term care products. these reserves are generally determined as the present value of expected future benefits and expenses less future premiums. most contracts have recorded a premium deficiency reserve, for which we use assumptions as of the most recent premium deficiency reserve establishment. the primary assumptions used in establishing these reserves include interest rate, morbidity, mortality, lapse, premium rate increase and maintenance expense assumptions. in addition, certain less significant reserves for our long-term care products, such as our disabled life reserves, are established using current best estimate actuarial assumptions, as described above.
the future policy benefit reserves for the traditional participating life insurance products of the closed block division, which as of december 31, 2015, represented 22% of our total future policy benefit reserves are determined using the net level premium method. under this method, the future policy benefit reserves are accrued as a level proportion of the premium paid by the policyholder. in applying this method, we use mortality assumptions to determine our expected future benefits and expected future premiums, and apply an interest rate to determine the present value of both the expected future benefit payments and the expected future premiums. the mortality assumptions are based on standard industry mortality tables that were used to determine the cash surrender value of the policies, and the interest rates used are the interest rates used to calculate the cash surrender value of the policies.
sensitivity for future policy benefit reserves we expect the future benefit reserves in our individual annuities segment that are based on current best estimate assumptions, and those that represent embedded derivatives recorded at fair value to be the ones most likely to drive variability in earnings from period to period.
for the gmdb and gmib features of our variable annuities in our individual annuities segment, the reserves for these contracts are significantly influenced by the future rate of return assumptions. the following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of the reserves for gmdbs and gmibs related to variable annuity contracts relative to our future rate of return assumptions by quantifying the adjustments to these reserves that would be required assuming both a 100 basis point increase and decrease in our future rate of return. the information below is for illustrative purposes only and considers only the direct effect of changes in our future rate of return on operating results due to the change in the reserve balance and not changes in any other assumptions such as persistency or mortality included in our evaluation of the reserves, or any changes on dac or other balances, discussed above in "-deferred policy acquisition and other costs."

69
in addition to the impact of market performance relative to our future rate of return assumptions, other factors may also drive variability in the change in reserves, particularly when our annual assumption updates are performed. as noted above, however, the impact on our results of operations of changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time. in 2015, updates to utilization rate assumptions, partially offset by updates to projected interest rate assumptions, drove the most significant changes to these reserves. for a discussion of adjustments to the reserves for gmdbs and gmibs for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, see "-results of operations by segment-u.s. retirement solutions and investment management division-individual annuities."
for certain living benefit features of the variable annuities in our individual annuities segment that are accounted for as embedded derivatives, the changes in reserves are significantly impacted by changes in both the capital markets assumptions and actuarial assumptions. capital market inputs and actual policyholders' account values are updated each quarter based on capital market conditions as of the end of the quarter, while actuarial assumptions are reviewed at least annually, and updated based upon emerging experience, future expectations and other data. for additional information about the impacts of capital markets assumptions, including interest rates, npr credit spreads and equity returns, refer to "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" below. in 2015, updates to mapping of funds to related indices, partially offset by updates to mortality rate assumptions drove the most significant changes to these reserves. other factors may also drive variability in the change in reserves, particularly when our annual assumption updates are performed. as noted above, however, the impact on our results of operations of changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time. for a discussion of the drivers of the changes in our optional living benefit features for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, see "-results of operations by segment-u.s. retirement solutions and investment management division-individual annuities."
unearned revenue reserve our unearned revenue reserve ("urr"), reported as a component of "policyholders' account balances," is $2.2 billion as of december 31, 2015. this reserve primarily relates to variable and universal life products within our individual life segment and represents policy charges for services to be provided in future periods. the charges are deferred as unearned revenue and are generally amortized over the expected life of the contract in proportion to the product's estimated gross profits, similar to dac as discussed above.
for the variable and universal life policies of our individual life segment, a significant portion of our gross profits is derived from mortality margins. as a result, our estimates of future gross profits are significantly influenced by our mortality assumptions. our mortality assumptions are used to estimate future death claims over the life of these policies and are developed based on company experience, industry experience and/or other factors. unless a material change in mortality experience that we feel is indicative of a long-term trend is observed in an interim period, we generally update our mortality assumptions annually. updates to our mortality assumptions in future periods could have a significant adverse or favorable effect on the results of our operations in the individual life segment.
the urr balance associated with the variable and universal life policies of our individual life segment as of december 31, 2015 was $1.9 billion. the following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of that urr balance relative to our future mortality assumptions by quantifying the adjustments that would be required, assuming both an increase and decrease in our future mortality rate by 1%. the information below is for illustrative purposes only and considers only the direct effect of changes in our mortality assumptions on the urr balance and not changes in any other assumptions such as persistency, future rate of return, or expenses included in our evaluation of urr. it does not reflect changes in assets, such as dac, which would partially offset the adjustments to the urr balance reflected below. the impact of dac is discussed in more detail above in "-deferred policy acquisition and other costs."

in addition to the impact of mortality experience relative to our assumptions, other factors may also drive variability in the change in reserves, particularly when our annual assumption updates are performed. as noted above, however, the impact on our results of operations of changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time. in 2015, updates to mortality assumptions drove the most significant changes to our urr reserve. for a discussion of the drivers of urr adjustments related to our individual life segment for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, see "-results of operations by segment-u.s. individual life and group insurance division-individual life."

pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering employees who meet specific eligibility requirements. our net periodic costs for these plans consider an assumed discount (interest) rate, an expected rate of return on plan assets, expected increases in compensation levels, mortality and trends in health care costs. of these assumptions, our expected rate of return assumptions and our discount rate assumptions have historically had the most significant effect on our net period costs associated with these plans.
we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets based upon a building block approach that considers inflation, real return, term premium, credit spreads, equity risk premium and capital appreciation as well as expenses, expected asset manager performance and the effect of rebalancing for the equity, debt and real estate asset mix applied on a weighted average basis to our pension asset portfolio. see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for our actual asset allocations by asset category and the asset allocation ranges prescribed by our investment policy guidelines for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. our assumed long-term rate of return for 2015 was 6.25% for our domestic pension plans and 7.00% for our other postretirement benefit plans. given the amount of plan assets as of december 31, 2014, the beginning of the measurement year, if we had assumed an expected rate of return for both our domestic pension and other domestic postretirement benefit plans that was 100 bps higher or 100 bps lower than the rates we assumed, the change in our net periodic costs would have been as shown in the table below. the information provided in the table below considers only changes in our assumed long-term rate of return given the level and mix of invested assets at the beginning of the measurement year, without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed long-term rate of return.

foreign pension plans represent 5% of plan assets at the beginning of 2015. an increase in expected rate of return by 100 bps would result in a decrease in net periodic pension costs of $6 million; conversely, a decrease in expected rate of return by 100 bps would result in an increase in net periodic pension costs of $6 million.
we determine our discount rate, used to value the pension and postretirement benefit obligations, based upon rates commensurate with current yields on high quality corporate bonds. see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the december 31, 2014 methodology we employed to determine our discount rate for 2015. our assumed discount rate for 2015 was 4.10% for our domestic pension plans and 3.95% for our other domestic postretirement benefit plans. given the amount of pension and postretirement obligations as of december 31, 2014, the beginning of the measurement year, if we had assumed a discount rate for both our domestic pension and other postretirement benefit plans that was 100 bps higher or 100 bps lower than the rates we assumed, the change in our net periodic costs would have been as shown in the table below. the information provided in the table below considers only changes in our assumed discount rate without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed discount rate.

foreign pension plans represent 13% of plan obligations at the beginning of 2015. an increase in discount rate by 100 bps would result in a decrease in net periodic pension costs of $1 million; conversely, a decrease in discount rate by 100 bps would result in an increase in net periodic pension costs of $4 million.

given the application of the authoritative guidance for accounting for pensions, and the deferral and amortization of actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in our assumed discount rate, the change in net periodic pension cost arising from an increase in the assumed discount rate by 100 bps would not be expected to equal the change in net periodic pension cost arising from a decrease in the assumed discount rate by 100 bps.
for a discussion of our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate for our qualified pension plan in 2015, see "-results of operations by segment-corporate and other."
for purposes of calculating pension income from our own qualified pension plan for the year ended december 31, 2016, we will increase the discount rate to 4.50% from 4.10% in 2015. the expected rate of return on plan assets will remain unchanged at 6.25%, and the assumed rate of increase in compensation will remain unchanged at 4.5%.
in addition to the effect of changes in our assumptions, the net periodic cost or benefit from our pension and other postretirement benefit plans may change due to factors such as actual experience being different from our assumptions, special benefits to terminated employees, or changes in benefits provided under the plans.
at december 31, 2015, the sensitivity of our domestic and foreign pension and postretirement obligations to a 100 basis point change in discount rate was as follows:

taxes on income our effective tax rate is based on income, non-taxable and non-deductible items, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. the dividend received deduction ("drd") is a major reason for the difference between the company's effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 35%. the drd estimate incorporates the prior year results as well as the current year's equity market performance. both the current estimate of the drd and the drd in future periods can vary based on factors such as, but not limited to, changes in the amount of dividends received that are eligible for the drd, changes in the amount of distributions received from underlying fund investments, changes in the account balances of variable life and annuity contracts, and the company's taxable income before the drd.
the company provides for u.s. income taxes on its unremitted foreign earnings of its insurance operations in brazil, a portion of its unremitted foreign earnings of its insurance operations in japan and korea, and the unremitted foreign earnings of certain operations in germany and taiwan. unremitted foreign earnings from operations in other foreign jurisdictions are considered to be permanently reinvested.
an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by one percent of income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures, would have resulted in an increase or decrease in our consolidated income from continuing operations before equity in earnings of operating joint ventures in 2015 of $78 million.
the company's liability for income taxes includes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and interest that relate to tax years still subject to review by the internal revenue service ("irs") or other taxing authorities. see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact in 2015, 2014 and 2013 of changes to our total unrecognized tax benefits. we do not anticipate any significant changes within the next twelve months to our total unrecognized tax benefits related to tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired.
the company's affiliates in japan and korea file separate tax returns and are subject to audits by the local taxing authority. the general statute of limitations for japan and korea are five years from when the return is filed.
72
contingencies a contingency is an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved upon the occurrence of future events. under u.s. gaap, accruals for contingencies are required to be established when the future event is probable and its impact can be reasonably estimated, such as in connection with an unresolved legal matter. the initial reserve reflects management's best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and, ultimately, when the matter is brought to closure.
adoption of new accounting pronouncements there were no new accounting pronouncements adopted during 2015 requiring the application of critical accounting estimates. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of newly issued accounting pronouncements.
results of operations by segment u.s. retirement solutions and investment management division individual annuities the individual annuities segment offers both variable and fixed annuities that may include guaranteed living or death benefits. it also offers fixed annuities that provide a guarantee of principal and interest credited at rates we determine, subject to certain contractual minimums. we derive our revenue mainly from fee income generated on variable annuity account values, as the investment return on the contractholder funds is generally attributed directly to the contractholder. we also earn investment income on fixed annuity account values and certain other management fees. our expenses primarily consist of interest credited and other benefits to contractholders, amortization of dac and other costs, non-deferred expenses related to the selling and servicing of the various products we offer, costs of hedging certain risks associated with these products, changes in the reserves for benefit guarantees and other general business expenses. these drivers of our business results are generally included in adjusted operating income, with exceptions related to certain guarantees, as discussed below.
the u.s. gaap accounting and our adjusted operating income treatment for our guarantees differ depending upon the specific feature. the reserves for our gmdb and gmib features are calculated based on our best estimate of actuarial and capital markets return assumptions. the risks associated with these benefit features are retained and results are included in adjusted operating income. in contrast, certain of our guaranteed living benefit features are accounted for as embedded derivatives and reported at fair value. under u.s. gaap, the fair values of these benefit features are based on assumptions a market participant would use in valuing these embedded derivatives. we hedge or limit our exposure to certain risks associated with these features through our living benefits hedging program and product design features. adjusted operating income, as discussed below in "-adjusted operating income" and "-revenues, benefits and expenses," excludes amounts related to changes in the market value of the embedded derivatives and related hedge positions, and the related impact to amortization of dac and other costs. the items excluded from adjusted operating income are discussed below in "-variable annuity hedging program results."
account values account values are a significant driver of our operating results. since most fees are determined by the level of separate account assets, fee income varies according to the level of account values. additionally, our fee income generally drives other items such as our pattern of amortization of dac and other costs. account values are driven by net flows from new business sales, surrenders, withdrawals and benefit payments, the impact of market value changes, which can be either positive or negative, and policy charges. the annuity industry competitive landscape, which has been dynamic over the last few years, may impact our net flows, including new business sales. the following table sets forth account value information for the periods indicated.

__________
(1)   includes variable and fixed annuities sold as retail investment products. investments sold through defined contribution plan products are included with such products within the retirement segment. variable annuity account values were $149.4 billion, $155.1 billion and $150.4 billion as of december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. fixed annuity account values were $3.5 billion, $3.6 billion and $3.7 billion as of december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
2015 to 2014 annual comparison. the decrease in account values during 2015 was largely driven by policy charges on contractholder accounts, benefit payments and unfavorable changes in the market value of contractholder funds. these negative impacts were partially offset by positive net sales. the decline in net sales for 2015 compared to 2014 was largely driven by decreased sales of our prudential premier® retirement variable annuity with "highest daily" benefit riders from actions we have taken in response to capital markets conditions. this was partially offset by an increase in sales of our prudential premier® investment variable annuity ("ppi") and prudential defined income variable annuity ("pdi") products, as a result of our product diversification strategy.
2014 to 2013 annual comparison. the increase in account values during 2014 was largely driven by changes in the market value of contractholder funds, partially offset by policy charges on contractholder accounts and benefit payments. positive net sales also contributed to account value growth, but to a lesser extent, as results for 2014 compared to 2013 reflected a decline in sales coupled with an increase in surrenders and withdrawals. the decline in net sales reflected a decline in sales of our products with the highest daily benefit, partially offset by higher sales of our pdi product, and higher surrenders and withdrawals.

adjusted operating income
2015 to 2014 annual comparison. adjusted operating income increased $330 million. excluding the impacts of changes in the estimated profitability of the business, discussed below, adjusted operating income increased $39 million. the increase was driven by higher asset-based fee income due to growth in average variable annuity account values, net of a related increase in asset-based commissions, a decline in interest expense driven by lower debt, and a decline in amortization costs. partially offsetting this net increase were costs for contract cancellations in connection with remediation of an error in an illustration contained in certain product marketing materials, higher operating expenses and a decline in net investment income driven by lower income on non-coupon investments.
the impacts of changes in the estimated profitability of the business include adjustments to the amortization of dac and other costs and to the reserves for the gmdb and gmib features of our variable annuity products. these adjustments resulted in a net benefit of $162 million and a net charge of $129 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. the $162 million net benefit in 2015 primarily reflected the net impact of equity market performance on contractholder accounts relative to our assumptions, as well as a net benefit resulting from our annual review and update of assumptions. the $129 million net charge in 2014 primarily reflected the impact of lower expected rates of return on fixed income investments within contractholder accounts and on future expected claims relative to our assumptions, which more than offset a net favorable impact from equity market performance. partially offsetting this net charge was a net benefit resulting from the annual review and update of assumptions performed in that year.
2014 to 2013 annual comparison. adjusted operating income decreased $618 million. excluding the impacts of changes in the estimated profitability of the business, discussed below, adjusted operating income increased $207 million. the increase was driven by higher asset-based fee income due to growth in average variable annuity account values, net of a related increase in asset-based commissions. also contributing to the increase were lower amortization costs and reserve provisions for the gmdb and gmib features of our variable annuity products.
adjustments to the amortization of dac and other costs and to the reserves for the gmdb and gmib features of our variable annuity products resulted in a net charge of $129 million and a net benefit of $696 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the $129 million net charge in 2014 primarily reflected the impact of lower expected rates of return on fixed income investments within contractholder accounts and on future expected claims relative to our assumptions, which more than offset a net favorable impact from equity market performance. partially offsetting this net charge was a net benefit resulting from the annual review and update of assumptions performed in that year. the $696 million net benefit in 2013 included a $301 million net benefit resulting from the annual review and update of assumptions and other refinements performed in that year. the remaining net benefit reflected the impact of positive market performance on contractholder accounts relative to our assumptions.
revenues, benefits and expenses
2015 to 2014 annual comparison. revenues, as shown in the table above under "-operating results," decreased $15 million, primarily driven by a $27 million decrease in net investment income due to lower income on non-coupon investments, partially offset by a $19 million increase in policy charges and fee income due to growth in average variable annuity account values.
benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under "-operating results," decreased $345 million. absent the $291 million net decrease related to the impacts of certain changes in our estimated profitability of the business discussed above, benefits and expenses decreased $54 million. interest expense decreased $38 million driven by lower debt, and interest credited to policyholders' account balances decreased $26 million driven by lower average account values in the general account. partially offsetting these decreases was a $14 million increase in policyholders' benefits driven by costs for contract cancellations, as discussed above.
2014 to 2013 annual comparison. revenues increased $245 million, primarily driven by a $311 million increase in policy charges and fee income, asset management and service fees and other income, due to growth in average variable annuity account values. partially offsetting this increase was a $63 million decline in net investment income, driven by lower reinvestment rates and lower average account values in the general account due to surrenders of legacy general account products.
75
benefits and expenses increased $863 million. absent the $825 million net increase related to the impacts of certain changes in our estimated profitability of the business discussed above, benefits and expenses increased $38 million. general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, increased $111 million, driven by higher asset-based commissions and asset management costs due to account value growth. interest expense increased $16 million, driven by issuance of longer duration debt, partially offset by repayments of debt. partially offsetting these increases was a $45 million decrease in interest credited to policyholders' account balances driven by lower average account values in the general account. amortization of dac decreased $22 million primarily due to lower amortization rates, and policyholders' benefits decreased $22 million primarily due to changes in reserves.
variable annuity risks and risk mitigants the primary risk exposures of our variable annuity contracts relate to actual deviations from, or changes to, the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products, including capital markets assumptions such as equity market returns, interest rates and market volatility, along with actuarial assumptions such as contractholder mortality, the timing and amount of annuitization and withdrawals, and contract lapses. for our actuarial assumptions, we have retained the majority of the risk that actual experience will differ from the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products. for our capital markets assumptions, we hedge or limit our exposure to certain risks created by capital markets fluctuations through a combination of product design features, such as an automatic rebalancing feature, also referred to as an asset transfer feature, and inclusion of certain living benefits in our hedging program. in addition, we consider external reinsurance a form of risk mitigation. effective april 1, 2015, we entered into an agreement with union hamilton reinsurance, ltd. ("union hamilton"), an external counterparty, to reinsure approximately 50% of the highest daily lifetime income ("hdi") v.3.0 business. hdi v.3.0 is the newest version of our "highest daily" living benefits guarantee that is available with our prudential premier® retirement variable annuity. this reinsurance agreement covers most new hdi v.3.0 variable annuity business issued between april 1, 2015 and december 31, 2016 on a quota share basis, until union hamilton's quota share reaches $5 billion of new rider premiums through december 31, 2016.
our automatic rebalancing feature occurs at the contract level, and transfers assets between certain variable investment sub-accounts selected by the annuity contractholder and, depending on the benefit feature, a fixed-rate account in the general account or a bond fund sub-account within the separate accounts. the automatic rebalancing feature associated with currently-sold highest daily benefit products uses a designated bond fund sub-account within the separate accounts. the transfers are based on a static mathematical formula used with the particular benefit which considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the impact of investment performance on the contractholder's total account value. the objective of the automatic rebalancing feature is to reduce our exposure to equity market risk and market volatility. other product design features we utilize include, among others, asset allocation restrictions, minimum issuance age requirements and certain limitations on the amount of contractholder deposits, as well as a required allocation to our general account for certain of our products. we have also introduced new products that diversify our risk profile and incorporate provisions in product design allowing frequent revisions of key pricing elements. in addition, certain fees are primarily based on the benefit guarantee amount, the contractholder account value and/or premiums, which helps preserve certain revenue streams when market fluctuations cause account values to decline.
we use our hedging program to help manage certain risks associated with certain of our guarantees. the hedging program's objective is to help mitigate fluctuations in net income and capital from living benefit liabilities due to capital market movements, within established tolerances. through our hedging program, we enter into derivative positions that seek to offset the net change in our hedge target, discussed further below. in addition to mitigating fluctuations of the living benefit liabilities due to capital market movements, the hedging program is also focused on a long-term goal of accumulating assets that could be used to pay claims under these benefits irrespective of market path. for additional information regarding this program, see "-variable annuities hedging program results" below.
for certain living benefits features, claims will primarily represent the funding of contractholder lifetime withdrawals after the cumulative withdrawals have first exhausted the contractholder account value. due to the age of the in force block, limited claim payments have occurred to date, and they are not expected to increase significantly within the next five years, based upon current assumptions. the timing and amount of future claims will depend on actual returns on contractholder account value and actual contractholder behavior relative to our assumptions. the majority of our current living benefits features provide for guaranteed lifetime contractholder withdrawal payments inclusive of a "highest daily" contract value guarantee. our pdi variable annuity complements our variable annuity products with the highest daily benefit and provides for guaranteed lifetime contractholder withdrawal payments, but restricts contractholder asset allocation to a single bond fund sub-account within the separate account.
76
the majority of our variable annuity contracts with living benefits features, and all new contracts sold with our highest daily living benefits feature, include risk mitigants in the form of an automatic rebalancing feature and/or inclusion in our hedging program. as discussed above, we also utilize external reinsurance as a form of additional risk mitigation. the guaranteed benefits of certain legacy products that were sold prior to our implementation of the automatic rebalancing feature are also included in our hedging program. certain legacy gmab products include the automatic rebalancing feature, but are not included in the hedging program. the pdi product and contracts with the gmib feature have neither risk mitigant. rather than utilizing a capital markets hedging strategy, certain risks associated with pdi are managed through the limitation of contractholder asset allocations to a single bond fund sub-account.
for our gmdbs, we provide a benefit payable in the event of death. our base gmdb is generally equal to a return of cumulative deposits adjusted for any partial withdrawals. certain products include an optional enhanced gmdb based on the greater of a minimum return on the contract value or an enhanced value. we have retained the risk that the total amount of death benefit payable may be greater than the contractholder account value. however, a substantial portion of the account values associated with gmdbs are subject to an automatic rebalancing feature because the contractholder also selected a living benefit feature which includes an automatic rebalancing feature. all of the variable annuity account values with living benefit features also contain gmdbs. the living and death benefit features for these contracts cover the same insured life and, consequently, we have insured both the longevity and mortality risk on these contracts.

the risk profile of our variable annuity account values as of the periods above reflect our product risk diversification strategy and the runoff of legacy products over time.
variable annuity hedging program results under u.s. gaap, the liability for certain living benefit features is accounted for as an embedded derivative and recorded at fair value, based on assumptions a market participant would use in valuing these features. the fair value is calculated as the present value of future expected benefit payments to contractholders less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the applicable living benefit features using option pricing techniques. see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the methodology and assumptions used in calculating the fair value under u.s. gaap.
as noted within "-variable annuity risks and risk mitigants" above, we maintain a hedging program to help manage certain capital market risks associated with certain of these guarantees. our hedging program utilizes an internally-defined hedge target. we review our hedge target and hedging program on an ongoing basis, and may periodically adjust them based on our evaluation of the risks associated with the guarantees and other factors. as currently defined, our hedge target includes the following modifications to the assumptions used in the u.s. gaap valuation:
77
•   the impact of npr is excluded to maximize protection against the entire projected claim irrespective of the possibility of our own default.
•   the assumptions used in the projection of customer account values for fixed income and equity funds and the discounted net living benefits (claims less fees) are adjusted to reflect returns in excess of risk-free rates equal to our expectations of credit risk premiums.
•   actuarial assumptions are adjusted to remove risk margins and reflect our best estimates.
due to these modifications, we expect differences each period between the change in the value of the embedded derivative as defined by u.s. gaap and the change in the value of the hedge positions used to manage the hedge target, thus potentially increasing volatility in u.s. gaap earnings. application of the valuation methodologies described above could result in either a liability or contra-liability balance for the fair value of the embedded derivative under u.s. gaap and/or the value of the hedge target, given changing capital market conditions and various actuarial assumptions. the following table provides a reconciliation between the fair value of the embedded derivative as defined by u.s. gaap and the value of our hedge target as of the periods indicated.

we seek to offset the changes in our hedge target by entering into a range of exchange-traded, cleared and over the counter equity and interest rate derivatives to hedge certain capital market risks present in our hedge target. the instruments include, but are not limited to, interest rate swaps, swaptions, floors and caps as well as equity options, total return swaps and equity futures. the following table sets forth the market and notional values of these instruments as of the periods indicated.

(1)   includes interest rate swaps for which offsetting positions exist in corporate and other operations, reflecting the impact of managing interest rate risk through capital management strategies other than hedging of particular exposures. see "-corporate and other."
due to cash flow timing differences between our hedging instruments and the corresponding hedge target, as well as other factors such as updates to actuarial assumptions which are not hedged, the market value of the hedge portfolio compared to our hedge target measured as of any specific point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting. in addition to the derivatives held as part of the hedging program, we have cash and other invested assets available to cover the future claims payable under these guarantees and other liabilities. for additional information on the liquidity needs associated with our hedging program, see "-liquidity and capital resources-liquidity-liquidity associated with other activities-hedging activities associated with living benefit guarantees."
the primary sources of differences between the changes in the fair value of the hedge positions and the hedge target, other than changes related to actuarial assumption updates, fall into one of three categories:
•   fund performance-in order to project future account value changes, we make certain assumptions about how each underlying fund will perform. we map contractholder funds to hedgeable indices that we believe are the best representation of the liability to be hedged in the capital markets. the difference between the modeled fund performance and actual fund performance results in basis that can be either positive or negative.
78
•   net market impact-we incur rebalancing costs related to the dynamic rebalancing of the hedging instruments as markets move. our hedging program is also subject to the impact of implied and realized market volatility on the hedge positions relative to our hedge target that can lead to positive or negative results.
•   liability basis-we make assumptions about expected changes in the hedge target related to certain items, such as contractholder behavior. the difference between the actual change in the hedge target and the expected changes we have modeled results in basis that can be either positive or negative.
the net impact of the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative associated with our living benefit features and the change in the fair value of the related hedge positions is included in "realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments" and the related impact to the amortization of dac and other costs is included in "related charges," both of which are excluded from adjusted operating income. the following table shows the net impact of changes in the embedded derivative and related hedge positions, as well as the related amortization of dac and other costs, for the periods indicated.

(1)   positive amount represents income; negative amount represents a loss.
(2)   excludes the net impacts of assumption updates and other refinements, and includes rider fees received attributable to future benefit payments. the assumption update impact to the change in value of hedge target was approximately $106 million, $(1,263) million and $(1,386) million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the assumption update impact to the change in portions of u.s. gaap liability, before npr, excluded from hedge target, was approximately $(172) million, $(318) million and $(2,542) million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the assumption update impact to the change in the npr adjustment was approximately $(8) million, $618 million and $1,798 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the assumption update impact to the related benefit (charge) to amortization of dac and other costs was approximately $40 million, $332 million and $597 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
(3)   attributed fees received for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were approximately $999 million, $940 million and $862 million, respectively, and were included in "change in value of hedge target."
(4)   excludes $(585) million, $(3,036) million and $1,603 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, representing the impact of managing interest rate risk through capital management strategies other than hedging of particular exposures. because this decision is based on the capital considerations of the company as a whole, the impact is reported in corporate and other operations. see "-corporate and other."
(5)   represents the impact attributable to the difference between the value of the hedge target and the value of the embedded derivative as defined by u.s. gaap, before adjusting for npr, as discussed above.
the net gain of $894 million for 2015 primarily reflected a $2,243 million net benefit from the change in the npr adjustment, driven by net increases in the base embedded derivative liability before npr primarily due to declining interest rates and widening credit spreads. this impact was partially offset by a $547 million net charge from changes in the value of our hedge target and related hedge positions, primarily driven by fund underperformance relative to indices and unfavorable liability basis. each of these items resulted in partial offsets included in the $701 million related charge to the amortization of dac and other costs. the net charge from the impact of assumption updates and other refinements of $34 million resulted from our annual review and update of assumptions, primarily driven by modifications to our actuarial assumptions and other refinements. results also reflected the changes in the portions of the u.s. gaap liability that are excluded from our hedge target, net of related impacts to the amortization of dac and other costs.
79
the net gain of $279 million for 2014 primarily reflected a $3,824 million net benefit from the change in the npr adjustment driven by net increases in the base embedded derivative liability before npr, primarily due to declining interest rates. this impact was partially offset by a $421 million net charge from changes in the value of our hedge target and related hedge positions, primarily driven by fund underperformance relative to indices and unfavorable liability basis. each of these items resulted in partial offsets included in the $496 million related charge to the amortization of dac and other costs. the net charge from the impact of assumption updates and other refinements of $631 million was primarily driven by modifications to our actuarial assumptions, including updates to our lapse assumption, to reflect our review of emerging experience, future expectations and other data, and other refinements. results also reflected the changes in the portions of the u.s. gaap liability that are excluded from our hedge target, net of related impacts to the amortization of dac and other costs. in addition, results included a net charge of $35 million related to prior periods. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the net loss of $4,034 million for 2013 primarily reflected a $4,333 million net charge from the change in the npr adjustment driven by net decreases in the base embedded derivative liability before npr, primarily reflecting the impact of favorable capital markets conditions, as well as tightening of our npr credit spreads. in addition, results included a $231 million net charge from changes in the value of our hedge target and related hedge positions, primarily driven by fund underperformance relative to indices and an unfavorable net market impact, partially offset by favorable liability basis. each of these items resulted in partial offsets included in the $1,161 million related benefit to the amortization of dac and other costs. the net charge from the impact of assumption updates and other refinements of $1,533 million was primarily driven by modifications to our lapse rate assumptions to reflect our review of emerging experience, future expectations and other data, and other refinements. these updates increased expected claims significantly more than expected fees, which increased our net liability. results also reflected the changes in the portions of the u.s. gaap liability that are excluded from our hedge target, net of related impacts to the amortization of dac and other costs.

adjusted operating income
2015 to 2014 annual comparison. adjusted operating income decreased $284 million. our annual reviews and updates of assumptions and other refinements had no net impact in 2015, while the results for 2014 reflected a $13 million net charge. excluding this impact, adjusted operating income decreased $297 million, primarily driven by lower net investment results, higher general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, and lower fee income, partially offset by more favorable reserve impacts. the decrease in net investment spread results primarily reflected lower income on non-coupon investments, lower reinvestment rates, lower income on derivatives used in portfolio management and the impact of lower mortgage loan prepayment fees, partially offset by growth in account values primarily from significant pension risk transfer transactions. the increase in general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, was driven by business growth and costs associated with strategic initiatives. the decrease in fee income primarily reflected lower margins on full service account values and net outflows of investment-only stable value account values over the last twelve months, partially offset by higher income from longevity reinsurance account values. the more favorable reserve impacts reflected favorable mortality for pension risk transfer contracts.
2014 to 2013 annual comparison. adjusted operating income increased $176 million. our annual reviews and updates of assumptions and other refinements resulted in net charges of $13 million and $4 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively. excluding this impact, adjusted operating income increased $185 million. the increase was primarily driven by higher net investment spread results, higher fee income and a more favorable reserve impact from case experience, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization. the increase in net investment spread results reflected higher income on non-coupon investments, the impact of crediting rate reductions and higher mortgage loan prepayment fees, partially offset by lower reinvestment rates. the increase in fee income was driven by increases in account values from the contribution of significant longevity reinsurance transactions in 2014, market appreciation and higher average investment-only stable value account values. the more favorable reserve impact from case experience reflected the impact of reserve updates for certain legacy group annuity contracts and favorable mortality for longevity reinsurance contracts. the increase in general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, was primarily driven by an unfavorable comparative adjustment to the amortization of voba to reflect the impact on estimated gross profits of higher than expected lapses, as well as higher costs to support corporate initiatives and higher compensation costs.
revenues, benefits and expenses
2015 to 2014 annual comparison. revenues, as shown in the table above under "-operating results," decreased $256 million. premiums decreased $68 million, primarily driven by more significant group annuity transactions in 2014, partially offset by ongoing premiums assumed for longevity reinsurance contracts sold in 2015. net investment income decreased $127 million, primarily reflecting lower income on non-coupon investments, lower reinvestment rates and lower mortgage loan prepayment fees, partially offset by growth in account values primarily from significant pension risk transfer transactions. policy charges and fee income, asset management and service fees and other income decreased $61 million, primarily from lower fee income and lower income on derivatives used in portfolio management.
benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under "-operating results," increased $28 million. excluding the impact of our annual reviews and updates of assumptions and other refinements, as discussed above, benefits and expenses increased $41 million. general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, increased $38 million primarily driven by business growth and costs associated with strategic initiatives. policyholders' benefits, including the change in policy reserves, increased $33 million driven by interest accrued on benefit reserves, partially offset by a decrease in group annuity premiums, as discussed above and favorable mortality for pension risk transfer contracts. partially offsetting these increases was a $35 million decrease in interest credited to policyholders' account balances, primarily driven by the impact of crediting rate reductions on full service general account stable value account values.
2014 to 2013 annual comparison. revenues increased $6,049 million. premiums increased $5,896 million primarily driven by two significant group annuity transactions in 2014. this increase in premiums resulted in a corresponding increase in policyholders' benefits, as discussed below. net investment income increased $142 million primarily reflecting higher income from higher returns on non-coupon investments and mortgage loan prepayment fees, partially offset by lower reinvestment rates. policy charges and fee income, asset management and service fees and other income increased $11 million, primarily from higher fee income driven by significant longevity reinsurance transactions in 2014 and higher average investment-only stable value account values, as discussed above.
81
benefits and expenses increased $5,873 million. policyholders' benefits, including the change in policy reserves, increased $5,878 million, primarily reflecting the increase in premiums discussed above. absent this increase and the net increase from the annual reviews and updates of assumptions discussed above, benefits and expenses decreased $15 million. interest credited to policyholders' account balances decreased $53 million, primarily reflecting the impact of crediting rate reductions on full service general account stable value account values. partially offsetting this decrease was a $30 million increase in general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, primarily driven by an unfavorable comparative adjustment to the amortization of voba, and higher costs to support corporate initiatives and higher compensation costs. in addition, the amortization of dac increased $10 million reflecting amortization primarily related to significant pension risk transfer transactions in 2014, which is offset above in policyholders' benefits, including the change in policy reserves.
account values account values are a significant driver of our operating results, and are primarily driven by net additions (withdrawals) and the impact of market changes. the income we earn on our fee-based products varies with the level of fee-based account values, since many policy fees are determined by these values. the investment income and interest we credit to policyholders on our spread-based products varies with the level of general account values. to a lesser extent, changes in account values impact our pattern of amortization of dac and voba and general and administrative expenses. the following table shows the changes in the account values and net additions (withdrawals) of retirement segment products for the periods indicated. net additions (withdrawals) are plan sales and participant deposits or additions, as applicable, minus plan and participant withdrawals and benefits. account values include both internally- and externally-managed client balances as the total balances drive revenue for the retirement segment. for more information on internally-managed balances, see "-asset management."

__________
(1)   additions primarily include: group annuities calculated based on premiums received; longevity reinsurance contracts calculated as the present value of future projected benefits; and investment-only stable value contracts calculated as the fair value of customers' funds held in a client-owned trust.
(2)   prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
(3)   "other" activity includes the effect of foreign exchange rate changes associated with our united kingdom longevity reinsurance business and changes in asset balances for externally-managed accounts.
2015 to 2014 annual comparison. the increase in full service account values primarily reflected the impact of net additions in 2015. the increase in net additions was driven by higher large plan sales and lower large plan lapses, partially offset by higher net participant withdrawals.
the increase in institutional investment products account values reflected net additions resulting from significant pension risk transfer transactions in 2015 and a bank-owned life insurance stable value transaction in the second quarter of 2015, partially offset by net withdrawals of investment-only stable value accounts. the decrease in net additions was primarily driven by two significant longevity reinsurance transactions in 2014.
2014 to 2013 annual comparison. the increase in full service account values primarily reflects the impact of equity market appreciation in 2014 on the market value of customer funds. the decrease in net additions was primarily due to net participant withdrawals in 2014 compared to net participant additions in the prior year, partially offset by an increase from net plan sales.
82
the increase in institutional investment products account values was primarily driven by $36.4 billion of additions resulting from significant pension risk transfer transactions in 2014, including $31.7 billion of longevity reinsurance transactions. partially offsetting this increase was net withdrawals of investment-only stable value accounts, primarily driven by existing intermediary relationships reaching saturation levels and an increase in the number of competitors in the marketplace.

adjusted operating income
2015 to 2014 annual comparison. adjusted operating income decreased $6 million. higher asset management fees from growth in assets under management were more than offset by higher expenses, including distribution costs associated with higher retail sales and expenses relating to business growth initiatives. the decrease also reflected lower other related revenues, net of expenses, primarily related to lower strategic investing results.
2014 to 2013 annual comparison. adjusted operating income increased $62 million. the increase primarily reflected higher asset management fees, net of expenses, from growth in assets under management. the increase also reflected higher other related revenues, net of expenses, primarily related to higher performance-based incentive fees, partially offset by lower commercial mortgage results.

(2)   includes mortgage origination and spread lending revenues of our commercial mortgage origination and servicing business.
(3)   future revenues will be impacted by the level and diversification of our strategic investments, the commercial real estate market, and other domestic and international markets.
(4)   includes payments from wells fargo under an agreement dated as of july 30, 2004, implementing arrangements with respect to money market mutual funds in connection with the combination of our retail securities brokerage and clearing operations with those of wells fargo. the agreement extends for ten years after termination of the wachovia securities joint venture, which occurred on december 31, 2009. the revenue from wells fargo under this agreement was $78 million in 2015, $77 million in 2014 and $75 million in 2013.
2015 to 2014 annual comparison. revenues, as shown in the table above under "-operating results," increased $104 million. asset management fees increased $114 million primarily as a result of higher assets under management due to positive net asset flows and market appreciation. service, distribution and other revenues increased $11 million reflecting higher fees from certain consolidated funds, which were partially offset by higher expenses related to noncontrolling interests in these funds. partially offsetting these increases was a $15 million decrease in strategic investing revenues, primarily reflecting a gain on the sale of an investment in the prior year.
expenses, as shown in the table above under "-operating results," increased $110 million, including expenses related to business growth initiatives, commissions from higher retail sales and higher expenses related to revenues associated with certain consolidated funds, as discussed above.
2014 to 2013 annual comparison. revenues, as shown in the table above under "-operating results," increased $162 million. asset management fees increased $140 million primarily as a result of higher assets under management due to market appreciation and positive net asset flows. performance-based incentive fees increased $29 million primarily related to certain fixed income funds. service, distribution and other revenues increased $14 million mainly reflecting higher fees and net investment income related to certain consolidated funds. partially offsetting these increases was a $15 million decrease in commercial mortgage revenues, driven by the continued run off of the interim loan portfolio.
expenses, as shown in the table above under "-operating results," increased $100 million, primarily driven by higher compensation costs.

on january 2, 2013, we acquired the hartford life business through a reinsurance transaction. the integration of the hartford life business has been completed. we incurred approximately $110 million of pre-tax integration costs, inclusive of capitalized expenses, relative to expected costs of $120 million and have achieved annualized cost savings of approximately $90 million on a run rate basis, consistent with our expectations.
adjusted operating income
2015 to 2014 annual comparison. adjusted operating income increased $137 million. results for 2015 reflected a net benefit of $68 million from our annual review and update of assumptions and other refinements, while results for 2014 included a $63 million net charge from these updates. in addition, the current year included $17 million of costs associated with the integration of the hartford life business, while the prior year included $32 million of such costs. excluding these impacts, adjusted operating income decreased $9 million. this decrease was primarily driven by less favorable mortality experience, inclusive of associated reserve updates and amortization, net of reinsurance, and a lower contribution from investment results driven by lower income on non-coupon investments, partially offset by growth of our universal and term life businesses.

(1)   single pay life annualized new business premiums, which include 10% of excess (unscheduled) premiums, represented approximately 17%, 10% and 36% of guaranteed universal life and 7%, 8%, and 9% of other universal life annualized new business premiums for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
2015 to 2014 annual comparison. annualized new business premiums increased $139 million, primarily driven by pricing and other actions we have taken to enhance and diversify product sales.
2014 to 2013 annual comparison. annualized new business premiums decreased $279 million primarily driven by pricing and other actions taken in 2013 to limit the concentration of sales of the universal life insurance product with secondary, or "no-lapse," guarantees and the discontinuation of the hartford life business products.

adjusted operating income
2015 to 2014 annual comparison. adjusted operating income increased $153 million, primarily reflecting favorable comparative net impacts from our annual reviews and updates of assumptions and other refinements. results for 2015 included a $28 million net benefit from these updates related to actuarial assumptions used in calculating both group disability and group life reserves and other refinements, while results for 2014 included a $107 million net charge from these updates. excluding the effect of these items, adjusted operating income increased $18 million primarily driven by more favorable underwriting results in our group disability business and lower expenses, partially offset by a lower contribution from net investment spread results and less favorable underwriting results in our group life business. the favorable underwriting results for our group disability business reflected the impact of higher claim resolutions and fewer new claims for long-term contracts, while the less favorable underwriting results for our group life business reflected lower premiums due to lapsed business.
89
2014 to 2013 annual comparison. adjusted operating income decreased $134 million, primarily reflecting unfavorable comparative net impacts from our annual reviews and updates of assumptions and other refinements. results for 2014 included a $107 million net charge from these updates, which included a $48 million net charge for certain group disability reserves related to prior periods. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. results for 2013 included a $45 million net benefit from these updates. excluding the effect of these items, adjusted operating income increased $18 million primarily driven by more favorable underwriting results in our group disability business and a higher contribution from net investment spread results, partially offset by higher expenses and less favorable underwriting results in our group life business. the more favorable underwriting results for our group disability business reflected the impact of higher claim resolutions and fewer new claims, partially offset by higher claim severity for long-term contracts. the less favorable underwriting results for the group life business reflected higher claim severity for non-experience-rated contracts, partially offset by more favorable results for experience-rated contracts.
revenues, benefits and expenses
2015 to 2014 annual comparison. revenues, as shown in the table above under "-operating results," decreased $214 million. excluding a favorable impact of $2 million resulting from our annual reviews and updates of assumptions and other refinements, as discussed above, revenues decreased $216 million. the decrease reflected $160 million lower premiums and policy charges and fee income in both our group life and group disability businesses primarily driven by lapses resulting from continued pricing discipline on contract renewals and improved claim experience for experience-rated contracts. net investment income decreased $27 million driven by lower income from non-coupon investments.
benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under "-operating results," decreased $367 million. excluding a favorable impact of $133 million resulting from our annual review and update of assumptions and other refinements, as discussed above, benefits and expenses decreased $234 million. policyholders' benefits, including the change in reserves, decreased $198 million, driven by declines in both our group disability and group life businesses, reflecting fewer claims as a result of lapses. the decline in our group disability business also reflected the impact of higher claim resolutions for long-term contracts. the decline in our group life business also reflected improved claim experience for experience-rated contracts.
2014 to 2013 annual comparison. revenues decreased $161 million. excluding a favorable impact of $51 million resulting from our annual reviews and updates of assumptions and other refinements, as discussed above, revenues decreased $212 million. the decrease reflected $239 million lower premiums and policy charges and fee income in both our group life and group disability businesses driven by lapses resulting from continued pricing discipline on contract renewals. partially offsetting the decrease was a $28 million increase in net investment income driven by higher income from non-coupon investments.
benefits and expenses decreased $27 million. excluding an unfavorable impact of $203 million resulting from our annual reviews and updates of assumptions and other refinements, as discussed above, benefits and expenses decreased $230 million. policyholders' benefits, including the change in reserves, decreased $287 million, driven by declines in both our group life and group disability businesses, reflecting fewer claims as a result of lapses. the decline in our group life business also reflected improved claim experience for experience-rated contracts. the decline in our disability business also reflected higher claim resolutions, partially offset by higher claim severity for long-term contracts. partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of $41 million in general and administrative expenses, including higher compensation costs, costs associated with our claims management process, and other costs to support business initiatives.

international insurance division foreign currency exchange rate movements and related hedging strategies as a u.s.-based company with significant business operations outside the u.s., particularly in japan, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate movements that could impact our u.s. dollar-equivalent shareholder return on equity. we seek to mitigate this impact through various hedging strategies, including the use of derivative contracts and by holding u.s. dollar-denominated assets in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.
the operations of our international insurance division are subject to currency fluctuations that can materially affect our u.s. dollar-equivalent earnings from period to period, even if earnings on a local currency basis are relatively constant. we enter into forward currency derivative contracts as part of our strategy to effectively fix the currency exchange rates for a portion of our prospective non-u.s. dollar-denominated earnings streams, thereby reducing earnings volatility from foreign currency exchange rate movements. the forward currency hedging program is primarily associated with our insurance operations in japan and korea.
separately, our japanese insurance operations offer a variety of non-yen denominated products, primarily comprised of u.s. and australian dollar-denominated products that are supported by investments in corresponding currencies. while these non-yen denominated assets and liabilities are economically matched, prior to 2015, differences in the accounting for changes in the value of these assets and liabilities due to changes in foreign currency exchange rate movements resulted in volatility in reported u.s. gaap earnings. as a result of continued growth in these portfolios, effective in the first quarter of 2015, we implemented a new structure in gibraltar life that disaggregated the u.s. and australian dollar-denominated businesses into separate divisions, each with its own functional currency that aligns with the underlying products and investments.
for further information on the hedging strategies used to mitigate the risks of foreign currency exchange rate movements on earnings as well as the u.s. gaap earnings impact from products denominated in non-local currencies, see "-impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on earnings."
we utilize a yen hedging strategy that calibrates the hedge level to preserve the relative contribution of our yen-based business to the company's overall return on equity on a leverage neutral basis. we implement this hedging strategy utilizing a variety of instruments, including foreign currency derivative contracts, as discussed above, as well as u.s. dollar-denominated assets and, to a lesser extent, "dual currency" and "synthetic dual currency" assets held locally in our japanese insurance subsidiaries. we may also hedge using instruments held in our u.s. domiciled entities, such as u.s. dollar-denominated debt that has been swapped to yen. the total hedge level may vary based on our periodic assessment of the relative contribution of our yen-based business to the company's overall return on equity.
the table below presents the aggregate amount of instruments that serve to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange movements on our u.s. dollar-equivalent shareholder return on equity from our japanese insurance subsidiaries for the periods indicated.

__________
(1)   represents the notional amount of forward currency contracts outstanding.
(2)   excludes $30.5 billion and $29.1 billion as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, of u.s. dollar assets supporting u.s. dollar liabilities related to u.s. dollar-denominated products issued by our japanese insurance operations.
(3)   the yen-denominated liabilities are reported in corporate and other operations.
(4)   dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments are held by our yen-based entities in the form of fixed maturities and loans with a yen-denominated principal component and u.s. dollar-denominated interest income. the amounts shown represent the present value of future u.s. dollar cash flows.
the u.s. dollar-denominated investments that hedge the u.s. dollar-equivalent shareholder return on equity from our japanese insurance operations are reported within yen-based entities and, as a result, foreign currency exchange rate movements will impact their value reported within our yen-based japanese insurance entities. we seek to mitigate the risk that future unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements will decrease the value of these u.s. dollar-denominated investments reported within our yen-based japanese insurance entities, and therefore negatively impact their equity and regulatory solvency margins, by employing internal hedging strategies between a subsidiary of prudential financial and these yen-based entities. these internal hedging strategies have the economic effect of moving the change in value of these u.s. dollar-denominated investments due to foreign currency exchange rate movements from our japanese yen-based entities to our u.s. dollar-based entities.
these u.s. dollar-denominated investments also pay a coupon which is generally higher than what a similar yen-denominated investment would pay. the incremental impact of this higher yield on our u.s. dollar-denominated investments, as well as our dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments discussed below, will vary over time, and is dependent on the duration of the underlying investments as well as interest rate environments in both the u.s. and japan at the time of the investments. see "-general account investments-investment results" for a discussion of the investment yields generated by our japanese insurance operations.
impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on earnings forward currency hedging program the financial results of our international insurance segment reflect the impact of an intercompany arrangement with corporate and other operations pursuant to which certain of the segment's non-u.s. dollar-denominated earnings are translated at fixed currency exchange rates. the fixed rates are determined in connection with a foreign currency income hedging program designed to mitigate the impact of exchange rate changes on the segment's u.s. dollar-equivalent earnings. pursuant to this program, corporate and other operations execute forward currency contracts with third parties to sell the net exposure of projected earnings for certain currencies in exchange for u.s. dollars at specified exchange rates. the maturities of these contracts correspond with the future periods (typically on a three year rolling basis) in which the identified non-u.s. dollar-denominated earnings are expected to be generated. in establishing the level of non-u.s. dollar-denominated earnings that will be hedged through this program, we exclude the anticipated level of u.s. dollar-denominated earnings that will be generated by dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments, as well as the anticipated level of non-yen denominated earnings that will be generated by non-yen denominated products and investments. for the twelve months ended december 31, 2015, approximately 36% of the segment's earnings were yen-based and, as of december 31, 2015, we have hedged 100%, 73% and 28% of expected yen-based earnings for 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. to the extent currently unhedged, our international insurance segment's future expected u.s. dollar-equivalent of yen-based earnings will be impacted by yen exchange rate movements.
92
as a result of this intercompany arrangement, our international insurance segment's results for 2013, 2014 and 2015 reflect the impact of translating yen-denominated earnings at fixed currency exchange rates of 80, 82 and 91 yen per u.s. dollar, respectively, and korean won-denominated earnings at fixed currency exchange rates of 1160, 1150 and 1120 korean won per u.s. dollar, respectively. our results for 2016 will reflect the impact of translating yen-denominated earnings at a fixed currency exchange rate of 106 yen per u.s. dollar and korean won-denominated earnings at a fixed currency exchange rate of 1100 korean won per u.s. dollar. since determination of the fixed currency exchange rates for each respective year is impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates over time, the segment's future earnings will ultimately be impacted by these changes in exchange rates.
results of corporate and other operations include any differences between the translation adjustments recorded by the segment at the fixed currency exchange rate versus the actual average rate during the period, and the gains or losses recorded from the forward currency contracts that settled during the period, which include the impact of any over or under hedging of actual earnings that differ from projected earnings. results of corporate and other operations also include any differences between the translation adjustments recorded by the segment at the fixed currency exchange rate versus the actual average rate during the period related to currencies for which we choose not to hedge our exposure. the table below presents, for the periods indicated, the increase (decrease) to revenues and adjusted operating income for the international insurance segment and for corporate and other operations, reflecting the impact of this intercompany arrangement.

(1)   represents the difference between non-u.s. dollar-denominated earnings translated on the basis of weighted average monthly currency exchange rates versus fixed currency exchange rates determined in connection with the forward currency hedging program.
as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, the notional amounts of these forward currency contracts were $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, of which $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, were related to our japanese insurance operations.
u.s. gaap earnings impact of products denominated in non-local currencies our international insurance operations primarily offer products denominated in local currency; however, several of our international insurance operations, most notably our japanese operations, also offer products denominated in non-local currencies, primarily comprised of u.s. and australian dollar-denominated products. the non-yen denominated insurance liabilities related to these products are supported by investments denominated in corresponding currencies, including a significant portion designated as available-for-sale. while the impact from foreign currency exchange rate movements on these non-yen denominated assets and liabilities is economically matched, differences in the accounting for changes in the value of these assets and liabilities due to changes in foreign currency exchange rate movements have historically resulted in volatility in u.s. gaap earnings. for example, unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments, including those arising from non-functional currency exchange rate movements, are recorded in aoci, whereas the non-functional currency-denominated liabilities are remeasured for foreign currency exchange rate movements, and the related changes in value are recorded in earnings within "other income." investments designated as held-to-maturity under u.s. gaap are recorded at amortized cost on the balance sheet, but are remeasured for foreign currency exchange rate movements, with the related change in value recorded in earnings within "other income." due to this non-economic volatility that is reflected in u.s. gaap earnings, the gains (losses) resulting from the remeasurement of these non-yen denominated liabilities, and certain related non-yen denominated assets, were excluded from adjusted operating income and included in "realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments."
93
as discussed above, to minimize volatility in reported u.s. gaap earnings arising from foreign currency remeasurement, in the first quarter of 2015 we implemented a structure in gibraltar life that disaggregated the u.s. and australian dollar-denominated businesses into separate divisions, each with its own functional currency that aligns with the underlying products and investments. included in "realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments" were net gains of $63 million, net losses of $3,073 million and net losses of $3,962 million from foreign currency remeasurement for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. for the u.s. and australian dollar-denominated assets that were transferred under the new structure in gibraltar life, the net cumulative unrealized investment gains associated with foreign exchange remeasurement that were recorded in aoci totaled $6.0 billion and will be recognized in earnings within "realized investment gains (losses), net" over time as the assets mature or are sold. as of december 31, 2015, the remaining net cumulative unrealized investment gains balance related to these assets was $5.1 billion. absent the sale of any of these assets prior to their stated maturity, approximately 9% of the $5.1 billion balance will be recognized in 2016 and approximately 8% will be recognized in 2017, with the remainder primarily recognized over the following ten years.
international insurance operating results the results of our international insurance operations are translated on the basis of weighted average monthly exchange rates, inclusive of the effects of the intercompany arrangement discussed above. to provide a better understanding of operating performance within the international insurance segment, where indicated below, we have analyzed our results of operations excluding the effect of the year over year change in foreign currency exchange rates for which the net impact has been recorded within "other income." our results of operations, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, were derived by translating foreign currencies to u.s. dollars at uniform exchange rates for all periods presented, including for constant dollar information discussed below. the exchange rates used were japanese yen at a rate of 106 yen per u.s. dollar and korean won at a rate of 1100 won per u.s. dollar, both of which were determined in connection with the foreign currency income hedging program discussed above. in addition, for constant dollar information discussed below, activity denominated in u.s. dollars is generally reported based on the amounts as transacted in u.s. dollars. annualized new business premiums presented on a constant exchange rate basis in the "sales results" section below reflect translation based on these same uniform exchange rates.

adjusted operating income
2015 to 2014 annual comparison. adjusted operating income from life planner operations decreased $4 million including a net unfavorable impact of $56 million from currency fluctuations, inclusive of the currency hedging program discussed above. both periods included the impact of our annual reviews and updates of assumptions and other refinements, which resulted in an $11 million net charge in 2015 compared to a $17 million net benefit in 2014. results for 2014 also included a $24 million net unfavorable impact primarily from reserve refinements in our korean and japanese operations.
excluding the effect of these items, adjusted operating income increased $56 million primarily reflecting growth of business in force driven by sales results and continued strong persistency, partially offset by the impacts of higher expenses supporting business growth, lower net investment spreads and less favorable mortality experience.
adjusted operating income from our gibraltar life and other operations decreased $22 million including a net unfavorable impact of $77 million from currency fluctuations, inclusive of the currency hedging program discussed above. both periods included the impact of our annual reviews and updates of assumptions and other refinements which resulted in a $10 million net charge in 2015 compared to a $15 million net charge in 2014. results for 2014 also included a $73 million charge for reserve refinements, $30 million of which was related to 2014 and $43 million of which was related to prior periods. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
excluding the effect of these items, adjusted operating income decreased $23 million primarily reflecting higher expenses due to business growth and the absence of gains on sales of fixed assets that occurred in 2014, partially offset by a higher contribution from net investment spreads.
2014 to 2013 annual comparison. adjusted operating income from life planner operations increased $72 million including a net unfavorable impact of $16 million from currency fluctuations, inclusive of the currency hedging program discussed above. both periods included the impact of our annual reviews and updates of assumptions and other refinements, which resulted in a $17 million net benefit in 2014 compared to a $19 million net benefit in 2013. results for 2014 also included a $24 million net unfavorable impact primarily from reserve refinements in our korean and japanese operations, compared to a $78 million charge to strengthen reserves in 2013 primarily for certain policies on a previously-acquired business.
excluding the effect of these items, adjusted operating income increased $36 million primarily reflecting growth of business in force driven by sales results and continued strong persistency, as well as more favorable mortality experience, partially offset by higher expenses.
adjusted operating income from our gibraltar life and other operations increased $28 million including a net unfavorable impact of $39 million from currency fluctuations, inclusive of the currency hedging program discussed above. both periods included the impact of our annual reviews and updates of assumptions and other refinements which resulted in a $15 million net charge in 2014 compared to a $108 million net charge in 2013. results for 2014 also included a $73 million charge for reserve refinements, as discussed above. results for 2013 also included a $66 million gain on our investment, through a consortium, in china pacific group, for which our remaining shares were sold in january 2013, as well as $28 million of integration costs related to the acquisition of the star and edison businesses and a $23 million charge for reserve refinements.
excluding the effect of these items, adjusted operating income increased $62 million primarily reflecting higher net investment spreads, gains on sales of fixed assets that occurred in 2014, the absence of certain policyholder dividend refinements that occurred in 2013 and lower expenses. partially offsetting these variances was a lesser impact from accelerated earnings due to surrenders of fixed annuities denominated in australian and u.s. dollars, as well as less favorable mortality experience.
revenues, benefits and expenses
2015 to 2014 annual comparison. revenues from our life planner operations, as shown in the table above under "-operating results," decreased $95 million including a net unfavorable impact of $857 million from currency fluctuations. excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, revenues increased $762 million. this increase was primarily driven by higher premiums and policy charges and fee income of $547 million related to growth of business in force. net investment income increased $158 million primarily reflecting investment portfolio growth, partially offset by the impact of lower reinvestment rates.
95
benefits and expenses from our life planner operations, as shown in the table above under "-operating results," decreased $91 million including a net favorable impact of $801 million from currency fluctuations. excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, benefits and expenses increased $710 million. policyholder benefits, including changes in reserves, increased $520 million primarily driven by business growth. general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, increased $116 million primarily due to higher distribution costs and other costs supporting business growth. amortization of dac increased $66 million, driven by business growth.
revenues from our gibraltar life and other operations decreased $607 million, including a net unfavorable impact of $928 million from currency fluctuations. excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, revenues increased $321 million, driven by a $306 million increase in premiums and policy charges and fee income due to business growth, and an $89 million increase in net investment income driven by higher net investment spreads. these increases were partially offset by a decline of $57 million in other income, primarily reflecting the absence of gains on sales of fixed assets that occurred in 2014.
benefits and expenses of our gibraltar life and other operations decreased $585 million including a net favorable impact of $851 million from currency fluctuations. excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, benefits and expenses increased $266 million, primarily reflecting a $272 million increase in policyholder benefits, including changes in reserves, driven by business growth.
2014 to 2013 annual comparison. revenues from our life planner operations increased $289 million including a net unfavorable impact of $392 million from currency fluctuations. excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, revenues increased $681 million. this increase was primarily driven by higher premiums and policy charges and fee income of $391 million related to growth of business in force. net investment income increased $143 million primarily reflecting investment portfolio growth, partially offset by the impact of lower reinvestment rates.
benefits and expenses from our life planner operations increased $217 million including a net favorable impact of $376 million from currency fluctuations. excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, benefits and expenses increased $593 million. policyholder benefits, including changes in reserves, increased $503 million primarily driven by business growth. these items were partially offset by favorable mortality experience and lesser comparative reserve refinements, as discussed above. general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, increased $71 million primarily due to higher distribution costs and technology expenditures.
revenues from our gibraltar life and other operations decreased $2,763 million, including a net unfavorable impact of $316 million from currency fluctuations. excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, revenues decreased $2,447 million, driven by a $2,366 million decrease in premiums and policy charges and fee income. the decrease in premiums and policy charges and fee income primarily reflected the discontinuation of bank channel sales of yen-denominated single premium reduced death benefit whole life products and pricing actions taken on certain retirement and protection products in 2013, as well as lower premiums from the life consultant distribution channel and reserve refinements, as discussed above. the decrease in revenues also included the impact of $66 million from the sale of our investment in china pacific group during the first quarter of 2013, as discussed above.
benefits and expenses of our gibraltar life and other operations decreased $2,791 million including a net favorable impact of $277 million from currency fluctuations. excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, benefits and expenses decreased $2,514 million. policyholder benefits, including changes in reserves, decreased $2,446 million driven by the discontinuation of bank channel sales of yen-denominated single premium reduced death benefit whole life products and pricing actions taken on certain retirement and protection products in 2013.

annualized new business premiums, on a constant exchange rate basis, from our life planner operations increased $62 million. results reflected higher sales of whole life products and annuity products in our korean operation and of whole life products and accident and health products in our brazilian operation. these increases were partially offset by a net decline in sales in our japanese operations where commission rate changes resulted in lower sales of certain retirement products that more than offset an increase in sales of term life products.
annualized new business premiums, on a constant exchange rate basis, from our gibraltar life operations decreased $92 million. bank channel sales decreased $94 million due to the discontinuation of our yen-denominated single premium reduced death benefit whole life products in the fourth quarter of 2013, partially offset by higher sales of u.s. and australian dollar-denominated annuity products and u.s. dollar-denominated whole life products. life consultant sales decreased $38 million primarily due to pricing actions taken in the second quarter of 2013 on certain retirement and protection products as well as a lower life consultant count, partially offset by higher sales of australian dollar-denominated annuity products. independent agency sales increased $40 million primarily driven by higher sales australian dollar-denominated annuity products.

2015 to 2014 comparison. the number of life planners increased by 240, driven by increases of 200 in japan and 190 in brazil as a result of recruiting efforts. life planner decreases in other operations, primarily in poland and italy, were a result of more selective recruiting efforts and validation requirements.
the number of gibraltar life consultants increased by 98, primarily reflecting improved recruiting efforts and fewer terminations.
2014 to 2013 comparison. the number of life planners increased by 104, driven by an increase of 140 in brazil as a result of recruiting efforts and agency growth. life planner growth in japan of 70 was offset by a decline of 73 in korea as a result of a more stringent selection process.
the number of gibraltar life consultants decreased by 620, primarily reflecting the continuation of terminating life consultants for not meeting minimum sales production standards as part of an ongoing competency assessment.

(1)   includes consolidating adjustments.
2015 to 2014 annual comparison. the loss from corporate and other operations, on an adjusted operating income basis, decreased $35 million. operating debt interest expense, net of investment income, decreased $195 million, reflecting higher net investment income due to higher levels of invested assets, including the transfer of assets to corporate and other operations related to the restructuring of the former closed block business and lower operating debt interest expense due to the reassignment of operating debt to capital debt. capital debt interest expense increased $105 million, primarily reflecting the reassignment of operating debt to capital debt to support capital needs related to our living benefits hedging program described in "-liquidity and capital resources-capital protection framework." net charges from other corporate activities increased $43 million, primarily reflecting increased retained corporate expenses, including $80 million of estimated remediation costs related to the administration of certain separate account investments. these remediation costs consist of compensation for the benefit of customers for performance on certain securities lending activities administered by the company. in addition, the increased retained corporate expenses included enhanced regulatory supervision costs and a negative impact recorded in corporate and other operations from income translation adjustments recorded by our international insurance segment at fixed currency exchange rates versus the actual average rates related to currencies for which we choose not to hedge our exchange rate exposure. these increases were partially offset by a favorable comparative impact from escheatment related and other items.
results from pension and employee benefits decreased $12 million, including higher expenses from our non-qualified pension plan driven by unfavorable census and assumption updates as of december 31, 2014. this decrease was partially offset by higher income from our qualified pension plan driven by the impact of the decline in interest rates in 2014, partially offset by the negative impact of our mortality assumption update as of december 31, 2014, following the society of actuaries' final issuance in october 2014 of a study of mortality rates and expected future improvement in mortality rates for u.s. benefit plan participants.
for purposes of calculating pension income from our qualified pension plan for the year ended december 31, 2016, we will increase the discount rate to 4.50% from 4.10% in 2015. the expected rate of return on plan assets and the assumed rate of increase in compensation will remain unchanged at 6.25% and 4.50%, respectively. giving effect to the foregoing assumptions and other factors, we expect income from our qualified pension plan in 2016 to be approximately $50 million to $60 million lower than 2015 levels. the decrease is driven by lower expected returns on plan assets due to lower than expected plan fixed income asset growth in 2015 as well as higher interest costs on the plan obligation due to the higher discount rate.
for purposes of calculating postretirement benefit expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016, we will increase the discount rate to 4.35% from 3.95%. the expected rate of return on plan assets will remain unchanged at 7.00%. giving effect to the foregoing assumptions and other factors, we expect postretirement benefit expenses in 2016 to be approximately $15 million to $25 million higher than 2015 levels. the increase in expenses is driven by higher amortization of actuarial losses and lower expected returns on plan assets due to lower than expected asset growth in 2015.

in 2016, pension and other postretirement benefit service costs related to active employees will continue to be allocated to our business segments. for further information regarding our pension and postretirement plans, see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
2014 to 2013 annual comparison. the loss from corporate and other operations, on an adjusted operating income basis, decreased $22 million. net charges from other corporate activities declined $37 million, primarily reflecting reduced retained corporate expenses, including lower compensation related costs, and the absence of the accelerated recognition of deferred bond issuance costs related to capital and operating debt redeemed in 2013. these reductions were partially offset by increased costs for enhanced regulatory supervision, an unfavorable comparative impact for the change in our estimate of payments arising from use of the social security master death file matching criteria to identify both deceased policy and contractholders, and an unfavorable impact from our annual reviews and updates of assumptions on the reserves for certain retained obligations relating to pre-demutualization policyholders. capital debt interest expense decreased $29 million, primarily driven by the replacement of higher coupon debt with new issuances at lower rates during 2013. operating debt interest expense, net of investment income, decreased $14 million driven by higher income on higher levels of invested assets.
results from pension and employee benefits decreased $58 million. income from our qualified pension plan decreased $80 million driven by lower expected returns from a decline in value of fixed income plan assets and higher interest costs on the plan obligation from a higher discount rate. additionally, an unfavorable comparative impact of retained benefit expenses, including the impact of plan amendments in 2013, contributed to the decline in pension and employee benefits results. these declines were partially offset by lower post-retirement plan expense driven by higher expected returns from an increase in value of equity plan assets and lower post-employment plan expense driven by favorable 2014 census and assumption updates.
capital protection framework results related to our capital protection framework hedging costs that are included in adjusted operating income were $19 million, $39 million and $45 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the lower hedge costs correspond to the relative equity market index levels at the time of hedging our equity market exposure. "realized investment gains (losses), net and related adjustments," which are excluded from adjusted operating income, included net losses of $673 million, net losses of $3,694 million and net gains of $2,077 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily resulting from our utilization of capital management strategies to manage a portion of our interest rate risk, and reflect changes in interest rates with respect to the exposures outstanding during the respective periods. for more information on our capital protection framework, see "-liquidity and capital resources-capital protection framework."

long-term care. results for the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily reflected an unfavorable impact from our annual review and update of assumptions and other refinements, as well as unfavorable policy experience. results for the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily reflected realized gains from derivatives used in duration management, driven by the impact of declining interest rates and favorable policy experience.
residential real estate brokerage franchise and relocation services. results for the year ended december 31, 2013 included pre-tax gains of $51 million from the sales of investments in real estate brokerage franchises.
closed block division the closed block division includes certain in force traditional domestic participating life insurance and annuity products and assets that are used for the payment of benefits, expenses and policyholder dividends related to these policies, as well as certain related assets and liabilities. we no longer offer these traditional domestic participating policies. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.
each year, the board of directors of prudential insurance determines the dividends payable on participating policies for the following year based on the experience of the closed block, including investment income, net realized and unrealized investment gains, mortality experience and other factors. although closed block experience for dividend action decisions is based upon statutory results, at the time the closed block was established, we developed, as required by u.s. gaap, an actuarial calculation of the timing of the maximum future earnings from the policies included in the closed block. if actual cumulative earnings in any given period are greater than the cumulative earnings we expected, we record this excess as a policyholder dividend obligation. we will subsequently pay this excess to closed block policyholders as an additional dividend unless it is otherwise offset by future closed block performance that is less favorable than we originally expected. the policyholder dividends we charge to expense within the closed block division will include any change in our policyholder dividend obligation that we recognize for the excess of actual cumulative earnings in any given period over the cumulative earnings we expected in addition to the actual policyholder dividends declared by the board of directors of prudential insurance.
as of december 31, 2015, the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was $1,694 million, which was recorded as a policyholder dividend obligation. actual cumulative earnings, as required by u.s. gaap, reflect the recognition of realized investment gains and losses in the current period, as well as changes in assets and related liabilities that support the closed block policies. additionally, the accumulation of net unrealized investment gains that have arisen subsequent to the establishment of the closed block have been reflected as a policyholder dividend obligation of $2,815 million at december 31, 2015, to be paid to closed block policyholders unless offset by future experience, with a corresponding amount reported in aoci.
operating results the following table sets forth the closed block division's results for the periods indicated.

income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures
2015 to 2014 annual comparison. income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures increased $317 million, reflecting the absence of a $487 million charge representing a make-whole provision for early redemption of the ihc debt and the cost of terminating associated interest rate swaps, $13 million of bank and legal fees related to the ihc debt redemption and class b repurchase and $13 million for the acceleration of the amortization of ihc debt issuance cost in 2014. excluding the effects of these items, income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures decreased $196 million, reflecting a $367 million decrease in net realized investment gains primarily due to lower gains from sales of fixed maturities, less favorable changes in the value of derivatives and higher impairments of invested assets. net investment income decreased $354 million primarily due to the sale and transfer of invested assets as a result of the restructuring of the former closed block business and lower income from non-coupon investments. net insurance activity results declined $104 million primarily reflecting the runoff of policies in force and higher dividends to policyholders as a result of an increase in the 2015 and 2016 dividend scales. general and administrative expenses, inclusive of interest expense, declined $122 million primarily driven by lower interest expense, reflecting the redemption in 2014 of the ihc debt. as a result of the above and other variances, a $137 million increase in the policyholder dividend obligation was recorded in 2015, compared to a $671 million increase in 2014. as noted above, as of december 31, 2015, the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was $1,694 million. if actual cumulative earnings fall below expected cumulative earnings in future periods, earnings volatility in the closed block division, which is primarily due to changes in investment results, may not be offset by changes in the policyholder dividend obligation. for a discussion of closed block division realized investment gains (losses), net, see "-realized investment gains and losses."
2014 to 2013 annual comparison. income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures decreased $321 million. results for 2014 included a $487 million charge representing a make-whole provision for early redemption of the ihc debt and the cost of terminating associated interest rate swaps, $13 million of bank and legal fees related to the ihc debt redemption and class b repurchase and $13 million for the acceleration of the amortization of ihc debt issuance cost. excluding the effects of these items, income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures increased $192 million, reflecting a $968 million increase in net realized investment gains, reflecting favorable changes in the value of derivatives and higher trading gains on fixed maturities and equity securities. net insurance activity results declined $72 million primarily reflecting higher dividends to policyholders as a result of an increase in the 2014 and 2015 dividend scales. the value of trading account assets declined $22 million primarily due to foreign currency translation losses on fixed maturities. as a result of the above and other variances, a $671 million increase in the policyholder dividend obligation was recorded in 2014, compared to a $2 million increase in 2013.
revenues, benefits and expenses
2015 to 2014 annual comparison. revenues, as shown in the table above under "-operating results," decreased $746 million, primarily driven by a $354 million decrease in net investment income and a $328 million decrease in net realized investment gains, as discussed above. the $328 million decrease in net realized investment gains included the absence of $39 million realized loss from termination of interest rate swaps related to the early redemption of the ihc debt in 2014. in addition, premiums declined $35 million, primarily due to the runoff of policies in force.
benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under "-operating results," decreased $1,063 million, primarily driven by a $596 million decrease in general and administrative expenses, inclusive of interest expense, including the absence of a $448 million charge on a make-whole provision for early redemption of the ihc debt, $13 million of bank and legal fees related to the ihc debt redemption and class b repurchase and $13 million for the acceleration of the amortization of ihc debt issuance cost in 2014, as discussed above. dividends to policyholders decreased $505 million, reflecting a decrease in the policyholder dividend obligation expense due to changes in cumulative earnings, partially offset by an increase in dividends paid and accrued to policyholders as a result of an increase in the 2015 and 2016 dividend scales.
102
2014 to 2013 annual comparison. revenues increased $870 million, primarily driven by a $929 million increase in net realized investment gains, partially offset by a $24 million decline in premiums, as discussed above. the $929 million increase in net realized investment gains included a $39 million realized loss from termination of interest rate swaps related to the early redemption of the ihc debt.
benefits and expenses increased $1,191 million, primarily driven by a $725 million increase in dividends to policyholders, reflecting an increase in the policyholder dividend obligation expense due to changes in cumulative earnings and an increase in dividends paid and accrued to policyholders as a result of an increase in the 2014 and 2015 dividend scales, partially offset by the runoff of policies in force. general and administrative expenses, inclusive of interest expense, increased $474 million, including a $448 million charge on a make-whole provision for early redemption of the ihc debt, $13 million of bank and legal fees related to the ihc debt redemption and class b repurchase and $13 million for the acceleration of the amortization of ihc debt issuance cost, as discussed above.

2015 to 2014 annual comparison. our income tax provision, on a consolidated basis, amounted to an income tax expense of $2,072 million in 2015 compared to an expense of $349 million in 2014. the increased expense was primarily due to an increase in "income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures" in 2015 compared to 2014. in addition, during the fourth quarter of 2014, we changed the repatriation assertion for our japanese insurance companies with respect to post-2013 operating earnings and aoci, except realized and unrealized capital gains and losses. on march 31, 2015, the government of japan enacted an approximately two percentage points reduction in the japanese tax rate, effective april 1, 2015. our income tax provision for 2015 reflects a tax benefit from the lower japan tax rate for indefinitely reinvested earnings of our japanese insurance operations, partially offset by $75 million of additional tax expense related to the revaluation of japan's deferred tax asset. in addition, in december 2015, congress enacted legislation renewing the active financing exception ("afe"), retroactive to january 1, 2015 and making the provision a permanent part of the u.s. tax code. as a result of the change in tax law, deferred tax liabilities associated with prudential of korea's and prudential of taiwan's unrealized investment gains were reversed in the fourth quarter of 2015, and an additional tax benefit of $108 million was reflected in our income tax provision for 2015.
our income tax provision related to foreign operations, on a consolidated basis, amounted to an income tax expense of $742 million in 2015 compared to an income tax benefit of $456 million in 2014. the foreign operations income tax expense increased primarily due to the increase in foreign operations pre-tax income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures partially offset by the impact of tax rate changes in japan during 2014 and 2015.

2014 to 2013 annual comparison. our income tax provision, on a consolidated basis, amounted to an income tax expense of $349 million in 2014 compared to a benefit of $1,058 million in 2013. our income tax provision for 2014 and 2013 included $53 million and $55 million, respectively, of an additional u.s. tax expense related to the realization of a portion of the local deferred tax assets existing on the opening day balance sheet for the star and edison businesses and prudential gibraltar financial life insurance company, ltd. ("prudential gibraltar"). the local utilization of the deferred tax asset coupled with the repatriation assertion related to the applicable earnings of our japanese entities creates the effect of a "double tax" for u.s. gaap purposes, even though the tax will only be paid once. in addition, the u.s. tax expense for 2014 reflected a change in repatriation assertion for our japanese insurance companies, as described above, and as a result, foreign taxes at other than the u.s. rate for 2014 reflected the lower local country rate for permanently reinvested earnings of our japanese insurance operations. the u.s. tax expense for 2013 reflected a change in repatriation assertion for gibraltar life and prudential gibraltar. during 2013, we determined that in addition to u.s. gaap earnings, we would repatriate an additional amount from gibraltar life and prudential gibraltar, but that such additional amount would not exceed the deferred tax assets recorded in the statement of financial position as of the acquisition date for prudential gibraltar and the star and edison businesses. excluding the impact of the "double tax" and the 2014 change in repatriation assertion for our japanese insurance companies, the 2014 income tax expense increased primarily due to the increase in "income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures".
our income tax provision related to foreign operations, on a consolidated basis, amounted to an income tax benefit of $456 million in 2014 compared to an income tax benefit of $826 million in 2013. our foreign operations income tax provision for 2013 included $108 million of an additional tax expense from the re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities resulting from the japan corporate income tax rate reduction. however, since the 2013 earnings of our japanese operations were treated as being subject to repatriation, our domestic tax provision in 2013 included $108 million of an additional tax benefit resulting from the increase or decrease in the future foreign tax credit benefit and, as a result, the reduction in the japan corporate tax rate had no impact on our overall income tax provision in 2013. excluding the impact from the japan corporate income tax rate reduction, the foreign operations income tax benefit decreased primarily due to the decrease in foreign operations pre-tax loss from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures.
we employ various tax strategies, including strategies to minimize the amount of taxes resulting from realized capital gains. for additional information regarding income taxes, see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.
discontinued operations included within net income are the results of businesses that are reflected as discontinued operations under u.s. gaap. income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes, was $0 million, $12 million and $7 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
experience-rated contractholder liabilities, trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and other related investments certain products included in the retirement and international insurance segments are experience-rated in that investment results associated with these products are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. the majority of investments supporting these experience-rated products are classified as trading and are carried at fair value. these trading investments are reflected on the statements of financial position as "trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities, at fair value" ("taasil"). realized and unrealized gains (losses) for these investments are reported in "other income." interest and dividend income for these investments is reported in "net investment income." to a lesser extent, these experience-rated products are also supported by derivatives and commercial mortgage and other loans. the derivatives that support these experience-rated products are reflected on the statement of financial position as "other long-term investments" and are carried at fair value, and the realized and unrealized gains (losses) are reported in "realized investment gains (losses), net." the commercial mortgage and other loans that support these experience-rated products are carried at unpaid principal, net of unamortized discounts and an allowance for losses, and are reflected on the statements of financial position as "commercial mortgage and other loans." gains (losses) on sales and changes in the valuation allowance for commercial mortgage and other loans are reported in "realized investment gains (losses), net."
our retirement segment has two types of experience-rated products that are supported by taasil and other related investments. fully participating products are those for which the entire return on underlying investments is passed back to the policyholders through a corresponding adjustment to the related liability. the adjustment to the liability is based on changes in the fair value of all of the related assets, including commercial mortgage and other loans, which are carried at amortized cost, less any valuation allowance. partially participating products are those for which only a portion of the return on underlying investments is passed back to the policyholders over time through changes to the contractual crediting rates. the crediting rates are typically reset semiannually, often subject to a minimum crediting rate, and returns are required to be passed back within ten years.
104
in our international insurance segment, the experience-rated products are fully participating. as a result, the entire return on the underlying investments is passed back to policyholders through a corresponding adjustment to the related liability.
adjusted operating income excludes net investment gains (losses) on taasil, related derivatives and commercial mortgage and other loans. this is consistent with the exclusion of realized investment gains (losses) with respect to other investments supporting insurance liabilities managed on a consistent basis. in addition, to be consistent with the historical treatment of charges related to realized investment gains (losses) on investments, adjusted operating income also excludes the change in contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes in the pool of investments (including changes in the fair value of commercial mortgage and other loans) supporting these experience-rated contracts, which are reflected in "interest credited to policyholders' account balances." the result of this approach is that adjusted operating income for these products includes net fee revenue and interest spread we earn on these experience-rated contracts, and excludes changes in fair value of the pool of investments, both realized and unrealized, that we expect will ultimately accrue to the contractholders.
the following table sets forth the impact on results for the periods indicated of these items that are excluded from adjusted operating income:

(1)   decreases to contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes are limited by certain floors and therefore do not reflect cumulative declines in recorded asset values of $15 million, $2 million and $26 million as of december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we have recovered and expect to recover in future periods these declines in recorded asset values through subsequent increases in recorded asset values or reductions in crediting rates on contractholder liabilities.
(2)   included in the amounts above related to the change in the liability to contractholders as a result of commercial mortgage and other loans are decreases of $64 million, $1 million and $58 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. as prescribed by u.s. gaap, changes in the fair value of commercial mortgage and other loans held for investment in our general account, other than when associated with impairments, are not recognized in income in the current period, while the impact of these changes in fair value are reflected as a change in the liability to fully participating contractholders in the current period.
the net impacts for the retirement segment of changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities and investment gains (losses) on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and other related investments reflect timing differences between the recognition of the mark-to-market adjustments and the recognition of the recovery of these adjustments in future periods through subsequent increases in asset values or reductions in crediting rates on contractholder liabilities for partially participating products. these impacts also reflect the difference between the fair value of the underlying commercial mortgage and other loans and the amortized cost, less any valuation allowance, of these loans, as described above.

valuation of assets and liabilities fair value of assets and liabilities the authoritative guidance related to fair value measurement establishes a framework that includes a three-level hierarchy used to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value. the level in the hierarchy within which the fair value falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement. the fair values of assets and liabilities classified as level 3 include at least one significant unobservable input in the measurement. see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for an additional description of the valuation hierarchy levels as well as for the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by hierarchy level presented on a consolidated basis.
the table below presents the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as of the periods indicated, and the portion of such assets and liabilities that are classified in level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. the table also provides details about these assets and liabilities excluding those held in the closed block division. we believe the amounts excluding the closed block division are most relevant to an understanding of our operations that are pertinent to investors in prudential financial because substantially all closed block division assets support obligations and liabilities relating to the closed block policies only. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the closed block.

(1)   the amount of level 3 assets taken as a percentage of total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis totaled 5.8% and 5.3% as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for pfi excluding the closed block division, and 3.4% and 2.9% as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for the closed block division.
(2)   "all other" and "other liabilities" primarily include derivatives. the amounts classified as level 3 exclude the impact of netting.

the determination of fair value, which for certain assets and liabilities is dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, can have a significant impact on our results of operations and may require the application of a greater degree of judgment depending on market conditions, as the ability to value assets and liabilities can be significantly impacted by a decrease in market activity or a lack of transactions executed in an orderly manner. the following sections provide information regarding certain assets and liabilities which are valued using level 3 inputs and could have a significant impact on our results of operations.
fixed maturity and equity securities fixed maturity securities included in level 3 in our fair value hierarchy are generally priced based on internally-developed valuations or indicative broker quotes. for certain private fixed maturity and equity securities, the internally-developed valuation model uses significant unobservable inputs and, accordingly, such securities are included in level 3 in our fair value hierarchy. level 3 fixed maturity securities for pfi excluding the closed block division included approximately $4.3 billion of public fixed maturities as of december 31, 2015 with values primarily based on indicative broker quotes, and approximately $1.2 billion of private fixed maturities, with values primarily based on internally-developed models. significant unobservable inputs used included: issue specific credit adjustments, material non-public financial information, management judgment, estimation of future earnings and cash flows, default rate assumptions, liquidity assumptions and indicative quotes from market makers. these inputs are usually considered unobservable, as not all market participants have access to this data.
the impact our determination of fair value for fixed maturity and equity securities has on our results of operations is dependent on our classification of the security as either trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity. for our investments classified as trading, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded within "other income." for our investments classified as available-for-sale, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in aoci, a separate component of equity. our investments classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost.
other long-term investments other long-term investments classified in level 3 primarily include fund investments where the fair value option has been elected. these fair values are primarily determined by the fund managers. since the valuations may be based on unobservable market inputs and cannot be validated by the company, these investments are included within level 3. investments in these funds for pfi excluding the closed block division included in level 3 totaled approximately $1.0 billion as of december 31, 2015.
separate account assets separate account assets included in level 3 primarily include real estate investments. the fair value of real estate held in consolidated investment funds is determined through an independent appraisal process. the appraisals generally utilize a discounted cash flow model. the appraisals also include replacement cost estimates and recent sales data as alternate methods of fair value. these appraisals and the related assumptions are updated at least annually. since many of the assumptions utilized are unobservable and are considered to be significant inputs to the valuation, the real estate investments within separate account assets are reflected within level 3. separate account liabilities are reported at contract value and not at fair value.
variable annuity living benefit features future policy benefits classified in level 3 primarily include liabilities related to guarantees associated with the living benefit features of certain variable annuity contracts offered by our individual annuities segment, including gmab, gmwb and gmiwb. these benefits are accounted for as embedded derivatives and carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in "realized investment gains (losses), net." the fair values of the gmab, gmwb and gmiwb liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefit payments to customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature. this methodology could result in either a liability or contra-liability balance, based on capital market conditions and various policyholder behavior assumptions. since there is no observable active market for the transfer of these obligations, the valuations are calculated using internally-developed models with option pricing techniques. these models utilize significant assumptions that are primarily unobservable, including assumptions as to lapse rates, npr, utilization rates, withdrawal rates, mortality rates and equity market volatility. future policy benefits classified as level 3 for pfi excluding the closed block division were a net liability of $8.4 billion as of december 31, 2015. for additional information, see "-results of operations by segment-u.s. retirement solutions and investment management division-individual annuities."
notes issued by consolidated vies as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, notes issued by consolidated vies represent non-recourse notes issued by certain asset-backed investment vehicles, primarily collateralized loan obligations, which we are required to consolidate. we have elected the fair value option for these notes, which are valued based on broker quotes.
107
for additional information about the key estimates and assumptions used in our determination of fair value, see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
realized investment gains and losses realized investment gains and losses are generated from numerous sources, including the following significant items:
•   sale of investments;
•   maturities of foreign denominated investments;
•   adjustments to the cost basis of investments for otti;
•   recognition of otti in earnings for foreign denominated securities that are approaching maturity and are in an unrealized loss position due to foreign currency exchange rate movements;
•   prepayment premiums received on private fixed maturity securities;
•   net changes in the allowance for losses, certain restructurings and foreclosures on commercial mortgage and other loans; and
•   fair value changes on embedded derivatives and free-standing derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
the level of otti generally reflects economic conditions and is expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and to decrease when economic conditions improve. historically, the causes of otti have been specific to each individual issuer and have not directly resulted in impairments to other securities within the same industry or geographic region. we may also realize additional credit and interest rate related losses through sales of investments pursuant to our credit risk and portfolio management objectives. for additional information regarding our policies regarding otti for fixed maturity and equity securities, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
we use interest rate and currency swaps and other derivatives to manage interest and currency exchange rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities, including duration mismatches. we use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk that unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates will materially affect u.s. dollar-equivalent earnings generated by certain of our non-u.s. businesses. we also use equity-based and interest rate derivatives to hedge a portion of the risks embedded in certain variable annuity products with optional living benefit guarantees. many of these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and, consequently, we recognize the changes in fair value of such contracts from period to period in current earnings, although we do not necessarily account for the related assets or liabilities the same way.
accordingly, realized investment gains and losses from our derivative activities can contribute significantly to fluctuations in net income. for a further discussion of optional living benefit guarantees and related hedge positions in our individual annuities segment, see "-results of operations by segment-u.s. retirement solutions and investment management division-individual annuities" above.
adjusted operating income generally excludes "realized investment gains (losses), net," subject to certain exceptions. these exceptions primarily include realized investment gains or losses within certain of our businesses for which such gains or losses are a principal source of earnings, gains or losses associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments, and related charges and adjustments. otti, interest rate related losses and credit related losses on sales (other than those related to certain of our businesses which primarily originate investments for sale or syndication to unrelated investors) are excluded from adjusted operating income.
the following table sets forth "realized investment gains (losses), net," by investment type as well as related charges and adjustments for the periods indicated. for additional details regarding adjusted operating income, see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.

net gains on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities were $1,456 million in 2015 primarily due to net gains of $511 million on sales and maturities of u.s. dollar-denominated securities within our international insurance segment, and gains of $852 million associated with foreign exchange remeasurement on assets that were transferred under the new structure in gibraltar life and will be recognized in earnings over time as these assets mature or are sold. see "-results of operations by segment-international insurance division" above. these gains were partially offset by otti of $97 million. net gains on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities of $736 million in 2014 were primarily due to sales and maturities of u.s. dollar-denominated securities within our international insurance segment. these gains were partially offset by otti of $36 million. see below for information regarding the otti of fixed maturity securities in 2015 and 2014.
net realized gains on equity securities were $4 million and $81 million for the years ended 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily driven by gains on sales within our international insurance segment. these gains were partially offset by otti of $111 million and $26 million for the years ended 2015 and 2014, respectively. see below for additional information regarding the otti of equity securities in 2015 and 2014.
net realized gains on commercial mortgage and other loans for the year ended 2015 were $36 million, primarily driven by servicing revenue of $31 million in our asset management business and a net decrease in the allowance for losses of $5 million. net realized gains on commercial mortgage and other loans were $79 million for the year ended 2014 were primarily driven by a net decrease in the allowance for losses of $65 million, including the impact of assumption updates. for additional information regarding our commercial mortgage and other allowance for losses, see "-general account investments-commercial mortgage and other loans-commercial mortgage and other loan quality" below.
net realized gains on derivatives were $1,775 million in 2015, compared to net realized losses of $445 million in 2014. the net gains in 2015 primarily reflect $995 million of gains on product related embedded derivatives and related hedge positions mainly associated with certain variable annuity contracts, $326 million of gains on interest rate derivatives used to manage duration as interest rates decreased, $345 million of gains on foreign currency derivatives used to hedge foreign denominated investments as the u.s. dollar strengthened against various currencies, and $159 million of gains primarily representing fees earned on fee-based synthetic guaranteed investment contracts ("gics") which are accounted for as derivatives. the net derivative losses in 2014 primarily reflect net losses of $2,627 million on product related embedded derivatives and related hedge positions mainly associated with certain variable annuity contracts. also, contributing were net losses of $500 million on foreign currency derivatives used to hedge portfolio assets in our japan business, primarily due to the weakening of the japanese yen against the u.s. dollar and other currencies. these losses were partially offset by gains of $1,502 million on interest rate derivatives used to manage duration as long-term interest rates decreased, $869 million gains on other foreign currency derivatives primarily associated with hedges of portfolio assets in our u.s. business and hedges of future income of non-u.s. businesses (predominantly in japan) as the u.s. dollar strengthened against various currencies, and $166 million gains of fees earned on fee-based synthetic gics.

net realized losses within other investments were $54 million in 2015 primarily driven by otti of $121 million on investments in limited partnerships, partially offset by gains of $40 million, on sales of real estate. net realized gains on other investments were $7 million in 2014 and included net gains of $28 million, primarily from our asset management and international insurance segments, partially offset by otti of $21 million on real estate and joint ventures and partnership investments.
related adjustments include the portions of "realized investment gains (losses), net" that are included in adjusted operating income and the portions of "other income" and "net investment income" that are excluded from adjusted operating income. these adjustments are made to arrive at "realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments" which are excluded from adjusted operating income. results for 2015 include net negative related adjustments of $934 million driven by settlements on interest rate and currency derivatives. results for 2014 included net negative related adjustments of $4,063 million driven by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on certain non-yen denominated assets and liabilities within our japan insurance operations and by settlements on interest rate and currency derivatives. we implemented a structure in gibraltar life, effective for financial reporting beginning in the first quarter of 2015, which has minimized volatility in reported u.s. gaap earnings arising from foreign currency remeasurement. for additional information, see "-results of operations by segment-international insurance division" above.
charges that relate to "realized investment gains (losses), net" are also excluded from adjusted operating income, and may be reflected as net charges or net benefits. results for 2015 include net related charges of $679 million, compared to net related charges of $542 million in 2014. both periods' results were driven by the impact of derivative activity on the amortization of dac and other costs and certain policyholder reserves. for additional information, see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.
during 2015, we recorded otti of $329 million in earnings, compared to $83 million in 2014. the following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the composition of otti recorded in earnings attributable to the pfi excluding the closed block division by asset type, and for fixed maturity securities, by reason.

net gains on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities of $736 million in 2014 were primarily due to sales and maturities of u.s. dollar-denominated securities within our international insurance segment. net losses on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities of $98 million in 2013 were primarily driven by losses on sales of securities due to changes in interest rates subsequent to the acquisition of securities that were sold, partially offset by gains on sales within our international insurance segment initiated for purposes of duration management as well as from surrenders of fixed annuities denominated in australian and u.s. dollars. see below for additional information regarding the otti of fixed maturity securities in 2014 and 2013.
net realized gains on equity securities were $81 million and $130 million for the years ended 2014 and 2013, respectively, driven by gains on sales, primarily within our international insurance segment, of $107 million and $142 million, respectively. these gains were partially offset by otti of $26 million and $12 million for the years ended 2014 and 2013, respectively. see below for additional information regarding the otti of equity securities in 2014 and 2013.
net realized gains on commercial mortgage and other loans for the year ended 2014 were $79 million, primarily driven by a net decrease in the allowance for losses of $65 million, including the impact of assumption updates. net realized gains on commercial mortgage and other loans were $72 million for the year ended in 2013, were primarily driven by a net decrease in the allowance for losses of $38 million, mostly driven by payoffs and quality rating upgrades. for additional information regarding our commercial mortgage and other allowance for losses, see "-general account investments-commercial mortgage and other loans-commercial mortgage and other loan quality" below.
net realized losses on derivatives were $445 million in 2014, compared to net realized losses of $5,488 million in 2013. the net derivative losses in 2014 primarily reflect net losses of $2,627 million on product related embedded derivatives and related hedge positions mainly associated with certain variable annuity contracts. also contributing were net losses of $500 million on foreign currency derivatives used to hedge portfolio assets in our japan business, primarily due to the weakening of the japanese yen against the u.s. dollar and other currencies. these losses were partially offset by gains of $1,502 million on interest rate derivatives used to manage duration as long-term interest rates decreased; $869 million gains on other foreign currency derivatives primarily associated with hedges of portfolio assets in our u.s. business and hedges of future income of non-u.s. businesses (predominantly in japan) as the u.s. dollar strengthened against various currencies; and $166 million gains of fees earned on fee-based synthetic gics which are accounted for as derivatives. the net derivative losses in 2013 primarily reflect net losses of $4,195 million on product related embedded derivatives and related hedge positions mainly associated with certain variable annuity contracts as well as net mark-to-market losses of $987 million on interest rate derivatives used to manage duration as long-term interest rates increased. also contributing were net losses $794 million on foreign currency derivatives used to hedge portfolio assets in our japan business, primarily due to the weakening of the japanese yen against the u.s. dollar and other currencies. partially offsetting these losses were net gains of $472 million on foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge the future income of non-u.s. businesses, predominantly in japan, due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the japanese yen.

net realized gains on other investments were $7 million in 2014 and included net gains of $28 million, primarily from our asset management and international insurance segments, partially offset by otti of $21 million on real estate and joint ventures and partnership investments. net realized gains on other investments were $61 million in 2013 and included net gains of $73 million, primarily within our corporate and other segment, partially offset by otti of $12 million on real estate and joint ventures and partnership investments.
related adjustments for 2014 included net negative related adjustments of $4,063 million, compared to net negative related adjustments of $4,518 million for 2013. results for both periods were driven by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on certain non-yen denominated assets and liabilities within our japanese insurance operations, as discussed above, and by settlements on interest rate and currency derivatives.
related charges for 2014 included net related charges of $542 million, compared to net related benefits of $1,807 million in 2013. both periods' results were driven by the impact of derivative activity on the amortization of dac and other costs and certain policyholder reserves.

(1)   excludes the portion of otti recorded in "other comprehensive income (loss)," representing any difference between the fair value of the impaired debt security and the net present value of its projected future cash flows at the time of impairment.
(2)   represents circumstances where we believe credit events or other adverse conditions of the respective issuers have caused, or will lead to, a deficiency in the contractual cash flows related to the investment. the amount of the impairment recorded in earnings is the difference between the amortized cost of the debt security and the net present value of its projected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate implicit in the debt security prior to impairment.
(3)   primarily represents circumstances where securities with losses from foreign currency exchange rate movements approach maturity.
fixed maturity security otti in 2014 were concentrated in the utility, consumer cyclical, and finance sectors within corporate securities. these otti were primarily related to intent to sell securities, or related to securities with liquidity concerns, downgrades in credit, bankruptcy or other adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers. fixed maturity security otti in 2013 were concentrated in asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, and in the utility, communications, and consumer non-cyclical sectors within corporate securities. these otti were primarily related to securities with liquidity concerns, downgrades in credit, bankruptcy or other adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers.

net realized gains on equity securities were $431 million and $314 million for the years ended 2014 and 2013, respectively, and included net gains on sales of equity securities of $437 million and $317 million, respectively, partially offset by otti-impairments of $6 million and $3 million, respectively. see below for additional information regarding the otti of equity securities in 2014 and 2013.
net realized gains on commercial mortgage and other loans for the year ended 2014 were $31 million, primarily driven by a net decrease in the allowance for losses of $32 million, including the impact of assumption updates. net realized gains on commercial mortgage and other loans were $7 million for the year ended 2013, primarily related to a net decrease in the allowance for losses. for additional information regarding our allowance for losses, see "-general account investments-commercial mortgage and other loans-commercial mortgage and other loan quality" below.
net realized gains on derivatives were $263 million in 2014, compared to net realized losses of $200 million in 2013. derivative gains in 2014 primarily reflect net gains of $182 million on currency derivatives used to hedge foreign denominated investments as the u.s. dollar strengthened against the euro; net gains of $72 million on interest rate derivatives primarily used to manage duration as long term interest rates decreased; and net gains of $45 million on tba forward contracts as interest rates declined. these gains are partially offset by losses of $41 million on terminated capital cash flow hedges due to debt extinguishment. derivative losses in 2013 primarily reflect net losses of $106 million on interest rate derivatives primarily used to manage duration as long term interest rates increased as well as losses of $74 million on currency derivatives used to hedge foreign denominated investments as the u.s. dollar weakened against the euro.
during 2014, we recorded otti of $31 million in earnings, compared to otti of $62 million in 2013. the following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the composition of otti recorded in earnings attributable to the closed block division by asset type, and for fixed maturity securities, by reason.

general account investments we maintain diversified investment portfolios in our general account to support our liabilities to customers as well as our other general liabilities. our general account does not include: (1) assets of our derivative operations; (2) assets of our asset management operations, including assets managed for third parties; and (3) those assets classified as "separate account assets" on our balance sheet.
the general account portfolios are managed pursuant to the distinct objectives and investment policy statements of pfi excluding the closed block division and the closed block division. the primary investment objectives of pfi excluding the closed block division include:
•   hedging the market risk characteristics of the major product liabilities and other obligations of the company;
•   optimizing investment income yield within risk constraints over time; and
•   for certain portfolios, optimizing total return, including both investment income yield and capital appreciation, within risk constraints over time, while managing the market risk exposures associated with the corresponding product liabilities.
117
we pursue our objective to optimize investment income yield for pfi excluding the closed block division over time through: (1) the investment of net operating cash flow, including new product premium inflows, and proceeds from investment sales, repayments and prepayments, into investments with attractive risk-adjusted yields, and (2) where appropriate, the sale of lower-yielding investments, either to meet various cash flow needs or to manage the portfolio's risk exposure profile with respect to duration, credit, currency and other risk factors, while considering the impact on taxes and capital.
the primary investment objectives of the closed block division include:
•   providing for the reasonable dividend expectations of the participating policyholders within the closed block division; and
•   optimizing total return, including both investment income yield and capital appreciation, within risk constraints, while managing the market risk exposures associated with the major products in the closed block division.
our portfolio management approach, while emphasizing our investment income yield and asset/liability risk management objectives, also takes into account the capital and tax implications of portfolio activity, our assertions regarding our ability and intent to hold equity securities to recovery, and our lack of any intention or requirement to sell debt securities before anticipated recovery. for a further discussion of our policies regarding other-than-temporary impairments, including our assertions regarding our ability and intent to hold equity securities to recovery and any intention or requirement to sell debt securities before anticipated recovery, see "-fixed maturity securities-other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities" and "-equity securities-other-than-temporary impairments of equity securities," below.
management of investments the investment committee of our board of directors oversees our proprietary investments, including our general account portfolios. it also regularly reviews performance and risk positions. our chief investment officer organization ("cio organization") works with our risk management group to develop the investment policies for the general account portfolios of our domestic and international insurance subsidiaries, and directs and oversees management of the general account portfolios within risk limits and exposure ranges approved annually by the investment committee.
the cio organization, including related functions within our insurance subsidiaries, works closely with product actuaries and risk management to understand the characteristics of our products and their associated market risk exposures. this information is incorporated into the development of target asset portfolios that hedge market risk exposures associated with the liability characteristics and establish investment risk exposures, within tolerances prescribed by prudential's investment risk limits, on which we expect to earn an attractive risk-adjusted return. we develop asset strategies for specific classes of product liabilities and attributed or accumulated surplus, each with distinct risk characteristics. market risk exposures associated with the liabilities include interest rate risk which is addressed through the duration characteristics of the target asset mix, and currency risk which is addressed by the currency profile of the target asset mix. in certain of our smaller markets, outside of the u.s. and japan, capital markets limitations hinder our ability to hedge interest rate exposure to the same extent we do for our u.s. and japan businesses and lead us to accept a higher degree of interest rate risk in these smaller portfolios. general account portfolios typically include allocations to credit and other investment risks as a means to enhance investment yields and returns over time.
most of our products can be categorized into the following three classes:
•   interest-crediting products for which the rates credited to customers are periodically adjusted to reflect market and competitive forces and actual investment experience, such as fixed annuities and universal life insurance;
•   participating individual and experience-rated group products in which customers participate in actual investment and business results through annual dividends, interest or return of premium; and
•   products with fixed or guaranteed terms, such as traditional whole life and endowment products, guaranteed investment contracts, funding agreements and payout annuities.
our total investment portfolio is composed of a number of operating portfolios. each operating portfolio backs a specific set of liabilities and the portfolios have a target asset mix that supports the liability characteristics, including duration, cash flow, liquidity needs and other criteria. as of december 31, 2015, the average duration of our domestic general account investment portfolios attributable to pfi excluding the closed block division, including the impact of derivatives, is between 6 and 7 years. as of december 31, 2015, the average duration of our international general account portfolios attributable to our japanese insurance operations, including the impact of derivatives, is between 10 and 11 years, and represents a blend of yen-denominated and u.s. and australian dollar-denominated investments, which have distinct average durations. our asset/liability management process has enabled us to manage our portfolios through several market cycles.
118
we implement our portfolio strategies primarily through investment in a broad range of fixed income assets, including government and agency securities, public and private corporate bonds and structured securities, and commercial mortgage loans. in addition, we hold allocations of non-coupon investments, which include equity securities and other long-term investments such as joint ventures and limited partnerships, real estate held through direct ownership, and seed money investments in separate accounts.
we manage our public fixed maturity portfolio to a risk profile directed or overseen by the cio organization and risk management groups and to a profile that also reflects the local market environments impacting both our domestic and international insurance portfolios. the return that we earn on the portfolio will be reflected both as investment income and also as realized gains or losses on investments.
we use privately-placed corporate debt securities and commercial mortgage loans, which consist of mortgages on diversified properties in terms of geography, property type and borrowers, to enhance the yield on our portfolio and to improve the overall diversification of the portfolios. private placements typically offer enhanced yields due to an illiquidity premium and generally offer enhanced credit protection in the form of covenants. our origination capability offers the opportunity to lead transactions and gives us the opportunity for better terms, including covenants and call protection, and to take advantage of innovative deal structures.
derivative strategies are employed in the context of our risk management framework to enhance our ability to manage interest rate and currency risk exposures of the asset portfolio relative to the liabilities and to manage credit and equity positions in the investment portfolios. for a discussion of our risk management process, see "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" below.
our portfolio asset allocation reflects our emphasis on diversification across asset classes, sectors, and issuers. the cio organization, directly and through related functions within the insurance subsidiaries, implements portfolio strategies primarily through various asset management units within prudential's asset management segment. activities of the asset management segment on behalf of the general account portfolios are directed and overseen by the cio organization and monitored by risk management for compliance with investment risk limits.
portfolio composition our investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans, policy loans, and non-coupon investments as defined above. the composition of our general account reflects, within the discipline provided by our risk management approach, our need for competitive results and the selection of diverse investment alternatives available primarily through our asset management segment. the size of our portfolio enables us to invest in asset classes that may be unavailable to the typical investor.
the following tables set forth the composition of the investments of our general account apportioned between pfi excluding the closed block division and the closed block division as of the dates indicated.

the increase in general account investments attributable to pfi excluding the closed block division in 2015 was primarily due to the reinvestment of net investment income and the transfer of assets from the former closed block business partially offset by the translation impact of the australian dollar and yen weakening against the u.s. dollar, a net decrease in fair value driven by an increase in interest rates in the u.s. and credit spread widening, and net business outflows. the general account investments attributable to the closed block division decreased in 2015, primarily due to the transfer of assets related to the former closed block business and a net decrease in fair value driven by an increase in interest rates in the u.s. and credit spread widening. for information regarding the methodology used in determining the fair value of our fixed maturities, see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
as of both december 31, 2015 and 2014, 41% of our general account investments attributable to pfi excluding the closed block division related to our japanese insurance operations.
although the majority of the japanese general account is invested in yen-denominated investments, our japanese insurance operations also hold significant investments denominated in u.s. and australian dollars, including those that support liabilities denominated in these currencies. as a result of continued growth in these portfolios, we have implemented a new reporting structure in gibraltar life that disaggregates the u.s. and australian dollar-denominated businesses into separate divisions, each with its own functional currency that aligns with the underlying products and investments. the new structure was effective for financial reporting beginning in the first quarter of 2015. for additional information, see "-results of operations by segment-international insurance division," above.
the following table sets forth the composition related to the investments of our japanese insurance operations' general account as of the dates indicated.

the decrease in general account investments related to our japanese insurance operations in 2015 was primarily attributable to the translation impact of the australian dollar and the yen weakening against the u.s. dollar, a net decrease in fair value driven by credit spread widening and an increase in u.s. interest rates.
as of december 31, 2015, our japanese insurance operations had $50.2 billion, at fair value, of investments denominated in u.s. dollars, including $4.0 billion that were hedged to yen through third-party derivative contracts and $32.3 billion that support liabilities denominated in u.s. dollars, with the remainder hedging our foreign currency exchange rate exposure on u.s. dollar-equivalent equity. as of december 31, 2014, our japanese insurance operations had $48.9 billion, at fair value, of investments denominated in u.s. dollars, including $3.6 billion that were hedged to yen through third-party derivative contracts and $31.9 billion that support liabilities denominated in u.s. dollars, with the remainder hedging our foreign currency exchange rate exposure on u.s. dollar-equivalent equity. the $1.3 billion increase in the fair value of u.s. dollar-denominated investments from december 31, 2014, is primarily attributable to portfolio growth as a result of business inflows and the reinvestment of net investment income, partially offset by a net decrease in fair value driven by credit spread widening and an increase in u.s. interest rates.

our japanese insurance operations had $10.0 billion and $10.4 billion, at fair value, of investments denominated in australian dollars that support liabilities denominated in australian dollars as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the $0.4 billion decrease in the fair value of australian dollar-denominated investments from december 31, 2014, is primarily attributable to the translation impact of the australian dollar weakening against the u.s. dollar, partially offset by portfolio growth as a result of business inflows and the reinvestment of net investment income.

see below for a discussion of the change in the yields for pfi excluding the closed block division. the net investment income yield attributable to the closed block division for 2015 decreased compared to 2014, due to lower income on non-coupon investments and lower fixed income reinvestment rates.
the net investment income yield attributable to the closed block division for 2014 remained relatively flat compared to 2013, as higher income from non-coupon investments was mostly offset by lower fixed income reinvestment rates.
the following table sets forth the income yield and investment income for each major investment category of our general account investments, excluding both the closed block division and the japanese insurance operations' portion of the general account which is presented separately below, for the periods indicated. the yields are based on net investment income as reported under u.s. gaap and as such do not include certain interest related items, such as settlements of duration management swaps which are included in realized gains (losses).

the increase in net investment income yield on the japanese insurance portfolio for 2015, compared to 2014, was primarily attributable to a higher allocation into u.s. dollar-denominated investments.
the increase in net investment income yield on the japanese insurance portfolio for 2014, compared to 2013, was primarily attributable to a higher allocation into u.s. dollar-denominated securities and higher income from non-coupon investments.
both the u.s. dollar-denominated and australian dollar-denominated fixed maturities that are not hedged to yen through third-party derivative contracts provide a yield that is substantially higher than the yield on comparable yen-denominated fixed maturities. the average amortized cost of u.s. dollar-denominated fixed maturities that are not hedged to yen through third-party derivative contracts was approximately $35.0 billion and $33.9 billion, for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the majority of u.s. dollar-denominated fixed maturities support liabilities that are denominated in u.s. dollars. the average amortized cost of australian dollar-denominated fixed maturities that are not hedged to yen through third-party derivative contracts was approximately $9.3 billion and $8.9 billion, for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the australian dollar-denominated fixed maturities support liabilities that are denominated in australian dollars.

the tables above provide ratings as assigned by nationally recognized rating agencies as of december 31, 2015, including standard & poor's, moody's and fitch. in making our investment decisions, rather than relying solely on the rating agencies' evaluations, we assign internal ratings to our asset-backed securities based upon our dedicated asset-backed securities unit's independent evaluation of the underlying collateral and securitization structure, including any guarantees from monoline bond insurers.
while there is no market standard definition for securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, we define sub-prime mortgages as residential mortgages that are originated to weaker-quality obligors as indicated by weaker credit scores, as well as mortgages with higher loan-to-value ratios or limited documentation.
on an amortized cost basis, asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages attributable to pfi excluding the closed block division decreased from $1.627 billion as of december 31, 2014, to $1.141 billion as of december 31, 2015, primarily reflecting sales and principal paydowns. gross unrealized losses related to our asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages were $34 million as of december 31, 2015, and $55 million as of december 31, 2014. for information regarding the methodology used in determining the fair value of our asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.

fixed maturity securities credit quality the securities valuation office ("svo") of the national association of insurance commissioners ("naic"), evaluates the investments of insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called "naic designations." in general, naic designations of "1" highest quality, or "2" high quality, include fixed maturities considered investment grade, which include securities rated baa3 or higher by moody's or bbb- or higher by standard & poor's. naic designations of "3" through "6" generally include fixed maturities referred to as below investment grade, which include securities rated ba1 or lower by moody's and bb+ or lower by standard & poor's. the naic designations for commercial mortgage-backed securities and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, including our asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, are based on security level expected losses as modeled by an independent third-party (engaged by the naic) and the statutory carrying value of the security, including any purchase discounts or impairment charges previously recognized.
as a result of time lags between the funding of investments, the finalization of legal documents, and the completion of the svo filing process, the fixed maturity portfolio generally includes securities that have not yet been designated by the svo as of each balance sheet date. pending receipt of svo designations, the categorization of these securities by naic designation is based on the expected ratings indicated by internal analysis.
investments of our international insurance companies are not subject to naic guidelines. investments of our japanese insurance operations are regulated locally by the financial services agency, an agency of the japanese government. the financial services agency has its own investment quality criteria and risk control standards. our japanese insurance companies comply with the financial services agency's credit quality review and risk monitoring guidelines. the credit quality ratings of the investments of our japanese insurance companies are based on ratings assigned by nationally recognized credit rating agencies, including moody's, standard & poor's, or rating equivalents based on ratings assigned by japanese credit ratings agencies.
the following table sets forth our fixed maturity portfolio by naic designation or equivalent ratings attributable to pfi excluding the closed block division as of the dates indicated.

credit derivative exposure to public fixed maturities in addition to the credit exposure from public fixed maturities noted above, we sell credit derivatives to enhance the return on our investment portfolio by creating credit exposure similar to an investment in public fixed maturity cash instruments.
in a credit derivative, we may sell credit protection on an identified name or a broad based index, and in return receive a quarterly premium. the majority of the underlying reference names in single name and index credit derivatives where we have sold credit protection, as well as all the counterparties to these agreements, are investment grade credit quality and our credit derivatives have a remaining term to maturity of forty-two years or less. the premium or credit spread generally corresponds to the difference between the yield on the reference name's (or index's underlying reference names) public fixed maturity cash instruments and swap rates at the time the agreement is executed. credit derivative contracts are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value, including the premiums received, recorded in "realized investment gains (losses), net."
as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, pfi excluding the closed block division had $807 million and $1.5 billion of notional amounts of exposure where we have sold credit protection through credit derivatives, reported at fair value as a liability of $27 million and $2 million, respectively. "realized investment gains (losses), net" from credit derivatives we sold was a gain of $6 million and $3 million for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. this excludes a credit derivative related to surplus notes issued by a subsidiary of prudential insurance. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this derivative.
in addition to selling credit protection, we have purchased credit protection using credit derivatives in order to hedge specific credit exposures in our investment portfolio. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, pfi excluding the closed block division had $409 million and $405 million of notional amounts reported at fair value as a liability of $4 million and $11 million, respectively. "realized investment gains (losses), net" from credit derivatives we purchased was a loss of $9 million and $22 million for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding credit derivatives and an overall description of our derivative activities.

otti of fixed maturity securities we maintain separate monitoring processes for public and private fixed maturities and create watch lists to highlight securities that require special scrutiny and management. our public fixed maturity asset managers formally review all public fixed maturity holdings on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades, unexpected price variances, and/or company or industry specific concerns.
for private placements, our credit and portfolio management processes help ensure prudent controls over valuation and management. we have separate pricing and authorization processes to establish "checks and balances" for new investments. we apply consistent standards of credit analysis and due diligence for all transactions, whether they originate through our own in-house origination staff or through agents. our regional offices closely monitor the portfolios in their regions. we set all valuation standards centrally, and we assess the fair value of all investments quarterly. our private fixed maturity asset managers formally review all private fixed maturity holdings on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades, unexpected price variances, and/or company or industry specific concerns. for additional information regarding our policies regarding otti for fixed maturity securities, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios are measures commonly used to assess the quality of commercial and agricultural mortgage loans. the loan-to-value ratio compares the amount of the loan to the fair value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan, and is commonly expressed as a percentage. loan-to-value ratios greater than 100% indicate that the loan amount is greater than the collateral value. a smaller loan-to-value ratio indicates a greater excess of collateral value over the loan amount. the debt service coverage ratio compares a property's net operating income to its debt service payments. debt service coverage ratios less than 1.0 times indicate that property operations do not generate enough income to cover the loan's current debt payments. a larger debt service coverage ratio indicates a greater excess of net operating income over the debt service payments.
as of december 31, 2015, our general account investments in commercial and agricultural mortgage loans attributable to pfi excluding the closed block division had a weighted average debt service coverage ratio of 2.45 times, and a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 57%. as of december 31, 2015, approximately 96% of commercial and agricultural mortgage loans were fixed rate loans. for those general account commercial and agricultural mortgage loans that were originated in 2015, the weighted average debt service coverage ratio was 2.58 times and the weighted average loan-to-value ratio was 65%.

the values utilized in calculating these loan-to-value ratios are developed as part of our periodic review of the commercial and agricultural mortgage loan portfolio, which includes an internal evaluation of the underlying collateral value. our periodic review also includes a quality re-rating process, whereby we update the internal quality rating originally assigned at underwriting based on the proprietary quality rating system mentioned above. as discussed below, the internal quality rating is a key input in determining our allowance for loan losses.
for loans with collateral under construction, renovation or lease-up, a stabilized value and projected net operating income are used in the calculation of the loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios. our commercial and agricultural mortgage loan portfolio included approximately $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion of such loans as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. all else being equal, these loans are inherently more risky than those collateralized by properties that have already stabilized. as of december 31, 2015, there are no loan-specific reserves related to these loans. in addition, these unstabilized loans are included in the calculation of our portfolio reserve as discussed below. for information regarding similar loans we hold as part of our commercial and agricultural mortgage operations, see "-invested assets of other entities and operations" below.
the following tables set forth the gross carrying value of our general account investments in commercial and agricultural mortgage loans attributable to pfi excluding the closed block division as of the dates indicated by loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios.

commercial mortgage and other loan quality ongoing review of the portfolio is performed and loans are placed on watch list status based on a predefined set of criteria, where they are assigned to one of the following categories. we place loans on early warning status in cases where, based on our analysis of the loan's collateral, the financial situation of the borrower or tenants or other market factors, we believe a loss of principal or interest could occur. we classify loans as closely monitored when we determine there is a collateral deficiency or other credit events that may lead to a potential loss of principal or interest. loans not in good standing are those loans where we have concluded that there is a high probability of loss of principal, such as when the loan is in the process of foreclosure or the borrower is in bankruptcy. our workout and special servicing professionals manage the loans on the watch list. as described below, in determining our allowance for losses we evaluate each loan on the watch list to determine if it is probable that amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected.
we establish an allowance for losses to provide for the risk of credit losses inherent in the lending process. the allowance includes loan specific reserves for loans that are determined to be impaired as a result of our loan review process, and a portfolio reserve for probable incurred but not specifically identified losses for loans which are not on the watch list. we define an impaired loan as a loan for which we estimate it is probable that amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected. the loan specific portion of the loss allowance is based on our assessment as to ultimate collectability of loan principal and interest. valuation allowances for an impaired loan are recorded based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or based on the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. the portfolio reserve for incurred but not specifically identified losses considers the current credit composition of the portfolio based on the internal quality ratings mentioned above. the portfolio reserves are determined using past loan experience, including historical credit migration, loss probability, and loss severity factors by property type. these factors are reviewed and updated as appropriate. the valuation allowance for commercial mortgage and other loans can increase or decrease from period to period based on these factors.
our general account investments in commercial mortgage and other loans attributable to pfi excluding the closed block division, based upon the recorded investment gross of allowance for credit losses, was $40,581 million and $36,637 million as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. as a percentage of recorded investment gross of allowance, more than 99% of these assets were current as of both december 31, 2015 and 2014.

other trading account assets other trading account assets are primarily related to assets associated with consolidated variable interest entities for which the company is the investment manager, as well as our derivative operations used to manage interest rate, foreign currency, credit and equity exposures. the assets of the consolidated variable interest entities are generally offset by liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected. for further information on these consolidated variable interest entities, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
commercial mortgage and other loans our asset management operations include our commercial mortgage operations, which provide mortgage origination, asset management and servicing for our general account, institutional clients, and government sponsored entities such as fannie mae, the federal housing administration, and freddie mac.
the mortgage loans of our commercial mortgage operations are included in "commercial mortgage and other loans," with related derivatives and other hedging instruments primarily included in "other trading account assets" and "other long-term investments."
other long-term investments other long-term investments primarily include strategic investments made as part of our asset management operations. we make these strategic investments in real estate, as well as fixed income, public equity and real estate securities, including controlling interests. certain of these investments are made primarily for purposes of co-investment in our managed funds and structured products. other strategic investments are made with the intention to sell or syndicate to investors, including our general account, or for placement in funds and structured products that we offer and manage (seed investments). as part of our asset management operations, we also make loans to our managed funds that are secured by equity commitments from investors or assets of the funds. other long-term investments also include certain assets in consolidated investment funds where the company is deemed to exercise control over the funds.
liquidity and capital resources overview liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet the payment obligations of the company. capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operations of our businesses, fund business growth, and provide a cushion to withstand adverse circumstances. our ability to generate and maintain sufficient liquidity and capital depends on the profitability of our businesses, general economic conditions and our access to the capital markets and the alternate sources of liquidity and capital described herein.
effective and prudent liquidity and capital management is a priority across the organization. management monitors the liquidity of prudential financial and its subsidiaries on a daily basis and projects borrowing and capital needs over a multi-year time horizon through our periodic planning process. we believe that cash flows from the sources of funds available to us are sufficient to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of prudential financial and its subsidiaries, including under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios. we have a capital management framework in place that governs the allocation of capital and approval of capital uses. we also employ a capital protection framework to ensure the availability of capital resources to maintain adequate capitalization on a consolidated basis and competitive risk-based capital ("rbc") ratios and solvency margins for our insurance subsidiaries under various stress scenarios.
prudential financial is a designated financial company under dodd-frank. as a designated financial company, prudential financial is subject to supervision and examination by the federal reserve bank of boston and to stricter prudential regulatory standards, which include or will include requirements and limitations (many of which are the subject of ongoing rule-making) relating to capital, leverage, liquidity, stress-testing, overall risk management, resolution and recovery plans, credit exposure reporting, early remediation, management interlocks and credit concentration. they may also include additional standards regarding enhanced public disclosure, short-term debt limits and other related subjects. in addition, the fsb has identified the company as a g-sii. for information on these recent actions and their potential impact on us, see "business-regulation" and "risk factors".

during 2015, we took the following significant actions that impacted our liquidity and capital position:
•   on january 2, 2015, we repurchased and canceled all of the outstanding shares of our class b stock for a cash purchase price of $651 million. in accordance with the terms of the class b stock repurchase agreement, the holders of a majority of the class b stock have exercised their right to dispute the calculation of the purchase price. as a result of this dispute, the final purchase price of the class b stock is expected to change;
•   we repurchased $1 billion of shares of our common stock and declared aggregate common stock dividends of $1.1 billion;
•   we issued $1.0 billion of junior subordinated notes to be utilized for general corporate purposes;
•   we obtained additional financing for guideline axxx reserves by increasing the amount outstanding under our captive financing facilities by $262 million;
•   we restructured the terms of an existing $3.0 billion captive financing facility for regulation xxx reserves by converting $600 million of outstanding debt into a credit-linked note structure; and
•   we obtained additional financing for regulation xxx reserves by increasing the amount outstanding under a captive financing facility by $665 million. an additional $300 million of subordinated surplus notes with an affiliate was paid down under a separate financing facility.
capital our capital management framework is primarily based on statutory rbc and solvency margin measures. due to our diverse mix of businesses and applicable regulatory requirements, we apply certain refinements to the framework that are designed to more appropriately reflect risks associated with our businesses on a consistent basis across the company.
we seek to capitalize all of our subsidiaries and businesses in accordance with their ratings targets, and we believe prudential financial's capitalization and use of financial leverage are consistent with those ratings targets. our long-term senior debt rating targets for prudential financial are "a" for standard & poor's rating services, or s&p, moody's investors service, inc., or moody's, and fitch ratings ltd., or fitch, and "a" for a.m. best company, or a.m. best. our financial strength rating targets for our life insurance companies are "aa/aa/aa" for s&p, moody's and fitch, respectively, and "a+" for a.m. best. some entities may currently be rated below these targets, and not all of our life insurance companies are rated by each of these rating agencies. see "-ratings" below for a description of the potential impacts of ratings downgrades.
capital governance our capital management framework is ultimately reviewed and approved by our board of directors (the "board"). the board has adopted a capital policy that authorizes our chairman and chief executive officer and vice chairman to approve certain capital actions on behalf of the company and to further delegate authority with respect to capital actions to appropriate officers. any capital commitment that exceeds the authority granted to senior management under the capital policy is separately authorized by the board.
in addition, our capital and finance committee ("cfc") reviews the use and allocation of capital above certain threshold amounts to promote the efficient use of capital, consistent with our strategic objectives, ratings aspirations and other goals and targets. this management committee provides a multi-disciplinary due diligence review of specific initiatives or transactions requiring the use of capital, including mergers and acquisitions. the cfc also evaluates our annual capital and financing plan (and updates to this plan), as well as our capital, liquidity and financial position, borrowing plans, and related matters prior to the discussion of these items with the board.
capitalization the primary components of the company's capitalization consist of equity and outstanding capital debt, including junior subordinated debt. as shown in the table below, as of december 31, 2015, the company had $41.6 billion in capital, all of which was available to support the aggregate capital requirements of its divisions and its corporate and other operations. based on our assessment of these businesses and operations, we believe this level of capital is consistent with our ratings targets.

(1)   amounts attributable to prudential financial, excluding aoci.
the decrease in other capital debt from december 31, 2014 primarily reflects a reduction in capital required as a result of positive net cash flows, including proceeds from the closed block restructuring received as part of a dividend from prudential insurance, and a reduction in capital debt through proceeds received from an issuance of junior subordinated debt.
insurance regulatory capital we manage prudential insurance, prudential of japan, gibraltar life, and our other domestic and international insurance subsidiaries to regulatory capital levels consistent with our "aa" ratings targets. we utilize the rbc ratio as a primary measure of the capital adequacy of our domestic insurance subsidiaries and the solvency margin ratio as a primary measure of the capital adequacy of our japanese insurance subsidiaries.
rbc is calculated based on statutory financial statements and risk formulas consistent with the practices of the naic. rbc considers, among other things, risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets, insurance-related risks associated with an insurer's products and liabilities, interest rate risks and general business risks. rbc ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring an insurer's solvency and ability to pay future claims. the reporting of rbc measures is not intended for the purpose of ranking any insurance company or for use in connection with any marketing, advertising or promotional activities, but is available to the public.
the rbc ratios for prudential insurance and prudential annuities life assurance corporation ("palac") were 498% and 647%, respectively, as of december 31, 2014. as of december 31, 2015, the rbc ratio for each of these subsidiaries was greater than 400%.
similar to the rbc ratios that are employed by u.s. insurance regulators, regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in which we operate generally establish some form of minimum solvency margin requirements for insurance companies based on local statutory accounting practices. these solvency margins are a primary measure of the capital adequacy of our international insurance operations. maintenance of our solvency margins at certain levels is also important to our competitive positioning, as in certain jurisdictions, such as japan, these solvency margins are required to be disclosed to the public and therefore impact the public perception of an insurer's financial strength.
the solvency margin ratios for prudential of japan and gibraltar life were 853% and 900%, respectively, as of september 30, 2015. as of december 31, 2015, the solvency margin ratio for each of these subsidiaries was greater than 700%.
all of our domestic and international insurance subsidiaries have capital levels that substantially exceed the minimum level required by applicable insurance regulations.
we evaluate the regulatory capital of our domestic and international insurance operations under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios and believe we have adequate resources to maintain our capital levels comfortably above regulatory requirements under these scenarios. for further information on the calculation of rbc and solvency margin ratios, as well as regulatory minimums, see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
capital protection framework we employ a "capital protection framework" (the "framework") to ensure that sufficient capital resources are available to maintain adequate capitalization on a consolidated basis and competitive rbc ratios and solvency margins for our insurance subsidiaries under various stress scenarios. the framework incorporates the potential impacts from market related stresses, including equity markets, real estate, interest rates, credit losses, and foreign currency exchange rates. in evaluating these potential impacts, we assess risk holistically at the enterprise level, recognizing that our business mix may produce results that partially offset on a net basis. the framework addresses the potential capital consequences, under stress scenarios, of certain of these net risks and the strategies we use to mitigate them, including the following:
141
•   equity market exposure affecting the statutory capital of the company as a whole, which we manage through our equity hedge program and on-balance sheet and contingent sources of capital;
•   our decision to manage a portion of our interest rate risk internally, on a net basis, at an enterprise level. in implementing this strategy, we execute intercompany derivative transactions between our corporate and other operations and certain business segments. we limit our exposure to the resulting net interest rate risk at the enterprise level through options embedded in our hedging strategy that may be exercised if interest rates decline below certain thresholds. the results of this strategy are described under "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-corporate and other"; and
•   activities of our business segments, including those for which specific risk mitigation strategies have been implemented, such as our living benefits hedging program that covers certain risks associated with our variable annuity products.
we periodically recalibrate our hedging strategies in response to changing market conditions. the framework accommodates periodic volatility within ranges that we deem acceptable, while also providing for additional potential sources of capital, including on-balance sheet capital, derivatives, and contingent sources of capital. although we continue to enhance our approach, we believe we currently have access to sufficient resources to maintain adequate capitalization and competitive rbc ratios and solvency margins under a range of potential stress scenarios.
captive reinsurance companies we use captive reinsurance companies in our domestic insurance operations to more effectively manage our reserves and capital on an economic basis and to enable the aggregation and transfer of risks. our captive reinsurance companies assume business from affiliates only. to support the risks they assume, our captives are capitalized to a level we believe is consistent with the "aa" financial strength rating targets of our insurance subsidiaries. all of our captive reinsurance companies are wholly-owned subsidiaries and are located domestically, typically in the state of domicile of the direct writing insurance subsidiary that cedes the majority of business to the captive. in addition to state insurance regulation, our captives are subject to internal policies governing their activities. in the normal course of business we contribute capital to the captives to support business growth and other needs. prudential financial has also entered into support agreements with the captives in connection with financing arrangements.
our domestic life insurance subsidiaries are subject to a regulation entitled "valuation of life insurance policies model regulation," commonly known as "regulation xxx," and a supporting guideline entitled "the application of the valuation of life insurance policies model regulation," commonly known as "guideline axxx". the regulation and supporting guideline require insurers to establish statutory reserves for term and universal life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees at a level that exceeds what our actuarial assumptions for this business would otherwise require. we use captive reinsurance companies to finance the portion of the reserves for this business that we consider to be non-economic as described below under "-financing activities-subsidiary borrowings-financing of regulatory reserves associated with domestic life insurance products."
we reinsure living benefit guarantees on certain variable annuity and retirement products from our domestic life insurance companies to a captive reinsurance company, pruco reinsurance, ltd. ("pruco re"). this enables us to aggregate these risks within pruco re and manage them more efficiently through a hedging program. we believe pruco re currently maintains an adequate level of capital and access to liquidity to support this hedging program; however, as discussed below under "liquidity associated with other activities-hedging activities associated with living benefit guarantees," pruco re's capital and liquidity needs can vary significantly due to, among other things, changes in equity markets, interest rates, mortality and policyholder behavior. through our capital protection framework, we ensure we have sufficient sources of capital available to meet these needs as they arise, using on-balance sheet capital and maintaining committed sources of capital. in 2016, we expect to recapture the risks related to our variable annuity living benefit riders that were previously reinsured to pruco re, and begin managing all of the product risks associated with our variable annuities in our statutory insurance entities. we expect this recapture to reduce the capital volatility associated with our individual annuities business.
through december 31, 2014, we utilized a captive reinsurance company domiciled in new jersey to reinsure 90% of the short-term risks of prudential insurance's former closed block business. effective january 1, 2015, this reinsurance arrangement was recaptured, and a related $2.0 billion letter of credit facility was terminated on january 2, 2015. this captive structure is no longer necessary due to the reinsurance of the closed block to prudential legacy insurance company of new jersey ("plic"), effective january 1, 2015. plic is a wholly-owned subsidiary of prudential insurance and is not a captive reinsurance company.

shareholder distributions share repurchase program and shareholder dividends in december 2015, the board authorized the company to repurchase at management's discretion up to $1.5 billion of its outstanding common stock during the period from january 1, 2016 through december 31, 2016. effective january 1, 2016, this authorization superseded the company's previous $1.0 billion share repurchase authorization that was announced in june 2015, covering the period from july 1, 2015 through june 30, 2016. the timing and amount of share repurchases will be determined by management based on market conditions and other considerations, including any increased capital needs of our businesses due to, among other things, changes in regulatory capital requirements and opportunities for growth and acquisitions. repurchases may be effected in the open market, through derivative, accelerated repurchase and other negotiated transactions and through plans designed to comply with rule 10b5-1(c) under the exchange act.
the following table sets forth information about declarations of common stock dividends, as well as repurchases of shares of prudential financial's common stock, for each of the quarterly periods in 2015 and for the prior four years.

in addition, on february 9, 2016, prudential financial's board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.70 per share of common stock, payable on march 17, 2016. as a designated financial company under dodd-frank, prudential financial expects to be subject to stricter requirements and limitations regarding capital, leverage and liquidity. our compliance with these and other requirements under dodd-frank could limit our ability to pay common stock dividends and repurchase shares in the future.
liquidity the principles of our liquidity management framework are described in an enterprise-wide liquidity policy that is reviewed and approved by the board. liquidity management and stress testing are performed on a legal entity basis as the ability to transfer funds between subsidiaries is limited due in part to regulatory restrictions. liquidity needs are determined through daily and quarterly cash flow forecasting at the holding company and within our operating subsidiaries. a minimum cash balance of at least $1.3 billion is targeted to ensure that adequate liquidity is available at prudential financial to cover fixed expenses in the event that we experience reduced cash flows from our operating subsidiaries at a time when access to capital markets is also not available. this targeted minimum balance is reviewed and approved annually by the board.
we seek to mitigate the risk of having limited or no access to financing due to stressed market conditions by generally pre-funding capital debt in advance of maturity. we mitigate the refinancing risk associated with our debt that is used to fund operating needs by matching the term of debt with the assets financed. to ensure adequate liquidity in stress scenarios, stress testing is performed for our major operating subsidiaries. we seek to further mitigate liquidity risk by maintaining our access to alternative sources of liquidity, as discussed below.
143
liquidity of prudential financial the principal sources of funds available to prudential financial, the parent holding company, are dividends and returns of capital from subsidiaries, repayments of operating loans from subsidiaries and cash and short-term investments. these sources of funds may be supplemented by prudential financial's access to the capital markets as well as the "-alternative sources of liquidity" described below.
the primary uses of funds at prudential financial include servicing debt, paying operating expenses, making capital contributions and loans to subsidiaries, paying declared shareholder dividends and repurchasing outstanding shares of common stock executed under authority from the board.
as of december 31, 2015, prudential financial had cash and short-term investments of $11,104 million, an increase of $40 million from december 31, 2014. we maintain an intercompany liquidity account that is designed to optimize the use of cash by facilitating the lending and borrowing of funds between prudential financial and its subsidiaries on a daily basis. excluding net borrowings from this intercompany liquidity account, prudential financial had cash and short-term investments of $5,062 million as of december 31, 2015, an increase of $746 million from december 31, 2014.
the following table sets forth prudential financial's principal sources and uses of cash and short-term investments, excluding net borrowings from our intercompany liquidity account, for the periods indicated.

(4)   includes cash payments made on dividends declared in prior periods.
(5)   2015 includes $13 million related to 2014 trades that settled in january 2015.
restrictions on dividends and returns of capital from subsidiaries our insurance companies are subject to limitations on the payment of dividends and other transfers of funds to prudential financial and other affiliates under applicable insurance law and regulation. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for details on specific dividend restrictions.
domestic insurance subsidiaries. prudential insurance is permitted to pay ordinary dividends based on calculations specified under new jersey insurance law, subject to prior notification to the new jersey department of banking and insurance ("njdobi"). any distributions above this amount in any twelve month period are considered to be "extraordinary" dividends, and the approval of the njdobi is required prior to payment. in may 2015, prudential insurance paid an extraordinary dividend in the amount of $1.95 billion to its parent, prudential financial.
the laws regulating dividends of the states where our other domestic insurance companies are domiciled are similar, but not identical, to new jersey's. during 2015, palac paid extraordinary dividends of $450 million to prudential financial, and pruco life paid extraordinary dividends of $430 million to its parent, prudential insurance.
international insurance subsidiaries. capital redeployment from our international insurance subsidiaries is subject to local regulatory requirements in the international jurisdictions in which they operate. our most significant international insurance subsidiaries, prudential of japan and gibraltar life, are permitted to pay common stock dividends based on calculations specified by japanese insurance law, subject to prior notification to the financial services agency ("fsa"). dividends in excess of these amounts and other forms of capital distribution require the prior approval of the fsa. in addition to paying common stock dividends, international insurance operations may return capital to prudential financial through other means, such as the repayment of subordinated debt or preferred stock obligations held by prudential financial or other affiliates. the current regulatory fiscal year end for both prudential of japan and gibraltar life is march 31, 2016, at which time the common stock dividend amount permitted to be paid without prior approval from the fsa will be determinable.
during 2015, prudential financial received $874 million from prudential international insurance holdings, the domestic parent of the international insurance subsidiaries, of which ¥97.8 billion, or approximately $819 million was from japanese subsidiaries and ₩70.0 billion, or approximately $55 million was from prudential of korea. dividends from japan consisted of common stock dividends of ¥10.3 billion, or approximately $86 million, from prudential of japan and ¥16.5 billion, or approximately $137 million, from gibraltar life and other japan operations. additionally, gibraltar life and other japan operations redeployed capital related to preferred stock obligations held by affiliates of ¥60.4 billion, or approximately $502 million, and repaid subordinated debt to affiliates of ¥10.0 billion, or approximately $83 million. as of december 31, 2015, gibraltar life had preferred stock obligations and subordinated debt held by affiliates of approximately $800 million.
other subsidiaries. the ability of our asset management subsidiaries and the majority of our other operating subsidiaries to pay dividends is largely unrestricted from a regulatory standpoint.
liquidity of insurance subsidiaries we manage the liquidity of our insurance operations to ensure stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of cash flows to meet all of our obligations. liquidity within each of our insurance subsidiaries is provided by a variety of sources, including portfolios of liquid assets. the investment portfolios of our subsidiaries are integral to the overall liquidity of our insurance operations. we segment our investment portfolios and employ an asset/liability management approach specific to the requirements of each of our product lines. this enhances the discipline applied in managing the liquidity, as well as the interest rate and credit risk profiles, of each portfolio in a manner consistent with the unique characteristics of the product liabilities.
145
liquidity is measured against internally-developed benchmarks that take into account the characteristics of both the asset portfolio and the liabilities that they support. we consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets (for example, type of asset and credit quality) in calculating internal liquidity measures to evaluate our insurance operations' liquidity under various stress scenarios, including company-specific and market-wide events. we continue to believe that cash generated by ongoing operations and the liquidity profile of our assets provide sufficient liquidity under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios for each of our insurance subsidiaries.
cash flow the principal sources of liquidity for our insurance subsidiaries are premiums, investment and fee income, and investment maturities and sales associated with our insurance and annuity operations, as well as internal and external borrowings. the principal uses of that liquidity include benefits, claims and dividends paid to policyholders, and payments to policyholders and contractholders in connection with surrenders, withdrawals and net policy loan activity. other uses of liquidity include commissions, general and administrative expenses, purchases of investments, the payment of dividends to the parent holding company, hedging activity and payments in connection with financing activities.
in each of our major insurance subsidiaries, we believe that the cash flows from operations are adequate to satisfy current liquidity requirements. the continued adequacy of this liquidity will depend upon factors such as future securities market conditions, changes in interest rate levels, policyholder perceptions of our financial strength, policyholder behavior, catastrophic events and the relative safety and attractiveness of competing products, each of which could lead to reduced cash inflows or increased cash outflows. our insurance operations' cash flows from investment activities result from repayments of principal, proceeds from maturities and sales of invested assets and investment income, net of amounts reinvested. the primary liquidity risks with respect to these cash flows are the risk of default by debtors or bond insurers, our counterparties' willingness to extend repurchase and/or securities lending arrangements, commitments to invest and market volatility. we closely manage these risks through our credit risk management process and regular monitoring of our liquidity position.
domestic insurance operations. in managing the liquidity of our domestic insurance operations, we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions when selecting assets to support these contractual obligations. we use surrender charges and other contract provisions to mitigate the extent, timing and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers. the following table sets forth the liabilities for future policy benefits and policyholders' account balances of certain of our domestic insurance subsidiaries as of the dates indicated.

the liabilities presented above are primarily supported by invested assets in our general account. as noted above, when selecting assets to support these contractual obligations, we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions. as a result, assets will include both liquid assets, as discussed below, and other assets that we believe adequately support our liabilities.
for prudential insurance and other subsidiaries, the liabilities presented above primarily include annuity reserves and deposit liabilities and individual life insurance policy reserves. individual life insurance policies may impose surrender charges and policyholders may be subject to a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy. prudential insurance's reserves for group annuity contracts primarily relate to pension risk transfer contracts, which are generally not subject to early withdrawal. for our individual annuity contracts, to encourage persistency, most of our variable and fixed annuities have surrender or withdrawal charges for a specified number of years. in addition, certain fixed annuities impose a market value adjustment if the invested amount is not held to maturity. the living benefit features of our variable annuities also encourage persistency because the potential value of the living benefit is fully realized only if the contract persists.
146
for priac, the liabilities presented above primarily include reserves for stable value contracts. although many of these contracts are subject to discretionary withdrawal, withdrawals are typically at the market value of the underlying assets. risk is further reduced by the high persistency of clients driven in part by our competitive position in our target markets and contractual provisions such as deferred payouts.
gross account withdrawals for our domestic insurance operations' products in 2015 were consistent with our assumptions in asset/liability management, and the associated cash outflows did not have a material adverse impact on our overall liquidity.
international insurance operations. as with our domestic operations, in managing the liquidity of our international insurance operations, we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions in selecting assets to support these contractual obligations. the following table sets forth the liabilities for future policy benefits and policyholders' account balances of certain of our international insurance subsidiaries as of the dates indicated.

the liabilities presented above are primarily supported by invested assets in our general account. when selecting assets to support these contractual obligations, we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions. as a result, assets will include both liquid assets, as discussed below, and other assets that we believe adequately support our liabilities.
we believe most of the longer-term recurring pay individual life insurance policies sold by our japanese operations do not have significant withdrawal risk because policyholders may incur surrender charges and must undergo a new underwriting process to obtain a new insurance policy.
gibraltar life sells fixed annuities, denominated in u.s. and australian dollars that may be subject to increased surrenders should the yen depreciate in relation to these currencies and interest rates in australia and the u.s. decline relative to japan. a significant portion of the liabilities associated with these contracts include a market value adjustment feature, which mitigates the profitability impact from surrenders. as of december 31, 2015, products with a market value adjustment feature represented $21.0 billion of our japan operations' insurance-related liabilities, which included $17.1 billion attributable to non-yen denominated fixed annuities.
in 2013, gibraltar life discontinued sales of a yen-denominated single premium reduced death benefit whole life product that had a greater savings component, which made it more susceptible to increased levels of surrenders if interest rates increase in japan. as of december 31, 2015, yen-denominated single premium reduced death benefit whole life products represented $7.8 billion of our japan operations' insurance-related liabilities.
liquid assets liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, fixed maturities that are not designated as held-to-maturity and public equity securities. in addition to access to substantial investment portfolios, our insurance companies' liquidity is managed through access to a variety of instruments available for funding and/or managing cash flow mismatches, including from time to time those arising from claim levels in excess of projections. our ability to utilize assets and liquidity between our subsidiaries is limited by regulatory and other constraints. we believe that ongoing operations and the liquidity profile of our assets provide sufficient liquidity under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios for each of our insurance subsidiaries.
the following table sets forth the fair value of certain of our domestic insurance operations' portfolio of liquid assets, including cash and short-term investments, fixed maturity investments other than those designated as held-to-maturity, classified by naic or equivalent rating, and public equity securities, as of the dates indicated.

(3)   of the $123.8 billion of fixed maturity investments that are not designated as held-to-maturity and considered high or highest quality as of december 31, 2015, $87.3 billion, or 71%, were invested in government or government agency bonds.
given the size and liquidity profile of our investment portfolios, we believe that claim experience, including policyholder withdrawals and surrenders, varying from our projections does not constitute a significant liquidity risk. our asset/liability management process takes into account the expected maturity of investments and expected claim payments as well as the specific nature and risk profile of the liabilities. to the extent we need to pay claims in excess of projections, we may borrow temporarily or sell investments sooner than anticipated to pay these claims, which may result in increased borrowing costs or realized investment gains or losses, including from changes in interest rates or credit spreads. the payment of claims and sale of investments earlier than anticipated would have an impact on the reported level of cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities, in our financial statements. historically, there has been no significant variation between the expected maturities of our investments and the payment of claims.

liquidity associated with other activities hedging activities associated with living benefit guarantees as discussed in "captive reinsurance companies" above, we reinsure living benefit guarantees on certain variable annuity and retirement products from our domestic life insurance companies to pruco re. as part of the living benefit hedging program, we enter into a range of exchange-traded, cleared and other otc equity and interest rate derivatives to hedge certain living benefit features accounted for as embedded derivatives against changes in certain capital market conditions such as interest rates and equity index levels. for a full discussion of our living benefits hedging program, see "-results of operations by segment-u.s. retirement solutions and investment management division-individual annuities." pruco re requires access to liquidity to meet its payment obligations under this program, such as payments for periodic settlements, purchases, maturities and terminations. pruco re's liquidity needs can vary materially due to, among other items, changes in interest rates, equity markets, mortality and policyholder behavior. currently, we fund these liquidity needs with a combination of pruco re's available resources and loans from prudential financial and other affiliates. in 2016, we expect to recapture the risks related to our variable annuity living benefit riders that were previously reinsured to pruco re, and begin managing all of the product risks associated with our variable annuities in our statutory insurance entities.
the living benefits hedging activity in pruco re may also result in collateral postings on derivatives to or from counterparties. the net collateral position depends on changes in interest rates and equity markets related to the amount of the exposures hedged. depending on market conditions, the collateral posting requirements can result in material liquidity needs. also, certain derivatives entered into on or after june 10, 2013, are subject to mandatory clearing requirements under dodd-frank and, as a result, typically have additional collateral requirements. as of december 31, 2015, the living benefit hedging derivatives were in a net receive position of $4.8 billion compared to a net receive position of $4.7 billion as of december 31, 2014.
foreign exchange hedging activities we employ various hedging strategies to manage potential exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements, particularly those associated with the yen. our overall yen hedging strategy calibrates the hedge level to preserve the relative contribution of our yen-based business to the company's overall return on equity on a leverage neutral basis. the hedging strategy includes two primary components:
•   income hedges-we hedge a portion of our prospective yen-based earnings streams by entering into external forward currency derivative contracts that effectively fix the currency exchange rates for that portion of earnings, thereby reducing volatility from foreign currency exchange rate movements. as of december 31, 2015, we have hedged 100%, 73% and 28% of expected yen-based earnings for 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.
•   equity hedges-we hold both internal and external hedges primarily to hedge our u.s. dollar-equivalent equity. these hedges also mitigate volatility in the solvency margins of yen-based subsidiaries resulting from changes in the market value of their u.s. dollar-denominated investments hedging our u.s. dollar-equivalent equity attributable to changes in the yen-u.s. dollar exchange rate.
for additional information on our hedging strategy, see "-results of operations by segment-international insurance division."
cash settlements from these hedging activities result in cash flows between subsidiaries of prudential financial and either international-based subsidiaries or external parties. the cash flows are dependent on changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the notional amount of the exposures hedged. a significant yen depreciation over an extended period of time could result in net cash inflows, while a significant yen appreciation could result in net cash outflows. the following tables set forth information about net cash settlements and the net asset or liability resulting from these hedging activities:

asset management operations the principal sources of liquidity for our fee-based asset management businesses include asset management fees and commercial mortgage origination and servicing fees. the principal uses of liquidity include general and administrative expenses and distributions of dividends and returns of capital to prudential financial. the primary liquidity risks for our fee-based asset management businesses relate to their profitability, which is impacted by market conditions and our investment management performance. we believe the cash flows from our fee-based asset management businesses are adequate to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of these operations, as well as requirements that could arise under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios, which are monitored through the use of internal measures.
the principal sources of liquidity for our strategic investments held in our asset management businesses are cash flows from investments, the ability to liquidate investments, and available borrowing lines from internal sources, including prudential financial and prudential funding, llc ("prudential funding"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of prudential insurance. the primary liquidity risks include the inability to sell assets in a timely manner, declines in the value of assets and credit defaults. there were no material changes to the liquidity position of our asset management operations during 2015.
alternative sources of liquidity in addition to the sources of liquidity discussed above, prudential financial and certain subsidiaries have access to the alternative sources of liquidity described below:
asset-based financing we conduct asset-based or secured financing within our insurance and other subsidiaries, including transactions such as securities lending, repurchase agreements and mortgage dollar rolls, to earn spread income, to borrow funds, or to facilitate trading activity. these programs are primarily driven by portfolio holdings of securities that are lendable based on counterparty demand for these securities in the marketplace. the collateral received in connection with these programs is primarily used to purchase securities in the short-term spread portfolios of our insurance entities. investments held in the short-term spread portfolios include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, mortgage loans and fixed maturities, including mortgage- and asset-backed securities, with a weighted average life at time of purchase by the short-term portfolios of four years or less. floating rate assets comprise the majority of our short-term spread portfolio. these short-term portfolios are subject to specific investment policy statements, which among other things, do not allow for significant asset/liability interest rate duration mismatch.
the following table sets forth our liabilities under asset-based or secured financing programs as of the dates indicated.

(1)   the daily weighted average outstanding balance for the year ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 was $8,221 million and $8,807 million, respectively, for pfi excluding the closed block division, and $4,755 million and $5,165 million, respectively, for the closed block division.
(2)   amount for pfi excluding the closed block division as of december 31, 2015 includes $2,256 million of securities that had a term greater than one day due to the timing of the january 1, 2016 holiday.
(3)   excludes securities that may be returned to the company overnight.
as of december 31, 2015, our domestic insurance entities had assets eligible for the asset-based or secured financing programs of $102 billion, of which $11.4 billion were on loan. taking into account market conditions and outstanding loan balances as of december 31, 2015, we believe approximately $13.4 billion of the remaining eligible assets are readily lendable, including approximately $10.1 billion relating to pfi excluding the closed block division, of which $1.7 billion relates to certain separate accounts and may only be used for financing activities related to those accounts, and the remaining $3.3 billion relating to the closed block division.
membership in the federal home loan banks prudential insurance is a member of the federal home loan bank of new york ("fhlbny"). membership allows prudential insurance access to the fhlbny's financial services, including the ability to obtain loans and to issue funding agreements as an alternative source of liquidity that are collateralized by qualifying mortgage-related assets or u.s. treasury securities. based on regulatory limitations, as of december 31, 2015, prudential insurance had an estimated maximum borrowing capacity of $7.4 billion under the fhlbny facility, of which $1.0 billion was outstanding.
priac is a member of the federal home loan bank of boston ("fhlbb"), which provides priac access to collateralized advances from the fhlbb. under connecticut law, without the prior consent of the connecticut insurance department, the amount of assets insurers may pledge to secure debt obligations is limited to the lesser of 5% of prior year statutory admitted assets or 25% of prior year statutory surplus, resulting in a maximum borrowing capacity for priac under the fhlbb facility of approximately $210 million, none of which was outstanding as of december 31, 2015.
borrowings under these facilities are subject to the fhlbny's and the fhlbb's discretion and require the availability of qualifying assets at prudential insurance and priac, respectively. for further information, see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.
commercial paper programs prudential financial and prudential funding have commercial paper programs with an authorized issuance capacity of $3.0 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively. prudential financial commercial paper borrowings generally have been used to fund the working capital needs of our subsidiaries. prudential funding commercial paper borrowings generally have been used to fund the working capital needs of prudential insurance and its subsidiaries. prudential funding also lends to other subsidiaries of prudential financial up to limits agreed with njdobi. prudential funding maintains a support agreement with prudential insurance whereby prudential insurance has agreed to maintain prudential funding's positive tangible net worth at all times. prudential financial has also issued a subordinated guarantee covering prudential funding's commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2015, prudential financial and prudential funding had outstanding borrowings of $80 million and $384 million, respectively, under these commercial paper programs. for further information, see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.

credit facilities we have access to a $4.0 billion syndicated, unsecured committed five year credit facility, expiring 2020, which has both prudential financial and prudential funding as borrowers. the facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including as backup liquidity for our commercial paper programs. there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility as of december 31, 2015, or as of the date of this filing.
the company expects that it may borrow under the facility from time to time to fund its working capital needs. in addition, amounts under the credit facility may be drawn in the form of standby letters of credit that can be used to meet the company's operating needs. the credit facility contains representations and warranties, covenants and events of default that are customary for facilities of this type, and borrowings are not contingent on the company's credit ratings nor subject to material adverse change clauses. borrowings require that the company maintain at all times consolidated net worth of at least $18.985 billion, which is calculated as u.s. gaap equity, excluding aoci, equity of noncontrolling interests and equity attributable to the closed block. as of december 31, 2015, the company's consolidated net worth exceeded this required minimum amount.
this credit facility, which was entered into on april 14, 2015, amends and restates the company's previously existing $2.0 billion five year credit facility and $1.75 billion three year credit facility.
put option agreement for senior debt issuance in november 2013, we entered into a ten year put option agreement with a delaware trust upon the completion of the sale of $1.5 billion of trust securities by that delaware trust in a rule 144a private placement. the trust invested the proceeds from the sale of the trust securities in a portfolio of principal and interest strips of u.s. treasury securities. the put option agreement provides prudential financial the right to sell to the trust at any time up to $1.5 billion of 4.419% senior notes due november 2023 and receive in exchange a corresponding amount of the principal and interest strips of u.s. treasury securities held by the trust. in return, we agreed to pay a semi-annual put premium to the trust at a rate of 1.777% per annum applied to the unexercised portion of the put option. the put option agreement with the trust provides prudential financial with a source of liquid assets. we will determine the use of proceeds from any exercise of the put option at the time of exercise. for example, proceeds could be used to meet general liquidity needs and/or to meet the capital requirements of our subsidiaries.
the put option described above will be exercised automatically in full upon our failure to make certain payments to the trust, such as paying the put option premium or reimbursing the trust for its expenses, if our failure to pay is not cured within 30 days, and upon an event involving our bankruptcy. we are also required to exercise the put option if our consolidated stockholders' equity, calculated in accordance with gaap but excluding aoci, falls below $7 billion, subject to adjustment in certain cases. we have a one-time right to unwind a prior voluntary exercise of the put option by repurchasing all of the senior notes then held by the trust in exchange for principal and interest strips of u.s. treasury securities. finally, any of the 4.419% senior notes that we issue may be redeemed by us prior to their maturity at par or, if greater, a make-whole price, following a voluntary exercise in full of the put option.
financing activities as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, total short-term and long-term debt of the company on a consolidated basis was $20.9 billion and $23.7 billion, respectively. the following table sets forth total consolidated borrowings of the company as of the dates indicated. we may, from time to time, seek to redeem or repurchase our outstanding debt securities through open market purchases, individually negotiated transactions or otherwise. any such repurchases will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity position and other factors.

(4)   amounts are net of assets under set-off arrangements of $4,889 million and $3,973 million, as of december 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively.
(5)   limited and non-recourse borrowing primarily represents mortgage debt of our subsidiaries that has recourse only to real estate investment property.
as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to the borrowings in the table above. for further information on our short- and long-term debt obligations, see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.
based on the use of proceeds, we classify our borrowings as capital debt, investment-related debt, and debt related to specified businesses. capital debt, which is debt utilized to meet the capital requirements of our businesses, was $12.1 billion and $13.3 billion as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. investment-related debt of $7.0 billion and $6.7 billion as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, consists of debt issued to finance specific investment assets or portfolios of investment assets, the proceeds from which will service the debt. specifically, this includes institutional spread lending investment portfolios, assets supporting reserve requirements under regulation xxx and guideline axxx as described below, as well as funding for institutional and insurance company portfolio cash flow timing differences. our remaining borrowings are utilized for business funding to meet specific purposes, including funding new business acquisition costs associated with our individual annuities business, operating needs associated with hedging our individual annuities products as discussed above and activities associated with our asset management business.
prudential financial borrowings long-term borrowings are conducted primarily by prudential financial. it borrows these funds to meet its capital and other funding needs, as well as the capital and funding needs of its subsidiaries. prudential financial maintains a shelf registration statement with the sec that permits the issuance of public debt, equity and hybrid securities. as a "well-known seasoned issuer" under sec rules, prudential financial's shelf registration statement provides for automatic effectiveness upon filing and has no stated issuance capacity.
prudential financial primarily issues senior debt under a medium-term notes program that had $10.9 billion of notes outstanding as of december 31, 2015. prudential financial also maintains a retail medium-term notes program, including internotes®, that had $477 million of notes outstanding as of december 31, 2015. the weighted average interest rate on prudential financial's outstanding senior notes, including the effect of interest rate hedging activity, was 5.03% and 5.18% for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, excluding the effect of debt issued to consolidated subsidiaries.
prudential financial had $5.9 billion of junior subordinated notes outstanding as of december 31, 2015 that are considered hybrid securities and receive enhanced equity treatment from the rating agencies. see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the key terms of our junior subordinated notes.
153
prudential financial borrowings of $17.3 million decreased $1.1 billion from december 31, 2014, driven primarily by maturities of $2.2 billion of medium-term notes and retail notes, partially offset by the issuance of $1.0 billion of junior subordinated notes and $0.2 billion of retail notes.
subsidiary borrowings subsidiary borrowings principally consist of surplus note issuances done within our insurance and captive reinsurance subsidiaries, commercial paper borrowings by prudential funding and asset-based financing. subsidiary borrowings of $3.6 billion decreased $1.7 billion from december 31, 2014, primarily driven by maturities of $0.7 billion of asset-backed notes, maturities of $0.3 billion of fhlbny advances, maturities of $0.1 billion of surplus notes and prepayments of $0.6 billion of senior debt.
financing of regulatory reserves associated with domestic life insurance products term and universal life reserve financing as discussed above under "capital-captive reinsurance companies," we use captive reinsurance subsidiaries to finance the portion of the statutory reserves required to be held by our domestic life insurance companies under regulation xxx and guideline axxx that we consider to be non-economic. the financing arrangements involve the reinsurance of term and universal life business to our captive reinsurers and the issuance of surplus notes by those captives that are treated as capital for statutory purposes. these surplus notes are subordinated to policyholder obligations, and the payment of principal on the surplus notes may only be made with prior insurance regulatory approval.
to date, we have entered into agreements with external counterparties providing for the issuance of up to an aggregate of $8.85 billion of surplus notes by our captive reinsurers in return for the receipt of credit-linked notes ("credit-linked note structures"), of which $6.50 billion of surplus notes was outstanding as of december 31, 2015. under the agreements, the captive receives in exchange for the surplus notes one or more credit-linked notes issued by a special-purpose affiliate of the company with an aggregate principal amount equal to the surplus notes outstanding. the captive holds the credit-linked notes as assets supporting regulation xxx or guideline axxx non-economic reserves, as applicable. the captive can redeem the principal amount of the outstanding credit-linked notes for cash upon the occurrence of, and in an amount necessary to remedy, a specified liquidity stress event affecting the captive. under the agreements, the external counterparties have agreed to fund any such payments under the credit-linked notes in return for the receipt of fees. prudential financial has agreed to make capital contributions to the captive to reimburse it for investment losses in excess of specified amounts and, under certain of the transactions, prudential financial has agreed to reimburse the external counterparties for any payments made under the credit-linked notes. to date, no such payments under the credit-linked notes have been required. under these transactions, because valid rights of set-off exist, interest and principal payments on the surplus notes and on the credit-linked notes are settled on a net basis, and the surplus notes are reflected in the company's total consolidated borrowings on a net basis.
the following table summarizes our credit-linked note structures, which are reported on a net basis, as of december 31, 2015:

__________
(1)   prudential financial has agreed to reimburse any amounts paid under the credit-linked notes issued in these structures.
(2)   the $1.6 billion surplus note represents an intercompany transaction that eliminates upon consolidation.
as of december 31, 2015, we also had outstanding an aggregate of $3.1 billion of debt issued for the purpose of financing regulation xxx and guideline axxx non-economic reserves, of which approximately $1.5 billion relates to regulation xxx reserves and approximately $1.6 billion relates to guideline axxx reserves, all of which was issued directly by or guaranteed by prudential financial. under certain of the financing arrangements pursuant to which this debt was issued, prudential financial has agreed to make capital contributions to the applicable captive reinsurance subsidiary to reimburse it for investment losses or to maintain its capital above prescribed minimum levels. in addition, as of december 31, 2015, for purposes of financing guideline axxx reserves, our captives had outstanding approximately $4.0 billion of surplus notes that were issued to affiliates.

as discussed under "business-regulation," in december 2014, the naic adopted a new actuarial guideline, known as "ag 48," that governs the reinsurance of term and universal life insurance business to captives by prescribing requirements for the types of assets that may be held by captives to support the reserves. the requirements in ag 48 became effective on january 1, 2015, and apply in respect of term and universal life insurance policies written from and after january 1, 2015, or written prior to january 1, 2015 but not included in a captive reserve financing arrangement as of december 31, 2014. ag 48 will require us to hold cash and rated securities in greater amounts than we previously held to support economic reserves for certain of our term and universal life policies. while we continue to work with regulators and industry participants on potential long-term solutions, we expect to fund the additional requirement for 2015, in an amount of approximately $400 million, using a combination of existing assets and newly purchased assets sourced from affiliated financing, and believe we have sufficient internal resources to finance reserves through 2016.
other insurance financing in 2014, prudential financial entered into financing transactions pursuant to which it issued $500 million of limited recourse notes and, in return, obtained $500 million of asset-backed notes issued by a designated series of a delaware master trust. the asset-backed notes mature from 2019 through 2021; however, the maturity date of a portion of the notes may be extended by us for up to three years, subject to certain conditions. the asset-backed notes were ultimately contributed to priac, an insurance subsidiary, to finance statutory surplus, and priac, in turn, paid cash dividends totaling $500 million to its parent, prudential insurance.
the master trust's payment obligations under each of the asset-backed notes are secured by corresponding payment obligations of a third-party financial institution and a portfolio of specified assets that have an aggregate value at least equal to the principal amount of the applicable asset-backed note. the principal amount of each asset-backed note is payable to priac in cash at any time upon demand by priac or, if not earlier paid, at maturity. each of the limited recourse notes obligates prudential financial to reimburse the applicable third-party financial institution for any principal payments received on the corresponding asset-backed note, but there is no obligation to reimburse any portion of a principal payment that is needed by priac to pay then current claims to its policyholders. each limited recourse note bears interest at a rate equal to the rate on the corresponding asset-backed note, plus an amount representing fees payable to the applicable third-party financial institution. as of december 31, 2015, no principal payments have been received or are currently due on the asset-backed notes and, as a result, there was no payment obligation under the limited recourse notes. accordingly, the notes are not reflected in the company's consolidated financial statements as of that date.
on february 18, 2015, plic entered into a twenty year financing facility with certain unaffiliated financial institutions and a special-purpose company affiliate, pursuant to which plic may, at its option and subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, issue and sell to the affiliate up to $4.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of surplus notes, in return for an equal principal amount of credit linked notes. upon issuance, plic would hold any credit linked notes as assets to finance future statutory surplus needs within plic.
ratings financial strength ratings (which are sometimes referred to as "claims-paying" ratings) and credit ratings are important factors affecting public confidence in an insurer and its competitive position in marketing products. our credit ratings are also important for our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt and for the cost of such financing. nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations continually review the financial performance and financial condition of the entities they rate, including prudential financial and its rated subsidiaries.
a downgrade in the credit or financial strength ratings of prudential financial or its rated subsidiaries could potentially, among other things, limit our ability to market products, reduce our competitiveness, increase the number or value of policy surrenders and withdrawals, increase our borrowing costs and potentially make it more difficult to borrow funds, adversely affect the availability of financial guarantees, such as letters of credit, cause additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements, allow counterparties to terminate derivative agreements and/or hurt our relationships with creditors, distributors, or trading counterparties thereby potentially negatively affecting our profitability, liquidity, and/or capital. in addition, we consider our own risk of non-performance in determining the fair value of our liabilities. therefore, changes in our credit or financial strength ratings may affect the fair value of our liabilities.
financial strength ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding the financial ability of an insurance company to meet its obligations under an insurance policy. credit ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding an entity's ability to repay its indebtedness. the following table summarizes the ratings for prudential financial and certain of its subsidiaries as of the date of this filing.

(5)   this rating for prudential life insurance company of taiwan, inc. was affirmed on december 10, 2015 by taiwan ratings corporation, a partner of s&amp;p.
the ratings set forth above reflect current opinions of each rating agency. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. these ratings are not directed toward shareholders and do not in any way reflect evaluations of the safety and security of the common stock. these ratings are reviewed periodically and may be changed at any time by the rating agencies. as a result, we cannot assure stakeholders that we will maintain our current ratings in the future.
rating agencies use an "outlook" statement for both industry sectors and individual companies. for an industry sector, a stable outlook generally implies that over the next 12-18 months the rating agency expects ratings to remain unchanged among companies in the sector. currently, moody's, a.m. best, s&p and fitch all have the u.s. life insurance industry on stable outlook. for a particular company, an outlook generally indicates a medium- or long-term trend (generally six months to two years) in credit fundamentals, which if continued, may lead to a rating change. these indicators are not necessarily a precursor of a rating change nor do they preclude a rating agency from changing a rating at any time without notice. currently, fitch has all the company's ratings on positive outlook, and moody's, s&p and a.m. best have all the company's ratings on stable outlook.

requirements to post collateral or make other payments as a result of ratings downgrades under certain agreements, including derivative agreements, can be satisfied in cash or by posting permissible securities held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements. in addition, a ratings downgrade by a.m. best to "a-" for our domestic life insurance companies would require prudential insurance to either post collateral or a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $1.5 billion, based on the level of statutory reserves related to the variable annuity business acquired from allstate. we believe that the posting of such collateral would not be a material liquidity event for prudential insurance.
in view of the difficulties experienced in recent years by many financial institutions, the rating agencies have heightened the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions, have increased the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, have requested additional information from the companies that they rate, and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels, such as the financial strength ratings currently held by our life insurance subsidiaries. in addition, actions we might take to access third-party financing or to realign our capital structure may in turn cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings.
the following is a summary of the significant changes or actions in our ratings and rating outlooks that have occurred from january 1, 2015 through the date of this filing.
on may 13, 2015, a.m. best affirmed prudential financial's long-term senior debt rating at "a-" and short-term debt rating at "amb-1". a.m. best also affirmed the "a+" financial strength ratings of prudential financial's core subsidiaries, including prudential insurance, palac and priac, with stable outlooks.
on september 17, 2015, s&p downgraded the financial strength and long-term counterparty credit ratings of prudential financial's japanese insurance subsidiaries from "aa-" to "a+" as a result of its decision to downgrade the sovereign debt ratings of japan from "aa-" to "a+". all ratings were assigned stable outlooks.
on september 18, 2015, s&p affirmed the long-term senior debt rating and short-term debt rating of prudential financial at "a" and "a-1", respectively, and the financial strength ratings of prudential financial's u.s. insurance subsidiaries at "aa-," in each case, with stable outlooks.
on november 11, 2015, moody's affirmed prudential financial's long-term senior debt rating at "baa1" and the "a1" financial strength ratings of prudential's operating subsidiaries, including prudential insurance and priac, with stable outlooks.
on december 15, 2015, fitch affirmed prudential financial's long-term senior debt rating at "bbb+" and the financial strength ratings of our u.s. operating entities at "a+", with positive outlooks.
contractual obligations the table below summarizes the future estimated cash payments related to certain contractual obligations as of december 31, 2015. the estimated payments reflected in this table are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations. because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the actual cash outflows in future periods will vary, possibly materially, from those reflected in the table. in addition, we do not believe that our cash flow requirements can be adequately assessed based solely upon an analysis of these obligations, as the table below does not contemplate all aspects of our cash inflows, such as the level of cash flow generated by certain of our investments, nor all aspects of our cash outflows.

__________
(1)   the estimated payments due by period for long-term debt reflects the contractual maturities of principal, as disclosed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, as well as estimated future interest payments. the payment of principal and estimated future interest for short-term debt are reflected in estimated payments due in 2016. the estimate for future interest payments includes the effect of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning our short-term and long-term debt.
(2)   the estimated payments due by period for operating and capital leases reflect the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating and capital leases, as disclosed in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements.
(3)   as discussed in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements, we have commitments to purchase or fund investments, some of which are contingent upon events or circumstances not under our control, including those at the discretion of our counterparties. the timing of the fulfillment of certain of these commitments cannot be estimated, therefore the settlement of these obligations are reflected in estimated payments due in less than one year. commitments to purchase or fund investments include $92 million that we anticipate will ultimately be funded from our separate accounts.
(4)   as discussed in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements, loan commitments of our commercial mortgage operations, which are legally binding commitments to extend credit to a counterparty, have been reflected in the contractual obligations table above principally based on the expiration date of the commitment; however, it is possible these loan commitments could be funded prior to their expiration date. in certain circumstances the counterparty may also extend the date of the expiration in exchange for a fee.
(5)   the estimated cash flows due by period for insurance liabilities reflect future estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and others for future policy benefits, policyholders' account balances, policyholder's dividends, reinsurance payables and separate account liabilities, net of premium receipts and reinsurance recoverables. these future estimated cash flows for current policies in force generally reflect our best estimate economic and actuarial assumptions. these cash flows are undiscounted with respect to interest. the sum of the cash flows shown for all years in the table of $1,122 billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of approximately $654 billion included in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31, 2015. separate account liabilities are legally insulated from general account obligations, and it is generally expected these liabilities will be fully funded by separate account assets and their related cash flows. we have made significant assumptions to determine the future estimated cash flows related to the underlying policies and contracts. due to the significance of the assumptions used, actual cash flows will differ, possibly materially, from these estimates.
(6)   the estimated payments due by period for other liabilities includes securities sold under agreements to repurchase, cash collateral for loaned securities, liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, bank customer liabilities, and other miscellaneous liabilities. amounts presented in the table also exclude $8,597 billion of notes issued by consolidated vie's which recourse for these obligations is limited to the assets of the respective vie and do not have recourse to the general credit of the company.
we also enter into agreements to purchase goods and services in the normal course of business; however, these purchase obligations are not material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position as of december 31, 2015.
off-balance sheet arrangements guarantees and other contingencies in the course of our business, we provide certain guarantees and indemnities to third parties pursuant to which we may be contingently required to make payments in the future. see "commitments and guarantees" within note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
other contingent commitments we also have other commitments, some of which are contingent upon events or circumstances not under our control, including those at the discretion of our counterparties. see "commitments and guarantees" within note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these commitments. for further discussion of certain of these commitments that relate to our separate accounts, also see "-liquidity associated with other activities-asset management operations."
other off-balance sheet arrangements in november 2013, we entered into a put option agreement with a delaware trust that gives prudential financial the right, at any time over a ten year period, to issue up to $1.5 billion of senior notes to the trust in return for principal and interest strips of u.s. treasury securities that are held by the trust. see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on this put option agreement. in 2014, prudential financial entered into financing transactions, pursuant to which it issued $500 million of limited recourse notes and, in return, obtained $500 million of asset-backed notes from a delaware master trust and ultimately contributed the asset-backed notes to its subsidiary, priac. as of december 31, 2015, no principal payments have been received or are currently due on the asset-backed notes and, as a result, there was no payment obligation under the limited recourse notes. accordingly, none of the notes are reflected in the company's consolidated financial statements as of that date. for further discussion see "-liquidity-financing activities."
other than as described above, we do not have retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities, or variable interests in unconsolidated entities or other similar transactions, arrangements or relationships that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support, that we believe are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or our access to or requirements for capital resources. in addition, other than the agreements referred to above, we do not have relationships with any unconsolidated entities that are contractually limited to narrow activities that facilitate our transfer of or access to associated assets.

risk management overview we employ a risk governance structure, overseen by senior management and our board of directors and managed by enterprise risk management ("erm"), to provide a common framework for evaluating the risks embedded in and across our businesses, developing risk appetites, managing these risks and identifying current and future risk challenges and opportunities.
risk governance framework each of our businesses has a risk governance structure that is supported by a framework at the corporate-level. generally, our businesses are authorized to make day-to-day risk decisions that are consistent with enterprise risk policies and limits, and subject to enterprise oversight. the governance structure described in this section is designed to support this framework.
board of directors' role in risk management our board of directors oversees our risk profile and management's processes for assessing and managing risk. certain specific categories of risk are assigned to board committees that report back to the full board, as summarized below:
•   audit committee: oversees risks related to operational risks, financial controls, legal, regulatory and compliance risks, and the overall risk management governance structure and risk management function.
•   finance committee: oversees risks involving our capital and liquidity management, the incurrence and repayment of borrowings, the capital structure, the funding of benefit plans and statutory insurance reserves. it also oversees the strength of the finance function. the finance committee reviews and recommends for approval to the board our capital plan. the finance committee also receives regular updates on the sources and uses of capital relative to plan, as well as on our capital protection framework.
•   investment committee: oversees investment and market risk and the strength of the investment function. the investment committee approves investment and market risk limits for prudential financial and for prudential insurance's general account based on asset class, issuer, credit quality and geography.
•   compensation committee: oversees our compensation programs so that incentives are aligned with appropriate risk taking.
•   corporate governance and business ethics committee: oversees our political contributions, lobbying expenses and overall political strategy, as well as our environmental, sustainability and corporate social responsibility.
•   risk committee: oversees the governance of significant risks throughout the company and the establishment and ongoing monitoring of our risk profile, risk capacity and risk appetite. the risk committee also serves to coordinate the risk oversight functions of the other committees of the board.
management committees our primary risk management committee is the enterprise risk committee ("erc"). the erc is chaired by our chief risk officer and otherwise comprised of the vice chairman, chief operating officers for the u.s. and international businesses, general counsel, chief financial officer, chief investment officer and chief actuary. our chief auditor also attends meetings of the erc. the erc's mandate is to review significant risks that impact us and approve, or recommend to the board for approval, our risk management policies and limits to keep our risk profile consistent with our strategy.
the erc is supported by five risk oversight committees, each of which is comprised of subject matter experts and dedicated to one of the following risk types: investment risk, market risk, insurance risk, operational risk and model risk. these risk oversight committees report their activities to the erc, and significant matters or matters where there are unresolved points of view are reviewed and brought to the erc. the risk oversight committees provide an opportunity to evaluate complex issues by subject matter experts within the various risk areas. they evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of risk mitigation options, identify stakeholders of risks and issues, review material risk assumptions for reasonability and consistency across the company and, working with the different risk areas, develop recommendations for risk limits, among other responsibilities.
each of our business units and significant corporate functions maintains its own risk committee. the business unit risk committees serve as a forum for leaders within each business unit to identify, assess and resolve risk and exposure issues and to review new products and initiatives, prior to such issues being reviewed by the risk oversight committees and/or the erc as appropriate. corporate function risk committees assess and monitor risks associated with performing the relevant corporate functions, set standards and exercise oversight over specific risks.
159
risk identification we use a variety of tools and processes to assess risk, such as quantitative tools for measurable financial risks and qualitative assessments for non-financial risks, such as certain operational risks.
beginning with the development of material new products or services, we complete a risk assessment which may lead to changes in design features, terms, pricing, investment strategy or the use of other risk mitigation techniques to affect the risk/reward dynamics for the product or service. we also weigh risk decisions against the impact to our reputation and our ability to achieve our ratings objectives.
risk exposure and monitoring we classify our risks into four general categories: investment risk, market risk, insurance risk and operational risk (which includes legal, regulatory and technology risk). in addition we are exposed to model risk, as well as reputational risk, which underlies, and is a part of, each risk assessment.
for information on risk as it relates to our capital and liquidity, see "-liquidity and capital resources."
investment risk management we view investment risk as the risk of loss on fixed maturity investments due to default or deterioration in credit quality, or loss on equity or real estate investments due to deterioration in value. our exposure to investment risk is primarily comprised of:
•   the risk that we will not receive contractual payments on a timely basis on fixed maturity investments (for example, credit default risk);
•   the risk that our fixed maturity investments lose value due to a deterioration of credit quality (for example, the probability of default rises or the likelihood of recovery on a default deteriorates);
•   the risk that a counterparty on derivatives, securities lending, reinsurance or other transactions does not meet its contractual obligations to us; and
•   the risk that values of our non-coupon, equity and/or real estate equity investments decline.
with general account fixed maturities of $322 billion as of december 31, 2015, prudential financial is exposed to significant credit risk. to manage this risk, we have a set of risk limits in place, including enterprise-level risk limits set by the investment committee of the board of directors. these limits are delineated into formal investment policy statements which set limits on asset classes, permissible instruments, individual issuer, industry/sector and geographic exposures by individual legal entities, segments and business units. compliance with most of these limits is measured on a daily basis, with some limits measured monthly or quarterly. in addition, our credit research departments closely monitor our credit exposures and maintain watch lists of exposures where there is a risk of impairment. if we have concerns about credit for a public exposure, we may sell some or all of that exposure or hedge the exposure with credit derivatives. see "-general account investments" for further information on our general account portfolio, including the composition of our fixed maturity portfolio by industry category and credit quality.
our fixed income investments are subject to the risk of credit spread widening; however, changes in valuation due to credit spread widening or tightening are not realized unless we sell the assets prior to maturity. we consider this risk in the asset valuations used in our liquidity analysis.
we also monitor our equity, real estate equity and other non-coupon investment exposures on an ongoing basis, and our risk and portfolio management functions review these portfolios quarterly.
market risk management we view market risk as the risk of loss from changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates resulting from asset/liability mismatches where the change in the value of our liabilities is not offset by the change in value of our assets.
our asset/liability mismatch exposure is primarily comprised of:
•   interest rate risk arising from asset/liability duration mismatches within our general account investments as well as invested assets of other entities and operations. for further information, see "-general account investments-management of investments" and "-general account investments-invested assets of other entities and operations" above.

•   equity risk primarily arising from unhedged equity exposure in our insurance liabilities, principally within our annuities segment. for further information, see "-individual annuities-variable annuity risks and risk mitigants" above.
•   foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from assets that are invested in a different currency than the related liability, as well as the unhedged portion of the company's earnings from, and capital supporting, operations in a foreign currency. for further information, see "-international insurance division-foreign currency exchange rate movements and related hedging strategies" above.
in addition, market factors impact certain fee based earnings streams, accounting for the amortization of costs into earnings and the capital levels of our regulated entities.
for additional information on our exposure to market risk, including how this risk is managed, see item 7a. "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."
insurance risk management we define insurance risk as the risk of loss due to deviations in experience compared to our assumptions. our exposure is primarily comprised of:
•   mortality risk, or the risk that death claims are greater than expected, primarily within our individual life, group insurance and international insurance segments, or the risk that policyholders survive longer than expected, primarily within our individual annuities, retirement and international insurance segments;
•   morbidity risk, or the risk that health claims from sickness or disability are greater than expected, primarily within our group insurance and international insurance segments as well as from long-term care policies within divested businesses; and
•   policyholder behavior risk, or the risk that our customers' persistency experience or utilization experience differs from our expectations.
underwriting insurance risk is a fundamental part of our business. we believe our scale provides for the benefits of diversification, both within an insurance risk type (potentially enhancing predictability of experience) and across insurance risk types (for example, to some extent, mortality risk provides a natural hedge against longevity risk). insurance risk mitigation begins with product design, as well as underwriting and pricing standards at the business unit level with corporate oversight. in some cases, the availability and/or credibility of policyholder behavior experience may be limited, which we strive to reflect in the product design and pricing of the product. we provide corporate oversight of the material insurance risk assumptions utilized in pricing and valuation.
operational risk management operational risk is defined as the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, employee actions, or as the result of external events. operational risks are broad in scope and evident in each business unit and corporate function. we are exposed to operational risk in many ways, including, but not limited to:
•   legal and regulatory compliance risk
•   sales practices risk
•   fraud (internal and external) risk
•   reputational risk
•   employee risk
•   technology risk, including data security, system failures and processing errors
•   financial reporting risk
•   extreme events risk, such as loss of people and/or infrastructure caused by natural disasters, terrorism, disease, etc.
•   information risk
•   vendor risk

each of our businesses and corporate functions is expected to manage its operational risks in compliance with enterprise standards. our framework for identifying, evaluating, monitoring and managing operational risk includes: risk management committees; key risk indicators; risk and control assessments; loss event data collection and analysis; scenario analysis; and resolution of control issues. we also have enterprise policies and standards, including: legal and regulatory/compliance policies, such as those relating to sales practices and supervision, fraud prevention, safeguarding of personal information, protection and use of material non-public information, personal conflicts of interest and outside business activities, anti-money laundering, and gifts and entertainment; human resources policies, such as those relating to hiring, training and terminating the employment of our associates and succession planning; and information technology policies, including those on systems development and information security. we also maintain policies and standards to support the effective management of operational risk, including those concerning new product development, business continuation and disaster recovery, enterprise crisis management, and vendor governance. our internal audit department independently audits key operational controls on a periodic basis to assess the effectiveness of our framework.
in order to respond to the threat of security breaches and cyber attacks, we have developed a program overseen by the chief information security officer and the information security office that is designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and continued availability of all information owned by, or in the care of the company. as part of this program, we also maintain an incident response plan. the program provides for the coordination of various corporate functions and governance groups, and serves as a framework for the execution of responsibilities across businesses and operational roles. the program establishes security standards for our technological resources, and includes training for employees, contractors and third parties. as part of the program, we conduct periodic exercises and a response readiness assessment with outside advisors to gain a third-party independent assessment of our technical program and our internal response preparedness. we regularly engage with the outside security community and monitor cyber threat information.
we are also exposed to emerging risks, such as those conditions, situations or trends that may significantly impact us in the future. by nature, these risks involve a high degree of uncertainty. erm, together with our businesses, monitors and evaluates emerging risks on a regular basis.
model risk management models are utilized by our businesses and corporate functions primarily in projecting future cash flows associated with pricing products, calculating reserves and valuing assets, as well as in evaluating risk and determining capital requirements, among other uses. as our businesses continue to grow and evolve, the number and complexity of models we utilize expands, increasing our exposure to error in the design, implementation or use of models, including the associated input data and assumptions. we are mitigating this risk by implementing our model risk policy, which outlines the governance and control requirements over the implementation and use of models, and through the activities of our model risk oversight committee which provides oversight and guidance on issues relating to model risk and the management of that risk.

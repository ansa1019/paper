item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the "forward-looking statements," our consolidated financial statements and notes that follow and the "consolidated five-year summary of selected financial data" and the "risk factors" included in our annual report on form 10-k. references to "ameriprise financial," "ameriprise," the "company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to ameriprise financial, inc. exclusively, to our entire family of companies, or to one or more of our subsidiaries.
overview ameriprise financial is a diversified financial services company with a more than 120 year history of providing financial solutions. we offer a broad range of products and services designed to achieve the financial objectives of individual and institutional clients. we are america's leader in financial planning and a leading global financial institution with more than $776 billion in assets under management and administration as of december 31, 2015. for additional discussion of our businesses, see part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k.
the financial results from the businesses underlying our go-to-market approaches are reflected in our five operating segments:
•   advice &amp; wealth management;
•   asset management;
•   annuities;
•   protection; and
•   corporate &amp; other.
our operating segments are aligned with the financial solutions we offer to address our clients' needs. the products and services we provide retail clients and, to a lesser extent, institutional clients, are the primary source of our revenues and net income. revenues and net income are significantly affected by investment performance and the total value and composition of assets we manage and administer for our retail and institutional clients as well as the distribution fees we receive from other companies. these factors, in turn, are largely determined by overall investment market performance and the depth and breadth of our individual client relationships.
financial markets and macroeconomic conditions have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our operating and performance results. in addition, the business and regulatory environment in which we operate remains subject to elevated uncertainty and change. to succeed, we expect to continue focusing on our key strategic objectives. the success of these and other strategies may be affected by the factors discussed in item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k - "risk factors."
equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the "spread" income generated on our fixed annuities, fixed insurance, deposit products and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of deferred acquisition costs ("dac") and deferred sales inducement costs ("dsic") assets, the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.
earnings, as well as operating earnings, will continue to be negatively impacted by the ongoing low interest rate environment. in addition to continuing spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines, a sustained low interest rate environment may result in increases to our reserves and changes in various rate assumptions we use to amortize dac and dsic, which may negatively impact our operating earnings. for additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see item 7a. "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."
in the third quarter of the year, we conduct our annual review of life insurance and annuity valuation assumptions relative to current experience and management expectations. to the extent that expectations change as a result of this review, we update valuation assumptions and the impact is reflected as part of our annual review of life insurance and annuity valuation assumptions and modeling changes ("unlocking"). the favorable unlocking impact in 2015 primarily reflected improved policyholder behavior, an update to market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation and model changes that more than offset the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment. in addition, our annual review of our closed long term care business resulted in no loss recognition as better-than-expected premium increases, which were reflected in our projections, offset higher morbidity and lower interest rates. the unfavorable unlocking impact in 2014 primarily reflected lower than previously assumed interest rates, partially offset by a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption. see our consolidated and segment results of operations sections below for the pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking and additional discussion of the drivers of the unlocking impact.

we consolidate certain collateralized loan obligations ("clos") and property funds for which we provide asset management services. these entities are defined as consolidated investment entities ("cies"). while the consolidation of the cies impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. for further information on cies, see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. changes in the valuation of the cie assets and liabilities impact pretax income. the net income (loss) of the cies is reflected in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. the results of operations of the cies are reflected in the corporate & other segment. on a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the cies and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the assets and liabilities related to the cies, primarily syndicated loans and debt, are reflected in net investment income. we continue to include the fees from these entities in the management and financial advice fees line within our asset management segment.
while our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), management believes that operating measures, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, net of the related dsic and dac amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges and the related dsic and dac amortization; the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges and the related dac amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; integration and restructuring charges; income (loss) from discontinued operations; and the impact of consolidating cies, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. management uses certain of these non-gaap measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. also, certain of these non-gaap measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. throughout our management's discussion and analysis, these non-gaap measures are referred to as operating measures. these non-gaap measures should not be viewed as a substitute for u.s. gaap measures.
it is management's priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets.
our financial targets are:
•   operating total net revenue growth of 6% to 8%,
•   operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and
•   operating return on equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("aoci") of 19% to 23%.
the following tables reconcile our gaap measures to operating measures:

critical accounting policies and estimates the accounting and reporting policies that we use affect our consolidated financial statements. certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and, in some cases, the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. the accounting and reporting policies and estimates we have identified as fundamental to a full understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition are described below. see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information about our accounting policies.
valuation of investments the most significant component of our investments is our available-for-sale securities, which we carry at fair value within our consolidated balance sheets. the fair value of our available-for-sale securities at december 31, 2015 was primarily obtained from third-party pricing sources. for a discussion on our accounting policies related to the valuation of our investments and other-than-temporary impairments, see note 2 and note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.
deferred acquisition costs we incur costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance and annuity businesses. the portion of these costs which are incremental and direct to the acquisition of a new or renewal insurance policy or annuity contract are deferred. significant costs capitalized include sales based compensation related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance policies and annuity contracts, medical inspection costs for successful sales, and a portion of employee compensation and benefit costs based upon the amount of time spent on successful sales. sales based compensation paid to advisors and employees and third-party distributors is capitalized. employee compensation and benefits costs which are capitalized relate primarily to sales efforts, underwriting and processing. all other costs which are not incremental direct costs of acquiring an insurance policy or annuity contract are expensed as incurred.
we monitor principal dac amortization assumptions, such as persistency, mortality, morbidity, interest margin, variable annuity benefit utilization and maintenance expense levels each quarter and, when assessed independently, each could impact our dac balance.
the analysis of the dac balance and the corresponding amortization is a dynamic process that considers all relevant factors and assumptions described previously. unless management identifies a significant deviation over the course of the quarterly monitoring, management reviews and updates these dac amortization assumptions annually in the third quarter of each year.
non-traditional long-duration products for our non-traditional long-duration products (including variable and fixed annuity contracts, universal life ("ul") and variable universal life ("vul") insurance products), our dac balance at any reporting date is based on projections that show management expects there to be estimated gross profits ("egps") after that date to amortize the remaining balance. these projections are inherently uncertain because they require management to make assumptions about financial markets, mortality levels and contractholder and policyholder behavior over periods extending well into the future. projection periods used for our annuity products are typically 30 to 50 years and for our ul insurance products 50 years or longer. management regularly monitors financial market conditions and actual contractholder and policyholder behavior experience and compares them to its assumptions.
egps vary based on persistency rates (assumptions at which contractholders and policyholders are expected to surrender, make withdrawals from and make deposits to their contracts), mortality levels, client asset value growth rates (based on equity and bond market performance), variable annuity benefit utilization and interest margins (the spread between earned rates on invested assets and rates credited to contractholder and policyholder accounts). when assumptions are changed, the percentage of egps used to amortize dac might also change. a change in the required amortization percentage is applied retrospectively; an increase in amortization percentage will result in a decrease in the dac balance and an increase in dac amortization expense, while a decrease in amortization percentage will result in an increase in the dac balance and a decrease in dac amortization expense. the impact on results of operations of changing assumptions can be either positive or negative in any particular period and is reflected in the period in which such changes are made.
the client asset value growth rates are the rates at which variable annuity and vul insurance contract values invested in separate accounts are assumed to appreciate in the future. the rates used vary by equity and fixed income investments. management reviews and, where appropriate, adjusts its assumptions with respect to client asset value growth rates on a regular basis. the long-term client asset value growth rates are based on assumed gross annual returns of 9% for equity funds and 6% for fixed income funds. we typically use a five-year mean reversion process as a guideline in setting near-term equity fund growth rates based on a long-term view of financial market performance as well as recent actual performance. the suggested near-term equity fund growth rate is reviewed quarterly to ensure consistency with management's assessment of anticipated equity market performance.
46
a decrease of 100 basis points in various rate assumptions is likely to result in an increase in dac amortization and an increase in benefits and claims expense from variable annuity guarantees. the following table presents the estimated impact to current period pretax income:
estimated impact to pretax income (1)
(in millions)
decrease in future near- and long-term fixed income returns by 100 basis points         $(62                                                                        )
decrease in future near-term equity fund growth returns by 100 basis points             $(41                                                                        )
decrease in future long-term equity fund growth returns by 100 basis points             (32                                                                         )
decrease in future near- and long-term equity fund growth returns by 100 basis points   $(73                                                                        )
(1) an increase in the above assumptions by 100 basis points would result in an increase to pretax income for approximately the same amount.
an assessment of sensitivity associated with changes in any single assumption would not necessarily be an indicator of future results.
traditional long-duration products for our traditional long-duration products (including traditional life, disability income ("di") and long term care ("ltc") insurance products), our dac balance at any reporting date is based on projections that show management expects there to be adequate premiums after the date to amortize the remaining balance. these projections are inherently uncertain because they require management to make assumptions over periods extending well into the future. these assumptions include interest rates, premium rate increases, persistency rates and mortality and morbidity rates and are not modified (unlocked) unless recoverability testing deems to be inadequate. projection periods used for our traditional life insurance are up to 30 years. projection periods for our ltc insurance products are often 50 years or longer and projection periods for our di products can be up to 45 years.
for traditional life and di insurance products, the assumptions provide for adverse deviations in experience and are revised only if management concludes experience will be so adverse that dac are not recoverable. if management concludes that dac are not recoverable, dac are reduced to the amount that is recoverable based on best estimate assumptions and there is a corresponding expense recorded in our consolidated statements of operations.
the assumptions for ltc insurance products include interest rates, premium rate increases, persistency rates and morbidity rates. these assumptions are management's best estimate from previous loss recognition and thus no longer provide for adverse deviations in experience.
policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and claims we establish reserves to cover the risks associated with non-traditional and traditional long-duration products and short-duration products. reserves for non-traditional long-duration products include the liabilities related to guaranteed benefit provisions added to variable annuity contracts, variable and fixed annuity contracts and ul and vul policies and the embedded derivatives related to variable annuity contracts, equity indexed annuities ("eia") and indexed universal life ("iul") insurance. reserves for traditional long-duration products are established to provide adequately for future benefits and expenses for term life, whole life, di and ltc insurance products. reserves for short-duration products are established to provide adequately for incurred losses primarily related to auto and home policies.
the establishment of reserves is an estimation process using a variety of methods, assumptions and data elements. if actual experience is better than or equal to the results of the estimation process, then reserves should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses. if actual experience is worse than the results of the estimation process, additional reserves may be required.
changes in future policy benefits and claims are reflected in earnings in the period adjustments are made. where applicable, benefit amounts expected to be recoverable from reinsurance companies who share in the risk are separately recorded as reinsurance recoverable within receivables.
non-traditional long-duration products liabilities for fixed account values on variable and fixed deferred annuities and ul and vul policies are equal to accumulation values, which are the cumulative gross deposits and credited interest less withdrawals and various charges.
a portion of our ul and vul policies have product features that result in profits followed by losses from the insurance component of the contract. these profits followed by losses can be generated by the cost structure of the product or secondary guarantees in the contract. the secondary guarantee ensures that, subject to specified conditions, the policy will not terminate and will continue to provide a death benefit even if there is insufficient policy value to cover the monthly deductions and charges. the liability for these future losses is determined by estimating the death benefits in excess of account value and recognizing the excess over the estimated life based on expected assessments (e.g. cost of insurance charges, contractual administrative charges, similar fees and investment
47
margin). see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the liability for contracts with secondary guarantees.
liabilities for eia are equal to the host contract values covering guaranteed benefits and the fair value of embedded equity options. liabilities for indexed accounts of iul products are equal to the accumulation of host contract values covering guaranteed benefits and the fair value of embedded equity options.
the majority of the variable annuity contracts offered by us contain guaranteed minimum death benefit ("gmdb") provisions. when market values of the customer's accounts decline, the death benefit payable on a contract with a gmdb may exceed the contract accumulation value. we also offer variable annuities with death benefit provisions that gross up the amount payable by a certain percentage of contract earnings which are referred to as gain gross-up ("ggu") benefits. in addition, we offer contracts with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ("gmwb") and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit ("gmab") provisions and, until may 2007, we offered contracts containing guaranteed minimum income benefit ("gmib") provisions.
the gmdb and ggu liability is determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits in excess of the projected contract accumulation value and recognizing the excess over the estimated life based on expected assessments (e.g., mortality and expense fees, contractual administrative charges and similar fees).
if elected by the contract owner and after a stipulated waiting period from contract issuance, a gmib guarantees a minimum lifetime annuity based on a specified rate of contract accumulation value growth and predetermined annuity purchase rates. the gmib liability is determined each period by estimating the expected value of annuitization benefits in excess of the projected contract accumulation value at the date of annuitization and recognizing the excess over the estimated life based on expected assessments.
the liability for the life contingent benefits associated with gmwb provisions is determined by estimating the expected value of benefits that are contingent upon survival after the account value is equal to zero and recognizing the benefits over the estimated life based on expected assessments (e.g., mortality and expense fees, contractual administrative charges and similar fees).
in determining the liabilities for gmdb, ggu, gmib and the life contingent benefits associated with gmwb, we project these benefits and contract assessments using actuarial models to simulate various equity market scenarios. significant assumptions made in projecting future benefits and assessments relate to customer asset value growth rates, mortality, persistency, benefit utilization and investment margins and are consistent with those used for dac valuation for the same contracts. as with dac, management reviews, and where appropriate, adjusts its assumptions each quarter. unless management identifies a material deviation over the course of quarterly monitoring, management reviews and updates these assumptions annually in the third quarter of each year. the amounts in the table above in "deferred acquisition costs" include the estimated impact to benefits and claims expense related to variable annuity guarantees resulting from a decrease of 100 basis points in various rate assumptions.
the fair value of embedded derivatives related to gmab and the non-life contingent benefits associated with gmwb provisions fluctuates based on equity, interest rate and credit markets which can cause these embedded derivatives to be either an asset or a liability. see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the fair value measurement of embedded derivatives.
liabilities for fixed annuities in a benefit or payout status are based on future estimated payments using established industry mortality tables and interest rates, ranging from 2.75% to 9.38% at december 31, 2015, depending on year of issue, with an average rate of approximately 4.45%.
traditional long-duration products the liabilities for traditional long-duration products include liabilities for unpaid amounts on reported claims, estimates of benefits payable on claims incurred but not yet reported and estimates of benefits that will become payable on term life, whole life, di and ltc policies as claims are incurred in the future.
liabilities for unpaid amounts on reported life insurance claims are equal to the death benefits payable under the policies. liabilities for unpaid amounts on reported di and ltc claims include any periodic or other benefit amounts due and accrued, along with estimates of the present value of obligations for continuing benefit payments. these amounts are calculated based on claim continuance tables which estimate the likelihood an individual will continue to be eligible for benefits. the discount rates used to calculate present values are based on average interest rates earned on assets supporting the liability for unpaid amounts and were 5% and 6.25% for di and ltc claims, respectively, at december 31, 2015. anticipated claim continuance rates are based on established industry tables, adjusted as appropriate for our experience.
liabilities for estimated benefits payable on claims that have been incurred but not yet reported are based on periodic analysis of the actual time lag between when a claim occurs and when it is reported.
liabilities for estimates of benefits that will become payable on future claims on term life, whole life, di and ltc policies are based on the net level premium method, using anticipated premium payments, mortality and morbidity rates, policy persistency and interest rates earned on assets supporting the liability. anticipated mortality and morbidity rates are based on established industry mortality and morbidity tables, with modifications based on our experience. anticipated premium payments and persistency rates vary by policy

form, issue age, policy duration and certain other pricing factors. anticipated interest rates for term and whole life ranged from 3.25% to 10% at december 31, 2015, depending on policy form, issue year and policy duration. anticipated interest rates for di policies ranged from 4% to 7.5% at december 31, 2015, depending on policy form, issue year and policy duration. anticipated interest rates for ltc policy reserves can vary by plan and year and ranged from 6.37% to 9.4% at december 31, 2015.
for term life, whole life, di and ltc polices, we utilize best estimate assumptions as of the date the policy is issued with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation, as appropriate. after the liabilities are initially established, management performs premium deficiency tests annually in the third quarter of each year using best estimate assumptions without provisions for adverse deviation. if the liabilities determined based on these best estimate assumptions are greater than the net reserves (i.e., gaap reserves net of any dac balance), the existing net reserves are adjusted by first reducing the dac balance by the amount of the deficiency or to zero through a change to current period earnings. if the deficiency is more than the dac balance, then the net reserves are increased by the excess through a charge to current period earnings. if a premium deficiency is recognized, the assumptions are locked in and used in subsequent valuations. the assumptions for ltc insurance products are management's best estimate from previous loss recognition and thus no longer provide for adverse deviations in experience.
short-duration products the liabilities for short-duration products primarily include auto and home reserves comprised of amounts determined from loss reports on individual claims, as well as amounts based on historical loss experience for losses incurred but not yet reported. such liabilities are based on estimates. our methods for making such estimates and for establishing the resulting liabilities are continually reviewed, and any adjustments are reflected in earnings in the period such adjustments are made.
derivative instruments and hedging activities we use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to various market risks. all derivatives are recorded at fair value. the fair value of our derivative instruments is determined using either market quotes or valuation models that are based upon the net present value of estimated future cash flows and incorporate current market observable inputs to the extent available.
for further details on the types of derivatives we use and how we account for them, see note 2, note 14 and note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. for discussion of our market risk exposures and hedging program and related sensitivity testing, see item 7a. "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."
income tax accounting inherent in the provision for income taxes are estimates and judgments regarding the tax treatment of certain items. estimates and judgments are re-evaluated on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. in the event that the ultimate tax treatment of items differs from our estimates, we may be required to significantly change the provision for income taxes recorded in our consolidated financial statements.
we are required to establish a valuation allowance for any portion of our deferred tax assets that management believes will not be realized. significant judgment is required in determining if a valuation allowance should be established, and the amount of such allowance if required. factors used in making this determination include estimates relating to the performance of the business. consideration is given to, among other things in making this determination, (i) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, (iii) taxable income in prior carryback years, and (iv) tax planning strategies. management may need to identify and implement appropriate planning strategies to ensure our ability to realize our deferred tax assets and reduce the likelihood of the establishment of a valuation allowance with respect to such assets.
see note 2 and note 21 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our accounting policies for income taxes and our valuation allowance.
recent accounting pronouncements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition, see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.
sources of revenues and expenses management and financial advice fees management and financial advice fees relate primarily to fees earned from managing mutual funds, separate account and wrap account assets and institutional investments, as well as fees earned from providing financial advice, administrative services (including transfer agent and administration fees earned from providing services to retail mutual funds) and other custodial services. management and financial advice fees include performance-based incentive management fees, which we may receive on certain management contracts. management and financial advice fees also include mortality and expense risk fees.
49
distribution fees distribution fees primarily include point-of-sale fees (such as mutual fund front-end sales loads) and asset-based fees (such as 12b-1 distribution and shareholder service fees). distribution fees also include amounts received under marketing support arrangements for sales of mutual funds and other companies' products, such as through our wrap accounts, as well as surrender charges on fixed and variable universal life insurance and annuities.
net investment income net investment income primarily includes interest income on fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale, mortgage loans, policy and certificate loans, other investments, cash and cash equivalents and investments of cies; the changes in fair value of trading securities, certain derivatives and certain assets and liabilities of cies; the pro rata share of net income or loss on equity method investments; and realized gains and losses on the sale of securities and charges for other-than-temporary impairments of investments related to credit losses.
premiums premiums include premiums on auto and home insurance, traditional life and health (di and ltc) insurance and immediate annuities with a life contingent feature and are net of reinsurance premiums.
other revenues other revenues primarily include variable annuity guaranteed benefit rider charges and fixed and variable universal life insurance charges, which consist of cost of insurance charges (net of reinsurance premiums and cost of reinsurance for ul insurance products) and administrative charges. we also record revenue related to consolidated property funds managed by threadneedle. these revenues represent rental income of managed properties and changes in the fair value of real estate held in consolidated property funds.
for discussion of our accounting policies on revenue recognition, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
banking and deposit interest expense banking and deposit interest expense primarily includes interest expense related to investment certificates. the changes in fair value of stock market certificate embedded derivatives and the derivatives hedging stock market certificates are included within banking and deposit interest expense.
distribution expenses distribution expenses primarily include compensation paid to our financial advisors, registered representatives, third-party distributors and wholesalers, net of amounts capitalized and amortized as part of dac. the amounts capitalized and amortized are based on actual distribution costs. the majority of these costs, such as advisor and wholesaler compensation, vary directly with the level of sales. distribution expenses also include marketing support and other distribution and administration related payments made to affiliated and unaffiliated distributors of products provided by our affiliates. the majority of these expenses vary with the level of sales, or assets held, by these distributors, and the remainder is fixed. distribution expenses also include wholesaling costs.
interest credited to fixed accounts interest credited to fixed accounts represents amounts earned by contractholders and policyholders on fixed account values associated with fixed and variable universal life and annuity contracts. the changes in fair value of equity indexed annuity and iul embedded derivatives and the derivatives hedging these products are included within interest credited to fixed accounts.
benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses consist of amounts paid and changes in liabilities held for anticipated future benefit payments under insurance policies and annuity contracts, along with costs to process and pay such amounts. amounts are net of benefit payments recovered or expected to be recovered under reinsurance contracts. benefits under variable annuity guarantees include the changes in fair value of gmwb and gmab embedded derivatives and the derivatives hedging these benefits, as well as the changes in fair value of derivatives hedging gmdb provisions. benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses also include amortization of dsic.
amortization of dac direct sales commissions and other costs capitalized as dac are amortized over time. for annuity and ul contracts, dac are amortized based on projections of estimated gross profits over amortization periods equal to the approximate life of the business. for other insurance products, dac are generally amortized as a percentage of premiums over amortization periods equal to the premium-paying period.
interest and debt expense interest and debt expense primarily includes interest on corporate debt and debt of cies, the impact of interest rate hedging activities and amortization of debt issuance costs.
50
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense includes compensation, share-based awards and other benefits for employees (other than employees directly related to distribution, including financial advisors), professional and consultant fees, information technology, facilities and equipment, advertising and promotion, legal and regulatory and corporate related expenses.
assets under management and administration assets under management ("aum") include external client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the columbia management funds and threadneedle funds, assets of institutional clients and assets of clients in our advisor platform held in wrap accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisers selected by us. aum also includes certain assets on our consolidated balance sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our asset management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and cies. these assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority. corporate & other aum primarily includes former bank assets that are managed within our corporate & other segment.
assets under administration ("aua") include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies' products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. these assets include those held in clients' brokerage accounts. we generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. we do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. these assets are not reported on our consolidated balance sheets. aua also includes certain assets on our consolidated balance sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. these assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.

overall income from continuing operations before income tax provision decreased $405 million, or 16%, to $2.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $2.5 billion for the prior year primarily reflecting a $256 million decrease in net income from cies, a negative market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related dsic and dac amortization), a $42 million benefit in the prior year from policyholder movement of investments in portfolio navigator (traditional asset allocation) funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the portfolio stabilizer (managed volatility) funds compared to a $6 million benefit for the current year, an increase in provision for estimated losses for our auto and home business, higher life and ltc insurance claims, fixed annuity net outflows, a negative impact of foreign exchange, asset management net outflows, a decrease in net realized investment gains, the unfavorable market impact of hedges on investments and the impact on dac and dsic from actual versus expected market performance, partially offset by the favorable impact of unlocking, higher asset management performance fees, wrap account net inflows, market appreciation, and lower performance-based compensation expense.
the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related dsic and dac amortization) was an expense of $214 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to an expense of $94 million for the prior year. the impact on dac and dsic from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was an expense of $19 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 reflecting unfavorable equity market returns compared to a benefit of $26 million for the prior year reflecting favorable equity market and bond fund returns.

(1) includes a $6 million net benefit related to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits and indexed universal life benefits for the year ended december 31, 2015.
net revenues net revenues decreased $98 million, or 1%, to $12.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $12.3 billion for the prior year primarily due to a decrease in other revenues, partially offset by an increase in management and financial advice fees.
management and financial advice fees increased $140 million, or 2%, to $6.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $5.8 billion for the prior year primarily due to higher asset-based fees driven by an increase in average aum and a $39 million increase in performance fees. average aum increased $2.1 billion to $653.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $651.4 billion for the prior year primarily due to market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. see our discussion on the changes in aum in our segment results of operations section below.
distribution fees decreased $47 million, or 2%, to $1.8 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $1.9 billion for the prior year primarily due to lower client activity.
net investment income decreased $53 million, or 3%, to $1.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $1.7 billion for the prior year due to a $76 million decrease in investment income on fixed maturities primarily due to low interest rates, a $21 million loss related to the market impact of hedges on investments and a $33 million decrease in net realized investment gains, partially offset by a $74 million increase in net investment income of cies.
premiums increased $70 million, or 5%, to $1.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $1.4 billion for the prior year primarily due to a 3% increase in auto and home policies in force.
other revenues decreased $206 million, or 14%, to $1.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year due to a $278 million decrease in other revenues of cies primarily due to lower gains from changes in the fair value of real estate held in the consolidated property funds, partially offset by the impact of unlocking and higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates. other revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015 included an $8 million favorable impact from unlocking compared to a $29 million negative impact in the prior year. the primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015 was a positive impact from model updates related to our indexed universal life product, partially offset by a negative impact from lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience. the primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the prior year was lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience.
expenses total expenses increased $307 million, or 3%, to $10.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $9.7 billion for the prior year primarily due to an increase in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses.
distribution expenses increased $40 million, or 1%, to $3.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $3.2 billion for the prior year driven by higher advisor compensation due to growth in average assets under management.
interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $45 million, or 6%, to $668 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $713 million for the prior year driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances. average fixed annuity account balances decreased $1.3 billion, or 11%, to $11.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the prior year due to net outflows reflecting higher lapse rates and limited new sales due to low interest rates.
53
benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $279 million, or 14%, to $2.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $2.0 billion for the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:
•   the year ended december 31, 2015 included a $58 million benefit from unlocking compared to a $6 million expense in the prior year. the unlocking impact for the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily reflected an update to market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation and a benefit from model changes that more than offset the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment. the unlocking impact for the prior year reflected lower than previously assumed interest rates, partially offset by a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption.
•   a $106 million increase related to our auto and home business due to an increase in the provision for estimated losses reflecting the impact of growth in exposures due to a 3% increase in policies in force, higher 2015 accident year loss ratio assumptions and prior year development. in 2015, we increased our claims reserves $57 million primarily related to the 2014 and prior accident years auto liability coverages. this increase was driven by elevated frequency and severity experience for auto injury claims, as well as a lower than expected level of impact in improving the outcome of 2014 and prior accident year existing claims. auto and home losses for the prior year included a $30 million increase to prior accident year loss reserves resulting from adverse development in the 2013 and prior accident years auto liability coverage and a $60 million increase to loss reserves for estimated losses including incurred but not reported ("ibnr") claims resulting from further adverse loss development observed primarily in the 2014 auto book of business. catastrophe losses were $72 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $66 million for the prior year.
•   a $17 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.
•   an increase in expenses compared to the prior year due to a $50 million benefit for the year ended december 31, 2014 from policyholder movement of investments in portfolio navigator funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the portfolio stabilizer funds compared to a $7 million benefit for the year ended december 31, 2015.
•   a $20 million increase in life insurance claims compared to the prior year primarily due to larger claims.
•   a $19 million increase in ltc claims compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in the number of open claims and an update in claim reserve assumptions partially offset by a higher interest rate used for ltc claims and the release of additional ltc reserves.
•   a $28 million favorable impact in 2015 from updating future experience assumptions relating to life rider benefits.
•   a $78 million increase in expense compared to the prior year from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. as the embedded derivative liability on which the nonperformance credit spread is applied increases (decreases), the impact of the nonperformance credit spread is favorable (unfavorable) to expense. the favorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $68 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to a favorable impact of $146 million for the prior year.
•   a $60 million increase in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related dsic amortization. this increase was the result of a favorable $785 million change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves, an unfavorable $843 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits and an unfavorable $2 million dsic offset. the main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:
•   interest rate impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in lower expense in 2015 compared to 2014.
•   equity market and volatility impacts on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in an expense in 2015 compared to a benefit in 2014.
•   other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a net unfavorable impact compared to the prior year.
interest and debt expense increased $59 million, or 18%, to $387 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $328 million for the prior year due to new clos launched in 2015.
income taxes our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations including income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 21.3% for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 21.4% for the prior year. our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations excluding income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 22.6% for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 25.2% for the prior year. the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2015 was lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction and low income housing tax credits.

mutual fund performance rankings are based on the performance of class z fund shares for columbia branded mutual funds. only funds with class z shares are included. in instances where a fund's class z share does not have a full five year track record (prior to september 30, 2015), performance for an older share class of the same fund, typically class a shares, is utilized for the period before class z shares were launched. no adjustments to the historical track records are made to account for differences in fund expenses between share classes of a fund. starting september 30, 2015, legacy riversource funds have reached 5 years of z share performance and will not be appended. historical rankings will continue to be appended.
equal weighted rankings in top 2 quartiles: counts the number of funds with above median ranking divided by the total number of funds. asset size is not a factor.
asset weighted rankings in top 2 quartiles: sums the total assets of the funds with above median ranking (using class z and appended class z) divided by total assets of all funds. funds with more assets will receive a greater share of the total percentage above or below median.

total segment aum decreased $33.7 billion, or 7%, during the year ended december 31, 2015 driven by net outflows, retail fund distributions and a negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by market appreciation. total segment aum net outflows were $15.8 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015. management expects, consistent with prior patterns of outflows, that outflows of primarily low margin assets directly or indirectly affiliated with threadneedle and columbia former parent companies will continue for the foreseeable future. the overall impact to segment results is difficult to quantify due to uncertain timing, volume and mix of the outflows.
columbia managed assets decreased $26.5 billion, or 7%, during the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily due to net outflows and retail fund distributions. total columbia net outflows were $8.9 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015. columbia retail funds decreased $19.3 billion, or 8%, during the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily due to net outflows and distributions. columbia retail net outflows of $2.6 billion during the year ended december 31, 2015 included $1.3 billion related to a client's decision in the third quarter to exit its portfolio due to asset allocation and $2.0 billion of outflows from a former parent affiliated distribution relationship. underlying columbia retail outflows were largely driven by $8.2 billion of outflows from the columbia acorn® fund, as well as market volatility that decreased investor demand, offset by reinvested dividends. columbia institutional aum decreased $6.4 billion, or 8%, during the year ended december 31, 2015 due to net outflows of $7.0 billion primarily reflecting outflows from former parent affiliated distribution and former parent influenced mandates.

our annuities segment pretax operating income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses (net of the related dsic and dac amortization) and the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related dsic and dac amortization), increased $17 million, or 3%, to $650 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $633 million for the prior year primarily due to the impact of unlocking, partially offset by the impact on dac and dsic from actual versus expected market performance, the negative impact from fixed annuity net outflows and a $44 million benefit in the prior year from policyholder movement of investments in portfolio navigator funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the portfolio stabilizer funds compared to a $6 million benefit in the current year.
the impact of unlocking was an increase to pretax operating income of $66 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to a decrease of $22 million for the prior year. the impact on dac and dsic from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was an expense of $18 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 reflecting unfavorable equity market returns compared to a benefit of $24 million for the prior year reflecting favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns.
riversource variable annuity account balances decreased $2.7 billion, or 4%, to $74.2 billion at december 31, 2015 compared to the prior year due to net outflows of $1.2 billion and market depreciation.
riversource fixed annuity account balances declined $1.5 billion, or 12%, to $10.7 billion at december 31, 2015 compared to the prior year reflecting limited new sales from low interest rates and higher lapse rates as a portion of the five-year guarantee block that was re-priced during 2014 came out of its surrender charge period earlier in 2015. given the current interest rate environment, our fixed annuity book is expected to gradually run off and earnings on our fixed annuity business will trend down.
net revenues net revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $50 million, or 2%, to $2.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $2.6 billion for the prior year primarily due to lower net investment income, partially offset by an increase in other revenues.
net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $93 million, or 10%, to $848 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $941 million for the prior year primarily reflecting lower invested assets due to fixed annuity net outflows.
63
other revenues increased $42 million, or 10%, to $467 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $425 million for the prior year due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates.
expenses total expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related dsic and dac amortization) and the dac and dsic offset to net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $67 million, or 3%, to $1.9 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $2.0 billion for the prior year primarily due to decreases in interest credited to fixed accounts and amortization of dac, partially offset by an increase in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses.
interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $56 million, or 10%, to $500 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $556 million for the prior year driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances. average fixed annuity account balances decreased $1.3 billion, or 11%, to $11.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the prior year due to net outflows reflecting higher lapse rates and limited new sales due to low interest rates.
benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related dsic amortization) and the dsic offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $19 million, or 4%, to $482 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $463 million for the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:
•   the year ended december 31, 2015 included a $61 million benefit from unlocking primarily reflecting an update to market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation and a benefit from model changes that more than offset the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment. the prior year included a $5 million expense from unlocking primarily reflecting lower than previously assumed interest rates, partially offset by a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption.
•   an increase in expenses compared to the prior year due to a $52 million benefit for the year ended december 31, 2014 from policyholder movement of investments in portfolio navigator funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the portfolio stabilizer funds compared to a $7 million benefit for the year ended december 31, 2015.
•   a $17 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.
•   a $9 million increase in expense compared to the prior year due to the impact on dsic from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance. this impact was an expense of $4 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 reflecting unfavorable equity market returns compared to a benefit of $5 million for the prior year reflecting favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns.
amortization of dac, which excludes the dac offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits and the dac offset to net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $30 million, or 13%, to $205 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $235 million for the prior year primarily due to the impact of unlocking, partially offset by the impact on dac from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance. amortization of dac for the year ended december 31, 2015 included a $5 million benefit from unlocking driven by improved persistency that more than offset the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment. amortization of dac for the prior year included a $17 million expense from unlocking primarily driven by lower than previously assumed interest rates, partially offset by favorable persistency and mortality experience and a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption.

our protection segment pretax operating income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses (net of the related dac amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual) and the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related dac amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual), decreased $63 million, or 26%, to $183 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $246 million for the prior year primarily reflecting an increase in the provision for estimated losses for our auto and home business and higher life and ltc insurance claims, partially offset by higher auto and home premiums.
during 2015, we conducted a review of our ltc reserve for unpaid amounts on reported claims based on additional information we received from genworth financial, inc., which reinsures 50% of our ltc business and administers all of our claims. based on this information, along with a review of the discount rate, management's best estimate for ltc claims reserves resulted in a net $14 million increase. the most significant drivers of the reserve increase were updates to the benefit utilization rates and claims termination rates, partially offset by a $15 million benefit from a higher discount rate. we also increased the discount rate for our disability income ("di") reserve for unpaid amounts on reported claims, which resulted in a $7 million reserve decrease. in addition, results for 2015 included an $11 million unfavorable impact related to a reinsurance premium correction, a $13 million favorable impact related to a ltc future loss reserve adjustment and a $28 million favorable impact from updating future experience assumptions relating to life rider benefits.
net revenues net revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses (net of unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual) and the unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, increased $97 million, or 4%, to $2.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $2.3 billion for the prior year primarily due to an increase in premiums.
net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, increased $21 million, or 5%, to $468 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $447 million for the prior year driven by higher average invested assets.
premiums increased $71 million, or 5%, to $1.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $1.3 billion for the prior year primarily due to a 3% increase in auto and home policies in force.

gains or losses, increased $4 million, or 1%, to $401 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $397 million for the prior year due to the impact of unlocking, partially offset by a $9 million unfavorable impact related to a reinsurance premium correction. other revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015 included a $5 million negative impact from unlocking compared to a $29 million negative impact in the prior year. the primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues in both periods was lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience.
expenses total expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related dac amortization) and the dac offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $160 million, or 8%, to $2.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $2.0 billion for the prior year primarily due to increases in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses and amortization of dac.
benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $122 million, or 9%, to $1.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $1.4 billion for the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:
•   a $106 million increase related to our auto and home business due to an increase in the provision for estimated losses reflecting the impact of growth in exposures due to a 3% increase in policies in force, higher 2015 accident year loss ratio assumptions and prior year development. in 2015, we increased our claims reserves $57 million primarily related to the 2014 and prior accident years auto liability coverages. this increase was driven by elevated frequency and severity experience for auto injury claims, as well as a lower than expected level of impact in improving the outcome of 2014 and prior accident year existing claims. auto and home losses for the prior year included a $30 million increase to prior accident year loss reserves resulting from adverse development in the 2013 and prior accident years auto liability coverage and a $60 million increase to loss reserves for estimated losses including ibnr claims resulting from further adverse loss development observed primarily in the 2014 auto book of business. catastrophe losses were $72 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $66 million for the prior year.
•   a $20 million increase in life insurance claims compared to the prior year primarily due to larger claims.
•   a $19 million increase in ltc claims compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in the number of open claims and an update in claim reserve assumptions partially offset by a higher interest rate used for ltc claims and the release of additional ltc reserves.
amortization of dac, which excludes the dac offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits and the dac offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $20 million, or 15%, to $155 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $135 million for the prior year primarily due to the impact of unlocking. amortization of dac for the year ended december 31, 2015 included a $10 million expense from unlocking primarily driven by the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment. amortization of dac for the prior year included a $9 million benefit from unlocking.

net investment income decreased $148 million, or 8%, to $1.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $1.9 billion for the prior year primarily due to a $96 million decrease in investment income on fixed maturities driven by low interest rates and a $63 million decrease in net investment income of cies, partially offset by a $30 million increase in net realized gains primarily related to calls on fixed income securities.
premiums increased $103 million, or 8%, to $1.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $1.3 billion for the prior year primarily due to growth in auto and home premiums driven by new policy sales growth, primarily from our affinity relationships with costco and progressive. auto and home policies in force increased 11% compared to the prior year.
other revenues increased $431 million, or 42%, to $1.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $1.0 billion for the prior year due to a $376 million increase in other revenues of cies and higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date, and higher average fee rates, partially offset by the impact of unlocking. other revenues for the year ended december 31, 2014 included a $29 million negative impact from unlocking compared to an $18 million negative impact in the prior year. the primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues in both periods was lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience.
expenses total expenses increased $492 million, or 5%, to $9.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $9.2 billion for the prior year primarily due to increases in distribution expenses and amortization of dac.
distribution expenses increased $311 million, or 11%, to $3.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $2.9 billion for the prior year driven by higher advisor compensation due to growth in average assets under management. see our discussion on the changes in aum in our segment results of operations section below.
interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $93 million, or 12%, to $713 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $806 million for the prior year driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances and a lower average crediting rate on interest sensitive fixed annuities. average fixed annuity account balances decreased $884 million, or 7%, to $12.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year due to net outflows reflecting elevated surrenders on products sold through third parties where rates have reset lower. the average fixed annuity crediting rate excluding capitalized interest decreased to 3.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 3.6% for the prior year reflecting the re-pricing of the five-year guarantee block. see additional discussion on the re-pricing in the annuities segment.
benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $28 million, or 1%, to $2.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:
•   the year ended december 31, 2014 included a $6 million expense from unlocking. the prior year included a $5 million benefit from unlocking, which included a $22 million benefit related to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. the
69
market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits is discussed below. the unlocking impact for the year ended december 31, 2014 reflected lower than previously assumed interest rates, partially offset by a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption. the unlocking impact for the year ended december 31, 2013 reflected lower than previously assumed interest rates and changes in assumed policyholder behavior, partially offset by the impact of variable annuity model changes.
•   a $163 million increase in provision for estimated losses related to our auto and home business reflecting the impact of growth in exposures from an 11% increase in policies in force, an increase in catastrophe losses reflecting the growth in exposures and the extremely severe winter and spring weather during 2014, and adverse development in the 2013 and prior accident years auto liability coverage observed during the first quarter of 2014 resulting in a $30 million increase to prior accident year loss reserves. later in 2014, further adverse loss development was observed primarily in the 2014 auto book of business which resulted in a $60 million increase to loss reserves for estimated losses including ibnr. catastrophe losses were $66 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $42 million for the prior year.
•   a $26 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.
•   a $21 million decrease in expenses compared to the prior year from policyholder movement of investments in portfolio navigator (traditional asset allocation) funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the portfolio stabilizer (managed volatility) funds. see additional discussion in the annuities segment.
•   a decrease in expense compared to the prior year due to an $8 million increase in disability income reserves in the second quarter of 2013 related to prior periods.
•   a $404 million decrease in expense compared to the prior year from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. as the embedded derivative liability on which the nonperformance credit spread is applied increases (decreases), the impact of the nonperformance credit spread is favorable (unfavorable) to expense. in 2014, the favorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $146 million primarily driven by an increase in the embedded derivative liability. in 2013, the unfavorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $258 million primarily driven by a decrease in the embedded derivative liability.
•   a $303 million increase in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related dsic amortization. this increase was the result of an unfavorable $2.9 billion change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves, a favorable $2.6 billion change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits and an unfavorable $2 million dsic offset. the main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:
•   interest rates were down in 2014 and up in 2013 resulting in an unfavorable change in the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability, partially offset by a favorable change in the related hedge assets.
•   equity market and volatility impacts on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the related hedge assets resulted in a benefit in 2014 compared to an expense in 2013.
•   other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a net favorable impact compared to the prior year.
amortization of dac increased $160 million, or 77%, to $367 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $207 million for the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:
•   amortization of dac for the year ended december 31, 2014 included an $8 million expense from unlocking, primarily driven by lower than previously assumed interest rates, partially offset by favorable persistency and mortality experience and a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption. amortization of dac for the year ended december 31, 2013 included a $79 million benefit from unlocking, which included a $5 million expense related to the dac offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, primarily driven by higher than previously assumed interest rates and changes in assumed policyholder behavior.
•   the dac offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related dsic amortization) was a benefit of $9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to a benefit of $34 million for the prior year.
•   a $7 million expense related to an actuarial model correction in life insurance in the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily related to prior periods.
•   the impact on dac from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $21 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to a benefit of $26 million for the prior year. equity market returns were favorable in both periods but less favorable in 2014 versus the prior year. bond fund returns were favorable in 2014 and unfavorable in the prior year.
70
interest and debt expense increased $47 million, or 17%, to $328 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $281 million for the prior year due to a $53 million increase in interest and debt expense of cies.
income taxes our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations including income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 21.4% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 25.0% for the prior year. our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations excluding income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 25.2% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 26.9% for the prior year. the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2014 was lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction and low income housing tax credits, as well as a $17 million benefit in 2014 related to the completion of an irs audit.
in december 2014, we received irs approval for a change in accounting method related to variable annuity hedging. accordingly, we began using the approved method of accounting in the fourth quarter of 2014. the change to the approved method increased deferred tax expense and current tax receivables with a corresponding decrease to current tax expense and deferred tax assets of approximately $300 million.

our asset management segment pretax operating earnings, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, increased $97 million, or 14%, to $788 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $691 million for the prior year reflecting higher average assets under management driven by equity market appreciation, partially offset by retail fund distributions and a $30 million gain on the sale of threadneedle's strategic business investment in cofunds in the prior year.
net revenues net revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, increased $151 million, or 5%, to $3.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $3.2 billion for the prior year driven by an increase in management and financial advice fees.
management and financial advice fees increased $148 million, or 6%, to $2.8 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $2.6 billion for the prior year primarily due to an increase in assets under management. average assets under management increased 7% compared to the prior year primarily driven by equity market appreciation, partially offset by retail fund distributions. see our discussion above on the changes in assets under management.
distribution fees increased $24 million, or 5%, to $493 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $469 million for the prior year primarily due to higher assets levels due to market appreciation, partially offset by retail fund distributions.
net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $24 million, or 44%, to $30 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $54 million for the prior year due to a $30 million gain on the sale of threadneedle's investment in cofunds in the prior year.
expenses total expenses increased $54 million, or 2%, to $2.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year primarily due to a $36 million increase in distribution expenses driven by higher average retail fund assets and an $18 million increase in general and administrative expense primarily driven by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and investments in the business. the negative impact of foreign exchanges rates on expenses was more than offset by the positive impact to revenues.

our annuities segment pretax operating income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses (net of the related dsic and dac amortization) and the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related dsic and dac amortization), increased $4 million, or 1%, to $633 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $629 million for the prior year primarily due to market appreciation, as well as a benefit from policyholder movement of investments in portfolio navigator funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the portfolio stabilizer funds, partially offset by the impact of unlocking. the impact of unlocking was a decrease to pretax operating income of $22 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to an increase of $60 million for the prior year.
during the fourth quarter of 2013, we added portfolio stabilizer fund options for our in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees. these additional investment options resulted in sizable asset movement into the managed volatility funds. the resulting earnings benefit for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $44 million compared to a benefit of $26 million in the prior year.
riversource variable annuity account balances increased 2% to $77.0 billion at december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $1.7 billion.
riversource fixed annuity account balances declined 8% to $12.1 billion at december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year reflecting elevated surrenders on products sold through third parties where crediting rates have reset lower. the change in crediting rates decreased the level of spread compression for the year ended december 31, 2014. all of the five-year guarantee block totaling $4.1 billion was re-priced as of december 31, 2014.
net revenues net revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, increased $30 million, or 1%, to $2.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in management and financial advice fees and other revenues partially offset by a decrease in net investment income.
management and financial advice fees increased $47 million, or 7%, to $756 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $709 million for the prior year due to higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher separate account balances. average variable annuity account balances increased $4.4 billion, or 7%, from the prior year due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows.
distribution fees increased $21 million, or 6%, to $360 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $339 million for the prior year primarily due to higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher separate account balances.

net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $95 million, or 9%, to $941 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $1.0 billion for the prior year primarily reflecting a decrease of approximately $39 million from lower invested assets due to fixed annuity net outflows and approximately $63 million from lower interest rates.
other revenues increased $58 million, or 16%, to $425 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $367 million for the prior year due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates.
expenses total expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related dsic and dac amortization) and the dac and dsic offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $26 million, or 1%, to $2.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $1.9 billion for the prior year primarily due to an increase in amortization of dac, partially offset by a decrease in interest credited to fixed accounts and benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses.
distribution expenses increased $19 million, or 5%, to $439 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $420 million for the prior year primarily due to higher variable annuity compensation driven by higher variable annuity contract values.
interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $97 million, or 15%, to $556 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $653 million for the prior year driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances and a lower average crediting rate on interest sensitive fixed annuities. average fixed annuity account balances decreased $884 million, or 7%, to $12.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year due to net outflows reflecting elevated surrenders on products sold through third parties where rates have reset lower. the average fixed annuity crediting rate excluding capitalized interest decreased to 3.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 3.6% for the prior year reflecting the re-pricing of the five-year guarantee block.
benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related dsic amortization) and the dsic offset to net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $35 million, or 7%, to $463 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $498 million for the prior year primarily due to a $21 million decrease in expense related to the benefit from policyholder movement of investments in portfolio navigator funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the portfolio stabilizer funds and the impact of unlocking, partially offset by an increase in expense of $26 million related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date. benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014 included a $5 million expense from unlocking primarily reflecting lower than previously assumed interest rates, partially offset by a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption. benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses for the year ended december 31, 2013 included a $21 million expense from unlocking primarily reflecting the impact of variable annuity model changes.
amortization of dac, which excludes the dac offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits and the dac offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $124 million to $235 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $111 million for the prior year primarily due to the impact of unlocking. amortization of dac for the year ended december 31, 2014 included a $17 million expense from unlocking primarily driven by lower than previously assumed interest rates, partially offset by favorable persistency and mortality experience and a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption. amortization of dac for the year ended december 31, 2013 included an $81 million benefit from unlocking primarily driven by higher than previously assumed interest rates and changes in assumed policyholder behavior.

fair value measurements we report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, embedded derivatives, properties held by our consolidated property funds, and most investments and cash equivalents. fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. we include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. we validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our fair value measurements.
fair value of liabilities and nonperformance risk companies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). since there is not a market for our obligations of our variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. as a result, we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for profit, risk and expenses, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. the nonperformance risk adjustment is based on observable market data adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the libor swap curve as of december 31, 2015. as our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. if this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the libor swap curve, the reduction to net income would be approximately $220 million, net of dac, dsic, unearned revenue amortization, the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 35%), based on december 31, 2015 credit spreads.
liquidity and capital resources overview we maintained substantial liquidity during the year ended december 31, 2015. at december 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents. we have additional liquidity available through an unsecured revolving credit facility for up to $500 million that expires in may 2020. under the terms of the credit agreement, we can increase this facility to $750 million upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. at december 31, 2015, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $1 million of outstanding letters of credit. our junior subordinated notes due 2066 and credit facility contain various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. we were in compliance with all such covenants at december 31, 2015.
in 2015, we extinguished $49 million of our junior subordinated notes due 2066 in open market transactions and recognized a gain of less than $1 million. in november 2015, we used cash on hand to fund the repayment of $350 million of our senior notes.
we enter into short-term borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements and federal home loan bank ("fhlb") advances, to reduce reinvestment risk. short-term borrowings allow us to receive cash to reinvest in longer-duration assets, while paying back the short-term debt with cash flows generated by the fixed income portfolio. the balance of repurchase agreements at both december 31, 2015 and 2014 was $50 million, which is collateralized with agency residential mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities from our investment portfolio. our subsidiary, riversource life insurance company ("riversource life"), is a member of the fhlb of des moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. as of both december 31, 2015 and 2014, we had borrowings of $150 million from the fhlb, which is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities. we believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and our availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs.
dividends from subsidiaries ameriprise financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly owned subsidiaries. because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, riversource life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, ameriprise certificate company ("acc"), ampf holding corporation, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, ameriprise financial services, inc. ("afsi") and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, american enterprise investment services, inc. ("aeis"), our auto and home insurance subsidiary, ids property casualty insurance company ("ids property casualty"), doing business as ameriprise auto & home insurance, our transfer agent subsidiary, columbia management investment services corp., our investment advisory company, columbia management investment advisers, llc, and threadneedle asset management holdings sàrl. the payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements.

cash flows cash flows of cies are reflected in our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. cash held by cies is not available for general use by ameriprise financial, nor is ameriprise financial cash available for general use by its cies. as such, the operating, investing and financing cash flows of the cies have no impact to the change in cash and cash equivalents.
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased $173 million to $2.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $2.4 billion for the prior year primarily due to a $118 million increase in cash from changes in other investments primarily related to trading securities and a $139 million reduction of income taxes paid, net, partially offset by a $67 million increase in interest paid on cie debt.
net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.0 billion to $2.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $1.4 billion for the prior year primarily due to an $861 million increase in cash flows related to investment properties of cies due to lower purchases and higher sales of investment properties and an increase in cash from changes in our freestanding derivatives and related collateral, as well as an increase in fee revenue partially offset by related expenses and a $187 million increase in income taxes paid, net.
investing activities our investing activities primarily relate to our available-for-sale investment portfolio. further, this activity is significantly affected by the net flows of our investment certificate, fixed annuity and universal life products reflected in financing activities.
net cash used in investing activities decreased $201 million to $514 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $715 million for the prior year primarily reflecting a $520 million decrease in purchases of investments by cies and a $131 million increase in cash flows related to other investments, partially offset by a $435 million increase in purchases of available-for sale securities.
net cash used in investing activities decreased $87 million to $715 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $802 million for the prior year primarily due to a $1.7 billion decrease in cash used for purchases of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by a $560 million decrease in proceeds from sales and maturities, sinking fund payments and calls of available-for-sale securities, a $587 million decrease in proceeds from sales, maturities and repayments of investments by cies and a $121 million increase in purchases of investments by cies.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities increased $661 million to $2.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $1.7 billion for the prior year. net cash inflows related to investment certificates increased $407 million compared to the prior year due to higher proceeds from additions, partially offset by higher maturities, withdrawals and cash surrenders. cash outflows from surrenders and other benefits of policyholder account balances increased $274 million compared to the prior year primarily reflecting
84
higher lapse rates. cash outflows related to the repayment of long-term debt increased $209 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the maturity of our senior notes in 2015. cash flows for the prior year reflected a $543 million increase in cash from issuance of our unsecured senior notes due october 2024 and a $300 million decrease in cash related to short-term borrowings as we reduced our borrowings from the fhlb. cash outflows related to the repurchase of common shares increased $164 million compared to the prior year. net cash inflows related to changes in debt of cies decreased $217 million compared to the prior year due to a decrease in borrowings of cies, partially offset by lower repayments of debt of cies.
net cash used in financing activities increased $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $306 million for the prior year. cash outflows from policyholder account balances increased $662 million compared to the prior year primarily due to higher surrenders and other benefits. net cash inflows related to investment certificates decreased $248 million compared to the prior year due to higher maturities, withdrawals and cash surrenders partially offset by higher proceeds from additions. cash outflows from changes in short-term borrowings increased $299 million compared to the prior year as we reduced our borrowings from the fhlb during the year ended december 31, 2014.
contractual commitments the contractual obligations identified in the table below include both our on and off-balance sheet transactions that represent material expected or contractually committed future obligations. the table excludes obligations of cies as they are not direct obligations of the company and have recourse only to the assets of the cies. payments due by period as of december 31, 2015 were as follows:

(1) see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for more information about our long-term debt. amounts include obligations under capital leases.
(2) these scheduled payments are represented by reserves of approximately $28.8 billion at december 31, 2015 and are based on interest credited, mortality, morbidity, lapse, surrender and premium payment assumptions. actual payment obligations may differ if experience varies from these assumptions. separate account liabilities have been excluded as associated contractual obligations would be met by separate account assets.
(3) the payments due by year are based on contractual term maturities. however, contractholders have the right to redeem the investment certificates earlier and at their discretion subject to surrender charges, if any. redemptions are most likely to occur in periods of substantial increases in interest rates.
(4) the fair value of these commitments included on the consolidated balance sheets was $1.8 billion as of december 31, 2015. see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for more information about our deferred premium options.
(5) affordable housing partnership commitments are related to investments in low income housing tax credit partnerships. call dates for the obligations presented are either date or event specific. for date specific obligations, we are required to fund a specific amount on a stated date provided there are no defaults under the agreement. for event specific obligations, we are required to fund a specific amount of its capital commitment when properties in a fund become fully stabilized. for event specific obligations, the estimated call date of these commitments is used in the table above.
(6) purchase obligations include the minimum contractual amounts by period under contracts that were in effect at december 31, 2015. many of the purchase agreements giving rise to these purchase obligations include termination clauses that may require payment of termination fees if the agreements are terminated by us without cause prior to their stated expiration; however, the table reflects the amounts to be paid assuming the contracts are not terminated.
(7) interest on long-term debt was estimated based on rates in effect as of december 31, 2015.
in addition to the contractual commitments outlined in the table above, we periodically fund the employees' defined benefit plans. we contributed $45 million and $42 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, to our pension plans. in 2016, we expect to contribute $23 million to our pension plans and $2 million to our defined benefit postretirement plans. see note 22 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
total loan funding commitments, which are not included in the table above due to uncertainty with respect to timing of future cash flows, were $523 million at december 31, 2015.
for additional information relating to these contractual commitments, see note 23 to our consolidated financial statements.

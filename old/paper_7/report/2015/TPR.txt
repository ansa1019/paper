item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of coach's financial condition and results of operations should be read together with coach's consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements, included elsewhere in this document. when used herein, the terms "company," "coach," "we," "us" and "our" refer to coach, inc., including consolidated subsidiaries. unless the context requires otherwise, references to the "coach brand" do not include the stuart weitzman brand and references to the "stuart weitzman brand" do not include the coach brand.
executive overview coach, inc. is a leading new york design house of modern luxury accessories and lifestyle brands. the coach brand was established in new york city in 1941, and has a rich heritage of pairing exceptional leathers and materials with innovative design.
coach, inc. operates in three segments: north america, international and other (which includes the stuart weitzman brand acquired by the company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015). the north america segment includes sales to north american customers through coach-operated stores (including the internet) and sales to north american wholesale customers. the international segment includes sales to customers through coach-operated stores (including the internet) and concession shop-in-shops in japan and mainland china, coach-operated stores and concession shop-in-shops in hong kong, macau, singapore, taiwan, malaysia, south korea, the united kingdom, france, ireland, spain, portugal, germany, italy, belgium and the netherlands, as well as sales to wholesale customers and distributors in approximately 45 countries. other, consists of sales and expenses generated by the coach brand in other ancillary channels, including licensing and disposition. other also consists of sales and expenses generated by the stuart weitzman brand during the final two months of fiscal 2015. as the company's business model is based on multi-channel global distribution, our success does not depend solely on the performance of a single channel or geographic area.
in order to drive growth within our global business, we are focused on four key initiatives, which directly align with the coach brand transformation plan, described below:
•   grow our business in north america and worldwide, by transforming from a leading international accessories company into a global lifestyle brand, anchored in luxury accessories.
•   leverage the global opportunity for coach by raising brand awareness and building market share in markets where coach is under-penetrated, most notably in asia and europe. we are also developing the brand opportunity as we expand into south america and central america.
•   focus on the men's opportunity for the brand, by drawing on our long heritage in the category. we are capitalizing on this opportunity by opening new standalone and dual gender stores and broadening the men's assortment in existing stores.
•   harness the growing power of the digital world, by accelerating the development of our digital programs and capabilities in north america and worldwide, reflecting the change in consumer shopping behavior globally. our intent is to rapidly drive further innovation to engage with customers in this channel. key elements include www.coach.com, our invitation-only outlet internet site, our global e-commerce sites, marketing sites and social media.
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, coach, inc. announced a multi-year strategic plan with the objective of transforming the coach brand and reinvigorating growth, which we believe will enable the company to return to 'best-in-class' profitability. this multi-faceted, multi-year transformation plan (the "transformation plan") builds on the core brand equities of quality and craftsmanship with the aim of evolving our competitive value proposition. we believe our strategy offers significant growth opportunities in handbags and accessories, as well as in the broader set of lifestyle categories that we have operated in for some time but are less developed, including footwear and ready-to-wear. this strategy has required an integrated holistic approach, across product, stores and marketing and promotional activities, and entails the roll-out of carefully crafted aspirational marketing campaigns to define the coach brand and to deliver a fuller and more consistent brand expression.
key operational and cost measures of the transformation plan include: (i) the investment in capital improvements in our stores and wholesale locations to drive comparable sales improvement; (ii) the optimization and streamlining of our organizational model as well as the closure of underperforming stores in north america, and select international stores; (iii) the realignment of inventory levels and mix to reflect our elevated product strategy and consumer preferences; (iv) the investment of approximately $50 million in incremental advertising costs to elevate consumer perception of our coach brand, drives sales growth and promote our new strategy, which started in fiscal 2015; and (v) the significant scale-back of our promotional cadence in an increased global promotional environment, particularly within our outlet internet sales site, which began in fiscal 2014. the company's execution of these key operational and cost measures were on plan through the end of fiscal 2015, and we believe that long-term
29
growth can be realized through these transformational efforts over time. for further discussion of charges incurred in connection with the transformation plan, see "items affecting comparability," herein.
furthermore, as discussed in note 7, "acquisitions," the company acquired luxury designer footwear brand stuart weitzman, which we believe will complement our current leadership position in premium handbags and accessories, while immediately adding to the company's earnings as we continue to make meaningful progress towards our brand transformation. the acquisition was consummated on may 4, 2015, and the brand contributed $43.0 million in net sales in fiscal 2015, included within our other segment.
current trends and outlook in addition to the risks surrounding the successful execution of our transformation plan initiatives, our outlook reflects a certain level of uncertainty surrounding the global economy. the global economic environment continues to have an impact on consumer confidence, which in turn influences the level of spending on discretionary items. global consumer retail traffic remained relatively weak and inconsistent, which has led to a more promotional environment in the fragmented retail industry due to increased competition and a desire to offset traffic declines with increased levels of conversion. macroeconomic and geopolitical events in greater china and southeast asia have contributed to volatility in consumer spending within the region. furthermore, it is still too early to understand the impact, if any, of mers (middle east respiratory syndrome) on consumer spending in asia, including the impact on tourism in the region.
within the u.s., a prolonged and tough winter season impacted demand during the first half of calendar 2015, however certain limited and recent factors within the u.s., including an improvement in the labor market and modest growth in overall consumer spending, suggest a potential moderate strengthening in the u.s. economic outlook. it is still, however, too early to understand what kind of sustained impact this will have on consumer discretionary spending. if the global macroeconomic environment remains volatile or worsens, the constrained level of worldwide consumer spending and modified consumption behavior may continue to have a negative effect on our outlook.
we will continue to monitor these risks and trends and evaluate and adjust our operating strategies and cost management opportunities to mitigate the related impact on our results of operations, while remaining focused on the long-term growth of our business and protecting the value of our brands.
as discussed in part i, item 1 - "business" and as part of our transformation plan as described in note 3, "transformation and other actions," in fiscal 2015, we have reduced the number of retail stores and total square footage within north america, as we continue to optimize our real estate position. we expect this trend to continue in the next fiscal year with the anticipated closure of approximately 15-20 north america retail stores in fiscal 2016, attributable to our transformation plan. we expect to continue to see modest to no growth in north america outlet store square footage as we continue to optimize our real estate position across channels by expanding our most productive stores to accommodate a broader expression of lifestyle assortment while continuing to assess opportunities to close under-performing stores. within our international segment, we are expecting to reflect modest growth in our store count over the next few years, particularly within mainland china and europe. lastly, within stuart weitzman, we are expecting modest growth in our real estate position over the next year.
for a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, see part i, item 1a - "risk factors" included in this annual report on form 10-k.

summary - fiscal 2015
in fiscal 2015, coach, inc. reported net sales of $4.19 billion (including $43.0 million attributable to the stuart weitzman brand), net income of $402.4 million and net income per diluted share of $1.45. this compares to net sales of $4.81 billion, net income of $781.3 million, and net income per diluted share of $2.79 in fiscal 2014.
in fiscal 2015, the comparability of our operating results has been affected by $145.9 million of pretax charges ($107.8 million after tax, or $0.39 per diluted share) related to our transformation plan, $24.6 million of pretax charges ($21.0 million after tax, or $0.08 per diluted share) related to acquisition charges associated with the stuart weitzman brand. these fiscal 2015 actions taken together increased the company's selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expenses by $160.8 million and cost of sales by $9.7 million, negatively impacting net income by $128.8 million, or $0.47 per diluted share.
in fiscal 2014, the comparability of our operating results was affected by $131.5 million of pretax charges ($88.3 million after tax or $0.31 per diluted share) related to our transformation plan. these fiscal 2014 actions increased the company's sg&a expenses by $49.3 million and cost of sales by $82.2 million, negatively impacting net income by $88.3 million, or $0.31 per diluted share.
our operating performance for fiscal 2015 reflected a decline in net sales of 12.8%, primarily due to our north america business partially offset by a $43.0 million contribution from the stuart weitzman brand. excluding the effects of foreign currency, net sales decreased 10.6%. our gross profit decreased by 11.8% to $2.91 billion during fiscal 2015 which included the negative impact of charges under our transformation plan of $5.0 million and stuart weitzman purchase accounting related items of $4.7 million. excluding our transformation plan and acquisition-related charges in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, gross profit decreased by 13.6%, to $2.92 billion. sg&a expenses increased by 5.2% to $2.29 billion during fiscal 2015. excluding charges under our transformation plan and acquisition-related charges in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, sg&a expenses remained fairly consistent.
net income decreased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, due to a decrease in operating income of $502.1 million, partially offset by a $131.8 million decrease in our provision for income taxes. net income per diluted share decreased primarily due to lower net income. excluding charges under our transformation plan and acquisition-related charges in fiscal 2015 and charges under our transformation plan in fiscal 2014, net income and net income per diluted share decreased 38.9% and 38.2%, respectively.

items affecting comparability fiscal 2015 items in fiscal 2015, the company incurred charges as follows:
•   $145.9 million under our transformation plan due to accelerated depreciation and lease termination charges as a result of store updates and closures, organizational efficiency charges, and charges related to the destruction of inventory, within north america and select international stores;
•   $17.1 million primarily related to acquisition charges of $14.2 million associated with the stuart weitzman brand, and to a lesser extent, charges attributable to the contingent earn out payment of the acquisition; and
•   $7.5 million related to the short-term impact of purchase accounting, primarily due to the amortization of the fair value of the inventory step-up and order backlog asset.
these fiscal 2015 actions taken together increased the company's sg&a expenses by $160.8 million and cost of sales by $9.7 million, negatively impacting net income by $128.8 million, or $0.47 per diluted share. refer to the "executive overview" herein and note 3, "transformation and other actions," for further information regarding the transformation plan.
additional actions under our transformation plan will continue into fiscal 2016, with expected incremental charges of around $50 million.

fiscal 2014 items in fiscal 2014, the company incurred restructuring and transformation related charges of $131.5 million under its transformation plan as announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. the charges recorded in cost of sales and sg&a expenses were $82.2 million and $49.3 million, respectively. these charges, which were primarily associated with our north america business, relate to inventory and fleet related costs, including impairment, accelerated depreciation and severance related to store closures.
currency fluctuation effects the change in net sales in fiscal 2015 has been presented both including and excluding currency fluctuation effects (primarily attributable to coach japan).
net sales net sales decreased 12.8% or $614.6 million to $4.19 billion in fiscal 2015. excluding the effects of foreign currency, net sales decreased 10.6% or $511.3 million. this decrease was driven by lower sales in the north america business partially offset by gains in the international business, and a $43.0 million contribution due to the acquisition of stuart weitzman. the following table presents net sales by reportable segment for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014:

comparable store sales measure sales performance at stores that have been open for at least 12 months, and includes sales from the internet. coach excludes new locations from the comparable store base for the first twelve months of operation. comparable store sales have not been adjusted for store expansions.
north america net sales decreased 20.4% or $633.0 million to $2.47 billion in fiscal 2015. excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency due to the canadian dollar, net sales decreased $622.5 million or 20.1%. this decrease was primarily driven by lower comparable store sales of $613.4 million or 22%, due to lower traffic as a result of a decrease in promotional activity, partially offset by higher transaction size. the internet business had a negative impact of approximately 740 basis points on comparable store sales which is attributable to the company's decision to both limit access and reduce the promotional cadence on our outlet internet sales site. north america sales were also negatively impacted by lower wholesale sales of approximately $53.9 million due to lower shipments. these decreases were partially offset by a net increase of $32.4 million related to net sales generated by new store openings which were partially offset by the absence of net sales for those stores that have closed since fiscal 2014. since the end of fiscal 2014, coach closed a net 74 retail stores and a net three outlet stores, including the closure of 11 men's outlet stores.
international net sales decreased 1.3% or $22.2 million to $1.62 billion in fiscal 2015. excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, primarily due to the japanese yen, net sales increased $70.8 million or 4.3%. this increase was primarily due to growth in greater china (which includes hong kong and macau) reflecting an increase of $50.5 million primarily due to net new stores and positive comparable store sales, an increase of $36.7 million related to net new store openings and positive comparable store sales of our business in europe and an increase of $15.7 million in our international wholesale business partially due to higher shipments. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales in japan of $37.4 million due to lower traffic as a result of lapping the pull forward in demand in advance of the april 2014 consumption tax increase. since the end of fiscal 2014, we opened 28 net new stores, with 16 net new stores in mainland china, hong kong and macau and japan, and 12 net new stores in the other regions.
other net sales increased 66.0% or $40.6 million to $102.1 million, primarily due to the impact of the stuart weitzman acquisition.

gross profit gross profit decreased 11.8% or $388.4 million to $2.91 billion in fiscal 2015 from $3.30 billion in fiscal 2014. gross margin for fiscal 2015 was 69.4% as compared to 68.6% in fiscal 2014. excluding items affecting comparability of $9.7 million in fiscal 2015 and $82.2 million in fiscal 2014, gross profit decreased 13.6% or $460.9 million to $2.92 billion from $3.38 billion in fiscal 2014, and gross margin was 69.6% in fiscal 2015 as compared to 70.3% in fiscal 2014. excluding items affecting comparability, the gross margin decreased 70 basis points, as described below.
north america gross profit decreased 21.0% or $418.1 million to $1.57 billion in fiscal 2015. gross margin decreased 50 basis points from 64.3% in fiscal 2014 to 63.8% in fiscal 2015. the decrease in gross margin is primarily attributable to the impact of decreased promotional activity on an elevated product assortment. specifically, the impact of a higher mix of elevated product sales primarily in our outlet stores, which contained higher average unit costs, negatively impacted gross margin by 120 basis points. this decrease was mostly offset by lower promotional activity, mainly as a result of the scale-back of promotional events within our outlet channel which favorably impacted gross margin by 90 basis points.
international gross profit decreased 3.6% or $46.5 million to $1.25 billion in fiscal 2015. gross margin decreased 180 basis points from 78.8% in fiscal 2014 to 77.0% in fiscal 2015. the decrease in gross margin is primarily due to a less favorable geographic mix of our sales and unfavorable effects of foreign currency, which in aggregate negatively impacted gross margin by 110 basis points, particularly as a result of a decline in net sales in japan, coupled with the growth of our international wholesale business, as well as the impact of stronger elevated product sales which carry higher average unit costs, negatively impacting gross margin by 60 basis points and to a lesser extent increased promotional activity.
other gross profit increased 57.2% or $21.1 million to $58.0 million in fiscal 2015. this increase is substantially attributable to the acquisition of the stuart weitzman brand during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
corporate unallocated gross profit increased $55.1 million from a loss of $27.9 million in fiscal 2014 to a profit of $27.2 million in fiscal 2015. excluding items affecting comparability of $9.7 million in fiscal 2015 and $82.2 million in fiscal 2014, corporate unallocated gross profit decreased by $17.4 million from $54.3 million in fiscal 2014 to $36.9 million in fiscal 2015, primarily due to increased inventory reserves and less favorable production variances.
selling, general and administrative expenses sg&a expenses are comprised of four categories: (i) selling; (ii) advertising, marketing and design; (iii) distribution and customer service; and (iv) administrative. selling expenses include store employee compensation, occupancy costs and supply costs, wholesale and retail account administration compensation globally and international operating expenses. these expenses are affected by the number of company-operated stores open during any fiscal period and store performance, as compensation and rent expenses vary with sales. advertising, marketing and design expenses include employee compensation, media space and production, advertising agency fees, new product design costs, public relations and market research expenses. distribution and customer service expenses include warehousing, order fulfillment, shipping and handling, customer service, employee compensation and bag repair costs. administrative expenses include compensation costs for "corporate" functions including: executive, finance, human resources, legal and information systems departments, as well as corporate headquarters occupancy costs, consulting fees and software expenses. administrative expenses also include global equity compensation expense.
the company includes inbound product-related transportation costs from our service providers within cost of sales. the company, similar to some companies, includes certain transportation-related costs related to our distribution network in selling, general and administrative expenses rather than in cost of sales; for this reason, our gross margins may not be comparable to that of entities that include all costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales.
sg&a expenses increased 5.2% or $113.7 million to $2.29 billion in fiscal 2015 as compared to $2.18 billion in fiscal 2014. as a percentage of net sales, sg&a expenses increased to 54.6% during fiscal 2015 as compared to 45.3% during fiscal 2014. excluding items affecting comparability of $160.8 million in fiscal 2015 and $49.3 million in fiscal 2014, sg&a expenses increased $2.2 million from fiscal 2014; and sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales increased, due to deleveraging as net sales have declined, to 50.8% in fiscal 2015 from 44.3% in fiscal 2014.
selling expenses were $1.53 billion, or 36.6% of net sales, in fiscal 2015 compared to $1.55 billion, or 32.2% of net sales, in fiscal 2014. the $16.5 million decrease represents slightly lower selling expenses related to our north america stores and internet business, which were partially offset by increases to support growth in our international business (primarily in europe and greater china) as well as incremental stuart weitzman selling expenses. excluding items affecting comparability of $4.1 million in fiscal 2015, selling expenses were 36.5% of net sales.
advertising, marketing, and design costs were $246.8 million, or 5.9% of net sales, in fiscal 2015, compared to $242.3 million, or 5.0% of net sales, during fiscal 2014. the increase was the result of higher costs for marketing-related events which increased by $28.8 million as compared to fiscal 2014, partially offset by fewer promotional events made by the company, primarily as a result of the company's decision to limit access to our outlet internet sales site.
34
distribution and consumer service expenses were $69.6 million, or 1.7% of net sales, in fiscal 2015, compared to fiscal 2014 expenses of $87.2 million, or 1.8% of net sales. the decrease was primarily due to lower variable costs as a result of lower sales associated with the company's decision to limit access to our outlet internet sales site.
administrative expenses were $441.5 million, or 10.5% of net sales, in fiscal 2015 compared to $300.5 million, or 6.3% of net sales, during fiscal 2014. excluding items affecting comparability of $156.7 million in fiscal 2015 and $49.3 million in fiscal 2014, administrative expenses were $284.8 million, or 6.8% of net sales, in fiscal 2015 and $251.2 million, or 5.2% of net sales, in fiscal 2014. the increase is primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs and additional costs incurred particularly related to information technology.
operating income operating income decreased 44.8% or $502.1 million to $618.0 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to $1.12 billion in fiscal 2014. operating margin decreased to 14.7% as compared to 23.3% in fiscal 2014. excluding items affecting comparability of $170.5 million in fiscal 2015 and $131.5 million in fiscal 2014, operating income decreased 37.0% or $463.1 million to $788.5 million from $1.25 billion in fiscal 2014; and operating margin was 18.8%, in fiscal 2015 as compared to 26.0% in fiscal 2014.

north america operating income decreased 29.5% or $343.6 million to $820.5 million in fiscal 2015 reflecting the decrease in gross profit of $418.1 million which was partially offset by lower sg&a expenses of $74.5 million. the decrease in sg&a expenses was due to lower variable selling costs as a result of lower sales in our stores and internet business. operating margin decreased 420 basis points to 33.3% in fiscal 2015 from 37.5% during the same period in the prior year due to higher sg&a expense as a percentage of net sales of 390 basis points, primarily due to deleveraging of selling expenses as net sales have declined, and lower gross margin of 50 basis points.
international operating income decreased 13.5% or $75.1 million to $480.6 million in fiscal 2015, primarily reflecting a decrease in gross profit of $46.5 million as well as higher sg&a expenses of $28.6 million. the increase in sg&a expenses is related to a $30.8 million increase in greater china and asia, excluding japan, related to new store openings and a $24.9 million increase in europe to support growth in the business. the increase in sg&a costs were partially offset by foreign currency effects in japan of $32.2 million. operating margin decreased 420 basis points to 29.6% in fiscal 2015 from 33.8% during the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher overall sg&a as a percentage of net sales which increased by 240 basis points and lower gross margin of 180 basis points.
corporate unallocated operating expense increased $74.7 million to $708.6 million in fiscal 2015, an increase of 11.8%. this increase was primarily attributable to higher charges incurred by the company in fiscal 2015 as part of its transformation plan. excluding items affecting comparability, unallocated operating expenses increased by 8.9% or $44.6 million to $547.0 million from $502.4 million. this increase is primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs and additional costs incurred particularly related to information technology.

provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was 34.2% in fiscal 2015, as compared to 30.4% in fiscal 2014. excluding the items affecting comparability, the effective tax rate was 32.1% in fiscal 2015, as compared to 30.6% in fiscal 2014. the increase in our effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the loss of certain foreign tax benefits that expired at the end of fiscal 2014, as well as the acquisition-related impact attributable to stuart weitzman. we expect our rate to be lower in fiscal 2016 primarily attributable to the geographic mix of earnings, the expiration of certain statutes, the settlement of audits and the ongoing benefit of available foreign tax credits.
net income net income decreased 48.5% or $378.9 million to $402.4 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to $781.3 million in fiscal 2014. excluding items of comparability, net income decreased 38.9% or $338.4 million to $531.2 million in fiscal 2015 from $869.6 million in fiscal 2014. this decrease was primarily due to lower operating income partially offset by lower provision for income taxes.
earnings per share net income per diluted share decreased 47.9% to $1.45 in fiscal 2015 as compared to $2.79 in fiscal 2014. excluding items of comparability, net income per diluted share decreased 38.2% or $1.18 to $1.92 in fiscal 2015 from $3.10 in fiscal 2014, due to lower net income.

items affecting comparability fiscal 2014 items in fiscal 2014, the company incurred restructuring and transformation related charges of $131.5 million under its transformation plan announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. the charges recorded in cost of sales and sg&a expenses were $82.2 million and $49.3 million, respectively. these charges, which are primarily associated with our north america business, relate to inventory and fleet related costs, including impairment, accelerated depreciation and severance related to store closures.
fiscal 2013 items in fiscal 2013, the company incurred restructuring and transformation related charges of $53.2 million. the charges recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and cost of sales were $48.4 million and $4.8 million, respectively. the charges include the strategic reassessment of the reed krakoff business, streamlining our organizational model and reassessing the fleet of our retail stores and inventories.

net sales net sales decreased 5.3% or $269.2 million to $4.81 billion in fiscal 2014. excluding the effects of foreign currency, net sales decreased 3.1% or $155.9 million. the decrease was driven by lower sales in the north america business partially offset by gains in the international business. the following table presents net sales by reportable segment for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013:

(1)   in connection with the acquisition of the retail business in europe, the company evaluated the composition of its reportable segments and concluded that sales in this region should be included in the international segment. accordingly, prior year comparable sales have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. see note 7, "acquisitions" and note 16, "segment information" for more information.
(2)   net sales in the other category consisted of sales generated in ancillary channels, including licensing and disposition.
comparable store sales measure sales performance at stores that have been open for at least 12 months, and includes sales from the internet. coach excludes new locations from the comparable store base for the first twelve months of operation. comparable store sales have not been adjusted for store expansions given our planned capital investments in connection with the transformation plan.
north america net sales decreased 10.9% or $377.7 million to $3.10 billion in fiscal 2014. this decrease was primarily driven by lower comparable store sales of $460.5 million or 15% largely due to lower traffic, and lower wholesale sales of $26.1 million due to lower shipments. the internet business had a negative impact, of over 1%, on comparable store sales which is attributable to the company's decision to eliminate third-party internet events and to limit access to our outlet internet sales site. this decrease was partially offset by an increase of $143.5 million related to net new stores. in fiscal 2014, coach opened a net 14 outlet stores, including one men's outlet store, and closed a net 19 retail stores.
international net sales increased 5.5% or $86.1 million to $1.64 billion in fiscal 2014. excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, primarily due to the japanese yen, net sales increased $191.0 million or 12.3%. the increase in net sales was primarily due to double digit growth in greater china and asia, excluding japan, reflecting an increase of $152.4 million due to net new stores and positive comparable store sales, as well as a $40.5 million increase related to the acquisition of the europe joint venture in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. in fiscal 2014, excluding the impact of acquisitions, we opened 39 net new stores, with 34 net new stores in mainland china, hong kong and macau and japan, and five net new stores in the other regions. the acquisition of the european joint venture resulted in a transfer of an additional 18 stores to the company's direct control. after the acquisition on july 1, 2013, coach opened seven new stores and transitioned two stores from wholesale to direct control in fiscal 2014.
gross profit gross profit decreased 10.8% or $401.1 million to $3.30 billion in fiscal 2014 from $3.70 billion in fiscal 2013. gross margin for fiscal 2014 was 68.6% as compared to 72.9% in fiscal 2013. excluding items affecting comparability of $82.2 million in fiscal 2014 and $4.8 million in fiscal 2013, gross profit decreased 8.7% or $323.7 million to $3.38 billion from $3.70 billion in fiscal 2013, and gross margin was 70.3% in fiscal 2014 as compared to 73.0% in fiscal 2013.
north america gross profit decreased 15.1% or $353.1 million to $1.99 billion in fiscal 2014. gross margin decreased 310 basis points from 67.4% in fiscal 2013 to 64.3% in fiscal 2014. the decrease in gross margin is due to a 210 basis point decline as a result of increased promotional activity, primarily in our outlet channel, and a 70 basis point decline as a result of selling products with a higher average unit cost as well as increased penetration of our broadened lifestyle categories.
international gross profit increased 3.2% or $40.0 million to $1.30 billion in fiscal 2014. gross margin decreased 180 basis points from 80.6% in fiscal 2013 to 78.8% in fiscal 2014. the decrease in gross margin is primarily due to the negative translation effect of changes in foreign currency, primarily associated with fluctuations in the japanese yen. other factors negatively impacting gross margin were increased promotions, selling products with a higher average unit cost, as well as increased penetration of our
38
broadened lifestyle categories which were partially offset by the lower step-up of inventory as part of the purchase accounting related to our acquisitions.
corporate unallocated gross profit decreased $92.6 million from $64.7 million in fiscal 2013 to a loss of $27.9 million in fiscal 2014. excluding items affecting comparability of $82.2 million in fiscal 2014 and $4.8 million in fiscal 2013, gross profit decreased by $15.2 million from $69.5 million to $54.3 million in fiscal 2014, primarily due to less favorable production variances.
selling, general and administrative expenses sg&a expenses increased 0.2% or $3.3 million to $2.18 billion in fiscal 2014 as compared to $2.17 billion in fiscal 2013, primarily driven by an increase in selling expenses. as a percentage of net sales, sg&a expenses increased to 45.3% during fiscal 2014 as compared to 42.8% during fiscal 2013. excluding items affecting comparability of $49.3 million in fiscal 2014 and $48.4 million in fiscal 2013, sg&a expenses increased $2.4 million from fiscal 2013; and sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales increased, primarily due to the increase in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales, to 44.3% in fiscal 2014 from 41.9% in fiscal 2013.
selling expenses were $1.55 billion, or 32.2% of net sales, in fiscal 2014 compared to $1.51 billion, or 29.8% of net sales, in fiscal 2013. the dollar increase in selling expenses reflected increases in new store openings in our international business including the impact of acquiring our former partner hackett's 50% interest in our european joint venture. these expenses were mostly offset by a favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates primarily related to coach japan and lower expenses in north america due to the divestiture of the reed krakoff business.
advertising, marketing, and design costs were $242.3 million, or 5.0% of net sales, in fiscal 2014, compared to $265.4 million, or 5.2% of net sales, during fiscal 2013. the decrease was primarily due to the divestiture of the reed krakoff business. this decrease was partially offset by increased advertising, marketing, and design costs related to the company's transformation efforts.
distribution and consumer service expenses of $87.2 million, or 1.8% of net sales, in fiscal 2014, were fairly consistent with fiscal 2013 expenses of $86.1 million, or 1.7% of net sales.
administrative expenses were $300.5 million, or 6.3% of net sales, in fiscal 2014 compared to $307.1 million, or 6.1% of net sales, during fiscal 2013. excluding items affecting comparability of $49.3 million in fiscal 2014 and $48.4 million in fiscal 2013, administrative expenses were $251.2 million, or 5.2% of net sales, in fiscal 2014 and $258.7 million, or 5.1% of net sales, in fiscal 2013. lower compensation expense was mostly offset by additional costs incurred as part of investments made in the business, particularly related to increased depreciation expense.
operating income operating income decreased 26.5% or $404.4 million to $1.12 billion during fiscal 2014 as compared to $1.52 billion in fiscal 2013. operating margin decreased to 23.3% as compared to 30.0% in fiscal 2013. excluding items affecting comparability of $131.5 million in fiscal 2014 and $53.2 million in fiscal 2013, operating income decreased 20.7% or $326.1 million to $1.25 billion from $1.58 billion in fiscal 2013; and operating margin was 26.0%, in fiscal 2014 as compared to 31.1% in fiscal 2013.

(1)   operating income in the other category consisted of sales and expenses generated in ancillary channels, including licensing and disposition.
north america operating income decreased 20.3% or $295.9 million to $1.16 billion in fiscal 2014 reflecting the decrease in gross profit of $353.1 million which was partially offset by lower sg&a expenses of $57.2 million. the decrease in sg&a expenses was related to the absence of costs in fiscal 2014 related to the divestiture of the reed krakoff business and lower variable selling costs as a result of lower sales. operating margin decreased 450 basis points to 37.5% in fiscal 2014 from 42.0% during
39
the same period in the prior year due to lower gross margin of 310 basis points and higher sg&a expense as a percentage of net sales of 140 basis points.
international operating income decreased 4.6% or $26.5 million to $555.7 million primarily reflecting higher sg&a expenses of $66.5 million partially offset by higher gross profit of $40.0 million. the increase in sg&a expenses is related to a $53.7 million increase in greater china and asia, excluding japan, related to higher occupancy and employee costs associated with new store openings and a $45.8 million increase as a result of the recently acquired europe business. the increase in sg&a costs was offset by foreign currency effects in japan of $42.6 million. operating margin decreased 360 basis points to 33.8% in fiscal 2014 from 37.4% during the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower gross margin of 180 basis points and higher overall selling expenses as a percentage of net sales which increased by 180 basis points.
corporate unallocated operating expense increased $86.2 million to $633.9 million, an increase of 15.7%. this increase was primarily attributable to higher charges incurred by the company in fiscal 2014 as part of its transformation plan. excluding items affecting comparability, unallocated operating expenses increased by 1.6% or $7.9 million to $502.4 million from $494.5 million.
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was 30.4% in fiscal 2014, as compared to 32.0% in fiscal 2013. excluding the items affecting comparability, the effective tax rate was 30.6% and 32.2% in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively. both fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 benefited from one-time discrete items. in fiscal 2014, the company recognized a net benefit related to refinements of its various tax accounts which were partially offset by the loss of deductions related to changes in key executives. during fiscal 2013, the company recognized a favorable tax settlement and the benefit of certain permanent adjustments related to executive compensation. these one-time discrete items favorably impacted our effective tax rate by approximately 220 basis points and 40 basis points in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively.
net income net income decreased 24.5% or $253.1 million to $781.3 million in fiscal 2014 as compared to $1.03 billion in fiscal 2013. excluding items of comparability, net income decreased 18.5% or $197.4 million to $869.6 million in fiscal 2014 from $1.07 billion in fiscal 2013. this decrease was primarily due to lower operating income partially offset by lower provision for income taxes.
earnings per share net income per diluted share decreased 22.7% to $2.79 in fiscal 2014 as compared to $3.61 in fiscal 2013. excluding items of comparability, net income per diluted share decreased 16.9% or $0.63 to $3.10 in fiscal 2014 from $3.73 in fiscal 2013, due to lower net income.
40
items affecting comparability of our financial results non-gaap measures the company's reported results are presented in accordance with gaap. the reported gross profit, sg&a expenses, operating income, provision for income taxes, net income and earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 reflect certain items which affect the comparability of our results, including the impact of the transformation plan and acquisition-related charges. these metrics are also reported on a non-gaap basis to exclude the impact of these items.
these non-gaap performance measures were used by management to conduct and evaluate its business during its regular review of operating results for the periods affected. management and the company's board utilized these non-gaap measures to make decisions about the uses of company resources, analyze performance between periods, develop internal projections and measure management performance. the company's primary internal financial reporting excluded these items affecting comparability. in addition, the compensation committee of the company's board will use these non-gaap measures when setting and assessing achievement of incentive compensation goals.
additionally, certain increases and decreases in operating results for the company and its north america and international segment have been presented both including and excluding currency fluctuation effects from translating foreign-denominated amounts into u.s. dollars and compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.
we believe these non-gaap measures are useful to investors in evaluating the company's ongoing operating and financial results and understanding how such results compare with the company's historical performance. additionally, we believe presenting certain increases and decreases that include and exclude the effect of foreign currency fluctuations helps investors and analysts understand the effect of significant year-over-year currency fluctuations. we believe excluding the items affecting comparability assists investors in developing expectations of future performance. by providing the non-gaap measures, as a supplement to gaap information, we believe we are enhancing investors' understanding of our business and our results of operations. the non-gaap financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, u.s. gaap financial measures. further, these non-gaap measures may be unique to the company, as they may be different from non-gaap measures used by other companies.
for a detailed discussion on these non-gaap measures, see item 6. "selected financial data," and the results of operations section within item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."

the company's cash and cash equivalents increased $699.9 million in fiscal 2015 compared to a decrease of $470.9 million in fiscal 2014, primarily due to net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2015.
net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased $48.0 million primarily due to lower net income of $378.9 million from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015, partially offset by changes in our operating asset and liability balances of $331.4 million.
changes in our operating asset and liability balances were primarily driven by changes in accounts payable, inventory, other balance sheet changes and accrued liabilities. accounts payable were a source of cash of $64.4 million in fiscal 2015, driven primarily by the timing of inventory purchases and lease termination payments, as compared to a use of cash of $30.2 million in fiscal 2014. inventory was a source of cash of $29.2 million in fiscal 2015, primarily driven by overall lower inventory purchases in fiscal 2015, as compared to a use of cash of $64.1 million in fiscal 2014. other balance sheet changes, net, which primarily relate to other assets, were a source of cash of $17.8 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to a use of cash of $64.2 million in fiscal 2014, primarily due to a decrease in tax receivables and changes in deferred tax accounts. accrued liabilities were a source of cash
41
of $63.2 million in fiscal 2015, primarily driven by increased payroll and incentive compensation accruals, as compared to source of cash of $14.1 million in fiscal 2014.
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $612.9 million in fiscal 2015 compared to $707.7 million in fiscal 2014. the decrease in net cash used of $94.8 million was primarily due to the impact of net proceeds from our investment portfolio of $255.6 million in fiscal 2015, compared to net cash used for purchase of investments of $397.1 million in fiscal 2014, offset by an increase in net cash used of $515.8 million in cash used for acquisitions, related to the stuart weitzman acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, as well as an increase in net cash used of $51.9 million related to increased investments in the hudson yards joint venture.
net cash provided by (used in) financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was $389.3 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to a use of cash of $748.1 million in fiscal 2014. this increase of cash provided of $1,137.4 million was primarily due to the debt borrowings described in note 11, "debt", as well as the absence of cash used for share repurchases during fiscal 2015. the company received $896.7 million in proceeds from long term debt, net of discount, which was partially offset by net repayments of $140 million under the company's amended and restated credit agreement during fiscal 2015, compared to $140 million of net borrowings during fiscal 2014. furthermore, the company used $524.9 million for share repurchases in fiscal 2014, compared to no stock repurchases occurring in fiscal 2015.

(1)   as of june 27, 2015, approximately 57% of our cash and short-term investments were held outside the u.s. in jurisdictions where we intend to permanently reinvest our undistributed earnings to support our continued growth. we are not dependent on foreign cash to fund our domestic operations. if we choose to repatriate any funds to the u.s. in the future, we would be subject to applicable u.s. and foreign taxes.
(2)   excludes $320.2 million of our non-current investment related to the hudson yards joint venture. refer to note 6, "investments," for further information.
(3)   in march 2015, the company amended and restated its existing $700.0 million revolving credit facility (the "revolving facility") with certain lenders and jp morgan chase bank, n.a. as the administrative agent, to provide for a five-year senior unsecured $300.0 million term loan (the "term loan") and to extend the maturity date to march 18, 2020 (the "amended and restated credit agreement"). the amended and restated credit agreement contains various covenants and customary events of default, including the requirement to maintain a maximum ratio of adjusted debt to consolidated ebitdar, as defined in the agreement, of no greater than 4.0 as of the date of measurement. as of june 27, 2015, no known events of default have occurred. furthermore, in march 2015, the company issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.250% senior unsecured notes due april 1, 2025 at 99.445% of par (the "4.250% senior notes"). our average borrowings outstanding under our revolving facility for the fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 were $120.4 million and $93.9 million, respectively. refer to note 11, "debt," for further information on our existing debt instruments.
we believe that our amended and restated credit agreement is adequately diversified with no undue concentrations in any one financial institution. as of june 27, 2015, there were 11 financial institutions participating in the facility, with no one participant maintaining a maximum commitment percentage in excess of 14%. we have no reason at this time to believe that
42
the participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the facility in the event we elect to draw funds in the foreseeable future.
we have the ability to draw on our credit facilities or access other sources of financing options available to us in the credit and capital markets for, among other things, funding our investment in the hudson yards joint venture, our transformation-related initiatives, acquisition or integration-related costs, settlement of a material contingency, or a material adverse business or macroeconomic development, as well as for other general corporate business purposes.
management believes that cash flows from operations, access to the credit and capital markets and our credit lines, on-hand cash and cash equivalents and our investments will provide adequate funds to support our operating, capital, and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, our plans for acquisitions, further business expansion and transformation-related initiatives. future events, such as acquisitions or joint ventures, and other similar transactions may require additional capital. there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. our ability to fund working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, dividend payments and scheduled debt payments, as well as to comply with all of the financial covenants under our debt agreements, depends on future operating performance and cash flow, which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond the company's control.
hudson yards joint venture in april 2013 the company entered into a joint venture agreement with the related companies, l.p. to develop a new office tower in manhattan in the hudson yards district. the formation of the joint venture serves as a financing vehicle for the project, with the company owning less than 43% of the joint venture. upon completion of the office tower, the company will retain a condominium interest serving as its new corporate headquarters. during fiscal 2015 the company invested $139.1 million in the joint venture. since the formation of the hudson yards joint venture, the company has invested $320.2 million in the joint venture. the company expects to further invest approximately $210 million, the significant majority of which will be by the end of fiscal 2016, depending on construction progress. in addition to its investment in the joint venture, coach is directly investing in a portion of the design and build-out of the new corporate headquarters and has incurred $34.0 million of capital expenditures to date, including $5.9 million in fiscal 2015, and expects to incur approximately $185 million over the remaining period of construction.
stuart weitzman acquisition on january 5, 2015, the company entered into a purchase agreement with stuart weitzman topco llc and stuart weitzman intermediate llc, a wholly owned subsidiary of topco. on may 4, 2015, the acquisition was consummated. under the terms of the stuart weitzman purchase agreement, coach purchased all of the equity interests of stuart weitzman intermediate llc, a luxury footwear company and the parent of stuart weitzman holdings, llc, from topco for an aggregate payment of approximately $531.1 million in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments, as well as a potential earnout of up to $14.7 million annually in cash over the next three calendar years based on the achievement of certain revenue targets. on may 4, 2015, the company funded the acquisition through cash on-hand, including the utilization of a portion of debt related proceeds, as described in note 11, "debt." refer to note 7, "acquisitions," for further discussion on the stuart weitzman acquisition.
seasonality because coach products are frequently given as gifts, we experience seasonal variations in net sales, operating cash flows and working capital requirements, primarily related to seasonal holiday shopping. during the first fiscal quarter, we build inventory for the holiday selling season.  in the second fiscal quarter, our working capital requirements are reduced substantially as we generate higher net sales and operating income, especially during the holiday months of november and december. fluctuations in net sales, operating income and operating cash flows in any fiscal quarter may be affected by other events affecting retail sales, such as changes in weather patterns or other macroeconomic events.
common stock repurchase program in october 2012, the company's board of directors approved a common stock repurchase program to acquire up to $1.5 billion of coach's outstanding common stock through june 2015. as of june 27, 2015, the program has expired.
purchases of coach common stock are made subject to market conditions and at prevailing market prices, through open market purchases. under maryland law, coach's state of incorporation, treasury shares are not allowed. as a result, all repurchased shares are retired when acquired.
during fiscal 2015, the company did not repurchase or retire any shares. during fiscal 2014, the company repurchased and retired 10.2 million shares, or $524.9 million of common stock, at an average cost of $51.27.

(1)   related to firm capital expenditure purchase obligations. the company expects total capital expenditures to be in the area of $300 million in fiscal 2016, excluding the capital cost associated with the new headquarters.
(2)   payments are estimated and may vary based on construction progress.
(3)   interest obligations exclude interest on the revolving facility and term loan as the interest rate on these arrangements is variable. see note 11, "debt," for more information.
excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the non-current liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $185.7 million as of june 27, 2015, as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled, if ever. the above table also excludes amounts included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at june 27, 2015 as these items will be paid within one year, certain long-term liabilities not requiring cash payments and cash contributions for the company's pension plans.
off-balance sheet arrangements in addition to the commitments included in the table above, we have outstanding letters of credit $6.8 million as of june 27, 2015, primarily serving to collateralize our obligation to third parties for insurance claims and store leases. these letters of credit expire at various dates through 2016.
as discussed earlier, the company entered into a joint venture agreement with the related companies, l.p. to develop a new office tower in manhattan in the hudson yards district, in april 2013. the formation of the hudson yards joint venture serves as a financing vehicle for the project. construction of the new building has commenced and upon expected completion of the office tower in fiscal 2016, the company will retain a condominium interest serving as its new corporate headquarters. the company's maximum loss exposure is limited to the committed capital.
we do not maintain any other off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements. refer to note 12, "commitments and contingencies," to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the company's financial statements. actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of judgment. actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. the development and selection of the company's critical accounting policies and estimates are periodically reviewed with the audit committee of the board.
the accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements. for more information on the company's accounting policies, please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements.

revenue recognition revenue is recognized by the company when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred (and risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer), price has been fixed or is determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.
retail store and concession-based shop-in-shop revenues are recognized at the point of sale, which occurs when merchandise is sold in an over-the-counter consumer transaction. these revenues are recognized net of estimated returns at the time of sale to consumers. internet revenue from sales of products ordered through the company's e-commerce sites is recognized upon delivery and receipt of the shipment by its customers and includes shipping and handling charges paid by customers. internet revenue is also reduced by an estimate for returns.
wholesale revenue is recognized at the time title passes and risk of loss is transferred to customers. wholesale revenue is recorded net of estimates of returns, discounts and markdown allowances. returns and allowances require pre-approval from management and discounts are based on trade terms. estimates for markdown reserves are based on historical trends, actual and forecasted seasonal results, an evaluation of current economic and market conditions, retailer performance, and, in certain cases, contractual terms. the company reviews and refines these estimates on at least a quarterly basis. the company's historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results.
at june 27, 2015, a 10% change in the allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts, markdowns and returns would have resulted in an insignificant change in the company's reserves and net sales.
gift cards issued by the company are recorded as a liability until they are redeemed, at which point revenue is recognized. the company recognizes income for unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of a gift card being redeemed by a customer is remote, which is approximately two years after the gift card is issued, and the company determines that it does not have a legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift card to the relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or abandoned property. revenue associated with gift card breakage is not material to the company's net operating results.
inventories the company's inventories are reported at the lower of cost or market. inventory costs include material, conversion costs, freight and duties and are primarily determined by the first-in, first-out method. the company reserves for inventory, including slow-moving and aged inventory, based on current product demand, expected future demand and historical experience. a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes, buying patterns or increased competition could impact the company's evaluation of its inventory and additional reserves might be required. estimates may differ from actual results due to the quantity, quality and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences and market conditions. at june 27, 2015, a 10% change in the inventory reserve, excluding amounts associated with the transformation plan, would have resulted in an insignificant change in inventory and cost of sales. refer to note 3, "transformation and other actions," for charges related to inventory under the company's transformation plan.
business combinations in connection with an acquisition, we are required to record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair value, including the recognition of contingent consideration at fair value on the acquisition date. these fair value determinations require our judgment and may involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives, and market multiples, among other items. we may utilize independent third-party valuation firms to assist in making these fair value determinations. refer to note 7, "acquisitions," for detailed disclosures related to our acquisitions.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives, including trademarks and trade names, are not amortized, but are assessed for impairment at least annually. finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and, and along with other long-lived assets as noted above, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable. estimates of fair value for finite-lived intangible assets are primarily determined using discounted cash flows, with consideration of market comparisons and recent transactions. this approach may use significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates.
45
the company generally performs its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment analysis using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of such assets are less than their respective carrying values. if, based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it is concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the asset exceeds its carrying value, a quantitative test is performed. the quantitative goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. the first step is to identify the existence of potential impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the reporting unit's goodwill is considered not to be impaired and performance of the second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test is unnecessary.
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. if the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination. in other words, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit.
determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit is based on management's assessment, considering independent third-party appraisals when necessary. furthermore, this determination is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the amount of any such charge. estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows, market comparisons, and recent transactions. these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows, discount rates, growth rates, and determination of appropriate market comparables.
the company performs its annual impairment assessment of goodwill, including trademarks and trade names, during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. the company determined that there was no impairment in fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 or fiscal 2013 as the fair values of our reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values.
valuation of long-lived assets long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. in evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, the company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. to the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value, considering external market participant assumptions.
in determining future cash flows, coach takes various factors into account, including changes in merchandising strategy, the emphasis on retail store cost controls, the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending, the impacts of the experienced level of retail store managers, the level of advertising, promotional cadence and in-store capital investments. since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, there may be future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations.
share-based compensation the company recognizes the cost of equity awards to employees and the non-employee directors based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. the grant-date fair values of share unit awards are based on the fair value of the company's common stock on the date of grant. the grant-date fair value of stock option awards is determined using the black-scholes option pricing model and involves several assumptions, including the expected term of the option, expected volatility and dividend yield. the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience. expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company's stock as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded options on the company's stock. dividend yield is based on the current expected annual dividend per share and the company's stock price. changes in the assumptions used to determine the black-scholes value could result in significant changes in the black-scholes value.
for stock options and share unit awards, the company recognizes share-based compensation net of estimated forfeitures and revises the estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimates. we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as expected future behavior.
the company grants performance-based share awards to certain key executives, the vesting of which is subject to the executive's continuing employment and the company's achievement of certain performance goals. on a quarterly basis, the company assesses actual performance versus the predetermined performance goals, and adjusts the share-based compensation
46
expense to reflect the relative performance achievement. actual distributed shares are calculated upon conclusion of the service and performance periods, and include dividend equivalent shares. if the performance-based award incorporates a market condition, the grant-date fair value of such award is determined using a pricing model, such as a monte carlo simulation.
a hypothetical 10% change in our stock-based compensation expense would have affected our fiscal 2015 net income by approximately $7 million.
income taxes the company's effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations, and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which coach operates. the company classifies interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes. we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized. in making such determination, we consider all available evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operation. we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some amount of deferred tax assets is not expected to be realized.
the company recognizes the impact of tax positions in the financial statements if those positions will more likely than not be sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. although we believe that the estimates and assumptions we use are reasonable and legally supportable, the final determination of tax audits could be different than that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities. tax authorities periodically audit the company's income tax returns, and in specific cases, the tax authorities may take a contrary position that could result in a significant impact on our results of operations. significant management judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate, in evaluating our tax positions and in determining the net realizable value of deferred tax assets.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 2, "significant accounting policies," to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a description of certain recently issued or proposed accounting standards which may impact our consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.

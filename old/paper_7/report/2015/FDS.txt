executive overview factset is a provider of integrated financial information and analytical applications to the global investment community. we combine content regarding companies and securities from major markets all over the globe into a single online platform of information and analytics. by consolidating content from hundreds of databases with powerful analytics, factset supports the investment process from initial research to published results for buy and sell-side professionals. these professionals include portfolio managers, research and performance analysts, risk managers, marketing professionals, sell-side equity research professionals, investment bankers and fixed income professionals. our applications provide users access to company and industry analyses, multicompany comparisons, company screening, portfolio analysis, predictive risk measurements, alphatesting, portfolio optimization and simulation, real-time news and quotes and tools to value and analyze fixed income securities and portfolios. with microsoft® office integration, wireless access and customizable options, we offer a complete financial workflow solution. our revenues are derived from month-to-month subscriptions to services, databases and financial applications. investment management (buy-side) clients account for 82.5% of our annual subscription value ("asv"), with the remainder from investment banking firms (sell-side) that perform mergers & acquisitions ("m&a") advisory work, capital markets services and equity research.
2015 year in review fiscal 2015 was a successful year for factset as we once again attained record levels of revenue, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share. this fiscal year marked our 37th year of operation, our 35th consecutive year of revenue growth and our 19th consecutive year of earnings growth as a public company. our record results demonstrate the continued success of the factset brand. we grew organic asv by $88.4 million compared to $64.6 million a year ago, which resulted in an organic asv growth rate of 9.2%, up from 7.3% last year. our asv growth rate of 9.2% helped us surpass the $1 billion milestone in total asv and end the year at $1.058 billion. the acceleration in asv to 9.2% was also our highest rate of growth in over three years, while our 13.0% diluted earnings per share increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 represented our 21st consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted eps growth. in addition, clients and users reached record highs of 2,976 and 62,205, respectively, in fiscal 2015, including a quarterly record of 3,210 users during the fourth quarter.

growth in each key metric growth during fiscal 2015 was driven by delivering comprehensive workflow solutions to our clients, improvements in the functionality of our product line including portfolio analytics, enhancements to our technological infrastructure, expansion of our proprietary data and a continued focus on client service. as a result, each of the following key operating metrics experienced growth over the past 12 months ($ in millions, except client and user counts):

(1)   asv grew 9.2% organically year over year.

(2)   we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, which includes the cash cost for taxes and changes in working capital, less capital expenditures.

additionally, our annual client retention was greater than 95% of asv as of august 31, 2015, consistent with last year. however, when expressed as a percentage of clients, our annual retention rate was 94%, up from 93% a year ago.
returning value to stockholders on may 12, 2015, our board of directors approved a 12.8% increase in the regular quarterly dividend, beginning with the dividend payment in june 2015 of $0.44 per share, or $1.76 per share per annum. in addition, we repurchased 1.7 million shares for $252.8 million under the existing share repurchase program during fiscal 2015. with our dividends and share repurchases we have returned $322.8 million in the aggregate to stockholders over the past 12 months.
capital expenditures capital expenditures were $25.7 million during fiscal 2015, up from $17.7 million a year ago. approximately $13.8 million, or 54%, of our capital expenditures during fiscal 2015 were for purchases of computer equipment. this expense included more servers for our existing data centers, purchasing laptop computers and peripherals for employees, upgrading existing computer systems and improving telecommunication equipment. the remaining 46% of our capital expenditures were used to build out our offices primarily in new york, new york, austin, texas and manila, the philippines during fiscal 2015.
product developments to enhance our workflow solutions at factset, we are dedicated to building tools to support the workflows of our traditional asset management and investment banking base, as well as to extend our core competency to encompass wealth managers, sales & trading, private equity and hedge funds. in fiscal 2015, we introduced unique product innovations and applications across our segments which have improved the speed, usability and discoverability of our workstation. in addition to making the application more intuitive, we also released new site-wide search functionality which allows users to discover reports and applications. in support of data integrity, we released factset portfolio services to offer robust and transparent data reconciliations and standardized custom reporting options across regions and asset classes. factset geographical revenue exposure (georev), a recently released data set, enhances the way a user can view company revenues by geographic country and regional categories.
content and technology our product capabilities and goals are not possible without investments in content. we are focused on metrics that measure the impact of our content used by our clients; timeliness, accuracy, completeness, coverage and usage. highlights of fiscal 2015 enhancements to our proprietary content are as follows:
factset enterprise data governance as a major publisher of financial content, factset continues to optimize its data governance model by employing enterprise level standards for entity and security reference data. leveraging these enterprise standards enables us to connect effectively all of its proprietary and third party content through a consistent reference data framework. this integration allows our client base to leverage factset content across multiple workflows via the creation of highly connected "smart data" sets. users are able to extend analytics and alpha generation by identifying intelligent correlations amongst connected data points, uncover complex relationships amongst entities, securities, people and funds (hierarchies, supply chains, board relationships) and leverage data connectivity to drive risk and regulatory reporting (aggregation, conflict of interest, counterparty discovery).
23
factset revere during fiscal 2015, factset continued to invest in the revere content product lines with enhancements including factset revere hierarchy, a unique industry classification system that categorizes companies based on both their primary and secondary lines of business; factset revere segment revenue ("segrev"), which links a company's as-reported business segment revenue and product categories to the factset revere hierarchy; factset supply chain relationships, content that enables users to understand the performance and risk of a company by accessing its key customers, suppliers, competitors and partners; and factset revere business industry classification system ("factset rbics"), which leverages the granularity of the factset revere hierarchy to classify companies by their primarily line of business. the database has 12 anchor sectors and is six levels deep with increasingly detailed layers of micro-industry groups.
factset fundamentals in fiscal 2015, we added banks to the industry metrics offering and metrics to the oil & gas and metals & mining offerings, bringing the key performance indicator coverage to seven industries, 5,600 active companies and 750 metrics. we also added over 2,600 companies to coverage for the standardized product, bringing the active universe to over 47,000 and the overall universe to 79,000.
factset callstreet (events and transcripts)
this offering continues to provide high quality transcripts while maintaining industry standard timeliness metrics for raw and corrected earnings call transcripts for over 80% of the callstreet universe. coverage of transcripts and events grew 9% and 5%, respectively, during fiscal 2015.
factset ownership in fiscal 2015 this data set expanded to include fixed income funds. fund holders of fixed income securities can be used in conjunction with other factset ownership standard data feeds. with history starting from september 2013, the fixed income securities and funds included are global in scope, and both active and terminated securities and funds are included.
factset infrastructure the foundation to our product, content and technology goals is the focus on our infrastructure. we have invested a significant amount of resources in the evolution of our computing resources, storage capabilities, security posture and ability to scale. part of this investment includes project nextgen, which has helped us transition from large mainframe computers to a more distributed environment powered by a vast array of smaller, faster and more cost-effective machines. this new architecture will allow us to be more agile and respond to the market quickly going forward, as well as enabling us to build new products and features.
continued focus on client service client service is a vital component of our business model. we support our powerful information and analytical applications with a team of financial data and modeling experts. client service is performed each and every day via email, text, instant messaging, or phone. client touches are a key metric by which we measure the success of our service. according to our fiscal 2015 global client satisfaction survey, 97% of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with factset's support, consistent with the prior year. the depth of our knowledge, the data behind the models and the complex mathematics behind the answers each create an opportunity for us to forge close working relationships with our user community.
our reward for investing in a consulting group comprised of approximately 1,400 individuals is client loyalty, as evidenced by an annual client retention rate of greater than 95% of asv as of august 31, 2015. our consulting teams have been trained to listen to our clients' needs and transfer this knowledge directly to the product development teams, helping us transform suggestions into new or enhanced product offerings. educating our clients is also an important component of our service. not only do we teach our users the nuances of our software and content offerings, but factset personnel are often thought-leaders in a particular area of financial modeling in our rapidly evolving industry. as a result, clients look to factset as a trusted partner to stay on the cutting edge of financial modeling and analysis. during fiscal 2015, nearly 1,900 clients attended live or online factset training sessions; more than 6,000 investment bankers were trained on how to use our systems; clients completed 29,000 elearning courses in our online library; and clients referenced our online help and reference library over 700,000 times.
employees our industry-leading customer care is largely due to the talent of our employee population. as of august 31, 2015, employee headcount was 7,360, up 10.9% from a year ago. of our total employees, 2,238 were located in the u.s., 832 in europe and 4,290 in asia pacific. approximately 54% of our employees were involved with content collection, 24% work in product development, software and systems engineering, another 19% conduct sales and consulting services and the remaining 3% provided administrative support. we are proud to have received the following accolades during fiscal 2015:
●   ranked #48 on fortune's "100 best companies to work for."

24
●   named as one of the "100 best workplaces for millennials" in the u.s. by fortune.

revenues fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014
revenues in fiscal 2015 were $1,006.8 million, up 9.4% compared to fiscal 2014. our revenue growth drivers during fiscal 2015 were increases in asv, clients and users, accelerated demand for our fixed income portfolio products, portfolio analytics ("pa") suite of products, sales of equity attribution and multi asset class risk models, additional purchases of our portfolio services solutions, expansion of our proprietary content, and continued growth of our rms offering.
annual subscription value as of august 31, 2015, asv was $1.058 billion, up 9.2% organically from a year ago. asv at a given point in time represents the forward-looking revenues for the next 12 months from all subscription services being supplied to our clients. with proper notice to us, our clients are able to add to, delete portions of, or terminate service at any time, subject to certain contractual limitations.

we believe that our organic asv growth of 9.2% in fiscal 2015 and 7.3% in fiscal 2014 highlight the strength of our subscription business model. we continue to focus on expanding the business by providing superior analytical applications, premier global content and unmatched client service. the 9.2% increase in organic asv during fiscal 2015 relates to broad-based global growth from both the buy and sell-side. we have seen accelerated demand for our fixed income portfolio products, pa suite of products, sales of equity attribution and multi asset class risk models. our stable of value-added products in the equity and fixed income analytics suite provided the company with strong sales in our european and asia pacific segments. organic asv growth of 9.2% excludes $10 million of asv from acquisitions completed during fiscal 2015 and a $3.9 million detriment from foreign currency.
25
asv from our u.s. operations was $714.8 million, up 8.7% organically from a year ago. international asv totaled $343.1 million as of august 31, 2015, up 10.2% organically from a year ago and represented 32.4% of our company-wide total. organic asv growth rates from buy and sell-side clients rose to 9.0% and 9.8%, respectively. the percentage of our total asv derived from buy-side clients decreased slightly from 82.6% a year ago to 82.5% at august 31, 2015.
growth in the number of users and clients of factset during fiscal 2015, we added 183 net new clients (which excludes 50 new clients acquired from the acquisition of code red in february 2015), increasing the number of clients by 6.7% over the prior year. including the 50 new clients from code red, our total client count was 2,976 as of august 31, 2015. the addition of new clients is important to us as we anticipate that it lays the groundwork to provide additional services in the future, consistent with our strategy of increasing sales of workstations, applications and content at our existing clients. annual client retention as of august 31, 2015 was greater than 95% of asv and 94% when expressed as a percentage of clients, an increase from 93% as of the end of fiscal 2014. we believe these statistics underscore the power of our business model, as the large majority of our clients maintain their subscriptions to factset throughout each year. at august 31, 2015, our largest individual client accounted for 2% of total subscriptions and annual subscriptions from our ten largest clients did not surpass 15% of total client subscriptions, consistent with the prior year.
at august 31, 2015, there were 62,205 professionals using factset, an increase of 7,609 users from a year ago. during the last twelve months, our investment management clients added 4,203 net new users, while our investment banking clients added 3,406 net new users. our user count within the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 alone increased by 3,210 users compared to 2,113 in the year ago fourth quarter, marking it our largest ever quarterly increase. significant additions came from both our investment management and banking clients. the fourth quarter typically includes new users from both the buy and sell-side, as our larger clients bring in new hire classes and this quarter we saw sizable new hire classes at our banking clients. growth during 2015 in both the ipo and m&a markets has also helped improve business for our banking clients. in addition, during the just completed fiscal year, we released a new user interface that emphasizes ease of use and search, which we believe contributed to our net user increase in fiscal 2015.
growth within portfolio analytics our pa suite of products, including our fixed income in pa product, continues to be well received within our client base and was a source of revenue growth during fiscal 2015. our clients have recognized the value of these applications and their capabilities in analyzing securities and portfolios. the pa suite includes separate products and covers a range of workflows around portfolios. the number of clients and users subscribing to pa, fixed income in pa, style, performance and risk ("spar"), risk and portfolio publishing continued to grow as this suite is comprehensive and includes highly desired applications for portfolio attribution, risk, quantitative analysis, portfolio publishing and returns based, style analysis. clients continue to find value in our ability to serve as a single solution for their analytics, risk and publishing needs, over a variety of asset classes, which enables them to analyze securities and portfolios based on a variety of asset classes.
increased demand for portfolio services solutions our solutions in the portfolio services space continued to do well. our services offer turnkey integration, robust and transparent reconciliation and standardized and custom reporting options. our team of specialists monitors and remedies issues as they occur during all stages of the client's workflow, from data extraction to analytical enrichment, through report generation and data delivery. as clients look for areas to outsource services around data integration, enrichment, quality control and process monitoring, they are turning more and more to our managed services in this space.
expansion of our proprietary content our proprietary content also continues to be a strong product line for us as well as a growing opportunity for us to expand our data feed business. we continue to be successful in licensing proprietary factset data, especially factset fundamentals and factset estimates, as our global content sales team pursues expanding the distribution of our content. this type of data is licensed in feed form and includes as-reported financials, etf data & analytics, enterprise data governance, callstreet and ownership. data feeds are consumed by a wide range of clients, including existing large factset clients and some outside of our core client base that do not manage money or provide sell-side services. in addition, streetaccount, our condensed news product, sells strongly across all factset user types and continues to be in demand due to the ability of our clients to receive up-to-the-minute news offered both through and outside the factset workstation.

research management solutions (rms)
on february 6, 2015, we acquired code red whose primary line of business is to provide research management technologies to the investment community, including endowments and foundations, institutional asset managers, sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and hedge funds. with the addition of code red to factset's existing research management solution, we now offer an rms for all our clients' workflows. at the time of acquisition, code red had annual subscriptions of $9.3 million. for fiscal 2015, the acquisition of code red added incremental revenue of $5.2 million. together with our internal research notes product, our rms solutions continued to grow, particularly in the fourth quarter, as clients now have a choice between our hosted and local solutions.
effects of foreign currency the positive revenue drivers disclosed above were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency, including a weaker japanese yen, british pound sterling and euro. foreign currency movements reduced revenues by $3.4 million during fiscal 2015 compared to a reduction of $1.2 million in fiscal 2014.
fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
revenues in fiscal 2014 were $920.3 million, up 7.3% compared to fiscal 2013. revenue growth drivers during fiscal 2014 were the addition of 200 new clients and 3,628 users, a 7.3% increase in organic asv, continued growth in our portfolio analytics suite of products, rising sales of our wealth management workflow solution, expansion of proprietary content, stabilization within sell-side client base and incremental revenues from the acquisitions of revere and matrix. organic asv growth of 7.3% excludes $12 million of asv acquired from revere and matrix during fiscal 2014 and a $0.8 million detriment from foreign currency.

revenues from our u.s. segment increased 8.7% to $678.8 million in fiscal 2015 compared to $624.6 million a year ago. our fiscal 2015 u.s. revenue growth rate of 8.7% reflects increases in the number of users and clients of factset within the u.s., a rise in sales of our pa suite of products, continued demand for our proprietary content, $5.2 million of incremental revenue from the acquisition of code red and a strong performance by our u.s. investment management sales team. our u.s. buy-side sales team has seen sustained demand for our fixed income portfolio products, multi-asset class risk and stress testing, attribution and publishing products. revenues from our u.s. operations accounted for 67.4% of our consolidated revenues during fiscal 2015, down from 67.9% a year ago, as our international asv growth rate surpassed our u.s. asv growth rate by 150 basis points.
international revenues increased 10.9% to $328.0 million during fiscal 2015. excluding negative foreign currency effects of $3.4 million, the year over year international revenue growth rate was 12.1%, which was comprised of 11.0% for europe and 15.5% for asia pacific. revenues from international operations accounted for 32.6% of our consolidated revenues during fiscal 2015, up from 32.1% a year ago.
european revenues advanced 10.6% year over year which was attributable to increases in client and user counts, continued growth in asv from european sell-side clients and robust sales of pa subscriptions, partially offset by the negative effects of foreign currency. foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced our european growth rate by 40 basis points. the asia pacific revenue growth rate of 12.0% was primarily due to net new user and client growth, increased pa subscriptions and our proficiency in selling additional services to existing clients, partially offset by negative foreign currency impact attributable to the change in the value of the japanese yen compared to the u.s. dollar. foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced our asia pacific growth rate by 350 basis points.

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
revenues from our u.s. segment increased 6.4% to $624.6 million in fiscal 2014 compared to $586.9 million in fiscal 2013. revenue growth was driven by the addition of users and clients, sales of our pa suite of products, growth in our wealth management solutions, increased demand for our proprietary content, and increment revenue from the revere acquisition, which increased our u.s. growth rate by 80 basis points. revenue growth was partially offset by a contraction in the market metrics business during fiscal 2014, which lowered our u.s. growth rate by 60 basis points. international revenues increased 9.0% to $295.7 million during fiscal 2014. excluding foreign currency effects and the matrix acquisition, the year over year international revenue growth rate was 6.7%, comprised of 5.0% for europe and 12.2% for asia pacific. revenues from international operations accounted for 32.1% of our consolidated revenues during fiscal 2014, up from 31.6% a year ago primarily as a result of incremental revenues from the matrix acquisition.

(2)   total operating expenses in fiscal 2013 include an incremental $18.3 million from the vesting of performance-based stock options granted in connection with the acquisition of market metrics and streetaccount. of this total charge, $16.4 million was reported within sg&amp;a expenses.

cost of services fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014
cost of services increased 14.6% to $405.3 million as compared to the same period a year ago. expressed as a percentage of revenues, cost of services was 40.3% in fiscal 2015, an increase of 190 basis points from a year ago. the increase was driven by higher employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, partially offset by lower computer depreciation.
employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, when expressed as a percentage of revenues, increased 210 basis points during fiscal 2015 due to new classes of consultants, engineers and product developers hired in the past 12 months, new additions at our proprietary content collection locations, the addition of 32 employees from the code red acquisition, an increase in variable compensation and annual base salary increases. over the last 12 months, we have added 344 net new employees involved with content collection, 252 net new engineering and product development employees and 124 net new consultants, as we continue to focus on servicing our existing client base, expanding our content and improving our applications. in addition, of the total incremental $6.2 million expense recorded in fiscal 2015 from the vesting of performance-based equity instruments and changes in the senior leadership responsible for the company's salesforce, $2.4 million was reported within cost of services. expenses associated with the operation of the code red business increased cost of services by $3.5 million during fiscal 2015 due to compensation paid to the acquired workforce, including stock-based compensation from equity based awards granted, amortization of acquired intangible assets and computer-related expenses.
partially offsetting the growth in cost of services during fiscal 2015 was a reduction in computer depreciation expense, which decreased 20 basis points in fiscal 2015 compared to a year ago. this decrease was primarily due to the continued use of fully depreciated equipment and our transition to more efficient and cost-effective servers in our data centers.
fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
cost of services increased 15.4% to $353.7 million in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. expressed as a percentage of revenues, cost of services was 38.4% in fiscal 2014, an increase of 270 basis points from fiscal 2013. the increase was driven by higher employee compensation, additional third party data costs and incremental costs from the revere and matrix acquisitions, partially offset by lower computer-related expenses, including depreciation.
employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, expressed as a percentage of revenues, increased 300 basis points during fiscal 2014. excluding compensation attributable to the acquired revere and matrix workforces, the increase in employee compensation was 250 basis points largely due to increased employee headcount and annual employee base salary increases. in fiscal 2014, we hired 202 net new software engineers and 70 net new consultants, dedicated to the development, enhancement and support of our products. third party data costs when expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 10 basis points during fiscal 2014. many of our data contracts are driven by our user and client count, so as we continue to grow in these metrics, so do our data-related costs. user count rose by 7% while clients grew 10% in fiscal 2014, thus driving up our third party data costs. expenses associated with the operations of revere and matrix increased the cost of services, when expressed as a percentage of revenues, by 80 basis points during fiscal 2014 due to compensation paid to the acquired workforce, stock-based compensation from equity-based awards granted, incremental third party data costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets.
28
partially offsetting the growth in cost of services during fiscal 2014 was a reduction in computer-related expenses. computer-related expenses, including computer depreciation and maintenance costs, decreased 30 basis points in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to the continued use of fully depreciated equipment and our transition to more efficient and cost-effective servers in our data centers.
selling, general and administrative (sg&a)
fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014
sg&a expenses increased 1.9% to $269.5 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to $264.4 million in fiscal 2014. expressed as a percentage of revenues, sg&a expenses decreased 190 basis points to 26.8% in fiscal 2015 due to lower employee compensation and lower occupancy costs, which include rent and depreciation of furniture and fixtures.
employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, when expressed as a percentage of revenues, decreased 130 basis points due to a higher percentage of our employee base working in a cost of services capacity versus sg&a. of our total employee headcount increase in fiscal 2015, 84% was within our software engineering, content collection and product development teams, which are all included within cost of services. as such, sg&a employee compensation declined compared to the growth in cost of services. occupancy costs, when expressed as a percentage of revenues, decreased 60 basis points, primarily due to furniture and leasehold improvements becoming fully depreciated, lower rent expense from the strengthening of the u.s. dollar and the timing of acquiring new real estate space. however, certain occupancy costs, such as rent, are temporary and are being driven by the timing of acquiring new space to support our growing employee population.
fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
sg&a expenses decreased 6.3% to $264.4 million during fiscal 2014 as compared to $282.3 million in 2013. expressed as a percentage of revenues, sg&a expenses decreased 420 basis points to 28.7% for fiscal 2014 due to lower employee compensation, including stock-based compensation partially offset by higher employee travel and entertainment ("t&e") expenses.
employee compensation when expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased 440 basis points from fiscal 2013 due to a higher percentage of our employee base working in a cost of services capacity versus sg&a and a prior year stock-based compensation charge of $16.4 million from the vesting of market metrics and streetaccount performance-based options. of our total employee headcount increase in fiscal 2014, 79% derived from our software engineering, content collection and product development teams, which are all included within cost of services. as such, sg&a employee compensation declined compared to the growth in cost of services.
partially offsetting the overall decrease in sg&a expenses was higher t&e expense, which rose by 20 basis points when expressed as a percentage of revenues. the primary drivers for this increase were more client visits by our salesforce, higher plane and hotel prices and increased interoffice travel due to our expanding worldwide presence.
operating income and operating margin fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014
operating income increased 9.8% to $331.9 million in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year. our operating margin for fiscal 2015 was 33.0%, up from 32.8% a year ago. operating margin in fiscal 2015 was negatively impacted by a $3.2 million pre-tax charge related to changes in the senior leadership of our sales teams and a $3.0 million pre-tax charge primarily related to the vesting of performance-based equity instruments. operating income in fiscal 2014 included $3.0 million of pre-tax charges related to vesting of performance-based equity instruments and the settlement of a legal claim. excluding these charges, our fiscal 2015 adjusted operating margin was 33.6% compared to the fiscal 2014 adjusted operating margin of 33.2%. revenue growth of 9.4% and net foreign currency benefits totaling of $11.2 million aided our current year operating margin expansion.
fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
operating income increased 12.2% to $302.2 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. our operating margin for fiscal 2014 was 32.8%, up from 31.4% in fiscal 2013. operating income reported in fiscal 2013 includes a market metrics and streetaccount performance-based stock option charge of $18.3 million ($1.9 million within cost of services and $16.4 million in sg&a), which reduced our operating margin by 210 basis points. the fiscal 2014 operating margin was 70 basis points lower than the fiscal 2013 adjusted operating margin of 33.5% (as calculated by adding back the $18.3 million stock-based compensation charge), due to higher t&e expenses, a rise in third-party data costs, incremental employee compensation within cost of services and impact from our revere and matrix acquisitions, which lowered the fiscal 2014 operating margin by 80 basis points. these reductions were partially offset by a 7.3% increase in revenues, a reduction in computer-related expenses and lower sg&a employee compensation.

our operating segments are aligned with how we manage the business and the demographic markets in which we serve. our internal financial reporting structure is based on three reportable segments, u.s., europe and asia pacific, which we believe helps us better manage the business and view the markets we serve. sales, consulting, data collection, product development and software engineering are the primary functional groups within each segment. each segment records compensation expense, including stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of furniture and fixtures, amortization of leasehold improvements, communication costs, professional fees, rent expense, travel, marketing, office and other direct expenses. expenditures associated with our data centers, third party data costs and corporate headquarters charges are recorded by the u.s. segment and are not allocated to the other segments. the content collection centers located in india and the philippines benefit all of our segments and thus the expenses incurred at these locations are allocated to each segment based on a percentage of revenues.
fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014
operating income from our u.s. business advanced 4.8% to $173.0 million during fiscal 2015 compared to $165.0 million a year ago. the increase in operating income is primarily attributable to $54.1 million of incremental revenues and a decrease in computer depreciation partially offset by a rise in employee compensation expense. u.s. revenue growth was driven by increases in the number of users and clients of factset within the u.s., a rise in sales of our pa suite of products, continued demand for our proprietary content, $5.2 million of incremental revenue from the acquisition of code red and a strong performance by our u.s. investment management sales team. excluding the acquired code red workforce, u.s. employee headcount increased 7.0% over the prior year, leading to higher employee compensation costs during fiscal 2015. computer-related expenses decreased due to the transition to more efficient and cost-effective servers in our data centers in addition to the continued use of fully depreciated servers.
european operating income increased 15.2% during fiscal 2015 to $116.3 million due to revenue growth of 10.6% and the effects of favorable foreign currency fluctuations on our expense base partially offset by increases in employee compensation, third-party data costs and occupancy expenses. the higher employee compensation costs were due to a 17.5% increase in headcount over the prior year. the increase in occupancy costs, which includes rent expense, was due to an increase in leased space, in london. finally, the increased third-party data costs were due to the increased number of users year over year as many of our data contracts are driven by our user and client count.
asia pacific operating income increased 17.5% to $42.6 million compared to $36.3 million a year ago. the increase was due to incremental revenues of $8.2 million and the effects of favorable foreign currency fluctuations on our expense base, partially offset by higher employee compensation. the higher employee compensation costs were due an 11.0% increase in headcount from the prior year.
fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
operating income from our u.s. business rose 19.0% to $165.0 million during fiscal 2014 compared to $138.7 million in fiscal 2013. the increase in operating income is attributable to $37.8 million of incremental revenues, a decrease in computer-related expenses, including computer depreciation and a fiscal 2013 pre-tax charge of $18.3 million related to the vesting of performance-based stock options, which did not recur in fiscal 2014. of the total pre-tax stock-based compensation charge of $18.3 million, $18.1 million was recorded within the u.s. segment as it related to primarily u.s.-based businesses. operating income growth was partially offset by increases in employee compensation within cost of services, a rise in t&e expenses, incremental legal fees, and additional expenses from the revere acquisition. u.s. revenue growth was driven by an increase in the number of clients and users of factset, the continued use of our advanced applications such as pa and growth in sales of wealth management. excluding the acquired revere workforce, u.s. employee headcount increased 6.8% in fiscal 2014 leading to higher employee compensation costs. computer-related expenses decreased due to the transition to more efficient and cost-effective servers in our data centers in addition to the continued use of fully depreciated servers. additional expenses from the acquisition of revere lowered u.s. operating income by $1.0 million for fiscal 2014.
european operating income advanced 70 basis points during fiscal 2014 to $100.9 million due to revenue growth of 8.9% partially offset by increases in employee compensation and the impact of the matrix acquisition. additional expenses from the acquisition of matrix lowered european operating income by $2.1 million.

income taxes fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014
the fiscal 2015 provision for income taxes was $92.7 million, up from $91.9 million a year ago. the 0.9% increase was due to a 10.0% increase in pre-tax income offset by the reenactment of the u.s. federal r&d tax credit in december 2014. the reenactment of the credit was retroactive to january 1, 2014 and extended through the end of the 2014 calendar year. prior to the reenactment of the tax credit, we had not been permitted to factor it into our effective tax rate because it was not enacted tax law. the reenactment resulted in a discrete income tax benefit of $5.1 million during fiscal 2015. additionally, we recognized tax benefits of $3.7 million related to finalizing prior year tax returns and other discrete tax items.
fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
the fiscal 2014 provision for income taxes was $91.9 million, up $19.6 million or 27.2% from $72.3 million in fiscal 2013. this increase was due to a 12.0% increase in pre-tax income and the expiration of the u.s. federal r&d tax credit on december 31, 2013, which limited our ability to realize income tax benefits from the r&d tax credit to only four out of twelve months during fiscal 2014.
net income and diluted earnings per share fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014
net income increased 13.9% to $241.1 million and diluted earnings per share increased 16.1% to $5.71 during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. drivers of the increase in net income and earnings per share during fiscal 2015 include revenue growth of 9.4%, income tax benefits of $8.8 million, foreign currency benefits of $4.0 million and a decrease in diluted shares outstanding of 1.7%. these net income drivers were partially offset by incremental employee compensation expense within cost of services due to the hiring of 721 net new employees during the last 12 months and after-tax charges of $2.2 million and $2.1 million related to changes in the senior leadership of our sales teams and the vesting of performance-based equity instruments, respectively.
fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
net income increased 6.5% to $211.5 million and diluted earnings per share increased 10.6% to $4.92 during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. drivers of the increase included a 7.3% rise in revenues, lower stock-based compensation as a result of the fiscal 2013 after-tax charge of $12.9 million and a 3.7% decrease in diluted shares outstanding from share repurchases. these increases were partially offset by a higher annual effective tax rate from the expiration of the u.s. federal r&d tax credit, incremental employee compensation within cost of services due to the hiring of 202 net new software engineers and 70 net new consultants, a rise in third party data costs from additional users and clients added and higher employee t&e.

fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014
cash and cash equivalents aggregated to $158.9 million or 22% of our total assets at august 31, 2015, compared with $116.4 million or 18% of our total assets august 31, 2014. our cash and cash equivalents increased $42.5 million during fiscal 2015 due to cash provided by operations of $306.4 million, $71.5 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, $35.0 million in proceeds from long-term debt and $28.9 million in tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. these cash inflows are partially offset by $34.8 million in cash paid to acquire businesses, $252.8 million in share repurchases, dividend payments of $66.6 million, capital expenditures of $25.7 million and purchases of investments, net of proceeds, of $4.4 million.
free cash flow for fiscal 2015 was $280.8 million, exceeding net income by 16%. free cash flow generated during fiscal 2015 was attributable to $241.1 million of net income, $37.6 million of positive working capital changes and $27.8 million in non-cash expenses less $25.7 million in capital expenditures. working capital improvements were derived from lower income tax payments and increased accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of payments partially offset by a rise in accounts receivable compared to the prior year. the rise in accounts receivable was due to our year over year revenue growth. our accounts receivable balance as of august 31, 2015 rose by only 5.2% compared to the year ago period, while revenue growth grew by 9.4% year over year. this fact pattern was primarily due to a decrease in our days sales outstanding ("dso"), which was lowered to 33 days as of august 31, 2015 compared to 34 days as of august 31, 2014.
net cash used in investing activities was $64.9 million during fiscal 2015, a decrease of $5.8 million over the prior year due to a $12.1 million decrease in cash used in business acquisitions and a $1.7 million increase in proceeds from sales of short-term investments, net of purchases, partially offset by a $7.9 million increase in cash used for capital expenditures.
net cash used in financing activities was $187.3 million during fiscal 2015. of this total, $252.8 million related to the repurchase of 1.7 million shares under the existing share repurchase program and $66.6 million was for the payment of regular quarterly dividends. partially offsetting these uses of cash were proceeds received from employee stock plans totaling $71.5 million, related tax benefits of $28.9 million and long-term debt of $35.0 million. net cash used in financing activities was $89.4 million lower in the current year due to a $36.3 million increase in proceeds from employee stock option exercises and its related income tax benefits, proceeds from long-term debt of $35.0 million and a decrease in share repurchases of $23.6 million. these positive cash movements were partially offset by an incremental $5.5 million in dividend payments due to the 12.8% increase in our regular quarterly dividend, beginning in may 2015.
we expect that for at least the next 12 months, our operating expenses will continue to constitute a significant use of our cash. additionally, to fund our acquisition of portware, llc ("portware"), announced on september 22, 2015, and closed on october 16, 2015, we entered into an amendment (the "second amendment") dated as of september 21, 2015, amending and expanding the existing credit agreement dated february 6, 2015 and borrowed an additional $265.0 million on october 16, 2015. the maturity date on all outstanding loan amounts is september 21, 2018. for more information on the portware acquisition, see note 21, subsequent events, in the notes to the company's consolidated financial statements included in item 8.

as of august 31, 2015, our total cash and cash equivalents worldwide was $158.9 million with $35.0 million in outstanding borrowings. approximately $35.5 million of our total available cash and cash equivalents is held in bank accounts located within the u.s., $93.2 million in europe (predominantly within the uk and france) and the remaining $30.2 million is held in asia pacific. we believe our liquidity (including cash on hand, cash from operating activities and other cash flows that we expect to generate) within each geographic segment will be sufficient to meet our short-term and longer-term operating requirements, as they occur, including working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend payments, stock repurchases and financing activities. in addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalent and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
cash and cash equivalents aggregated to $116.4 million or 18% of our total assets at august 31, 2014, compared with $196.6 million or 28% of our total assets august 31, 2013. our cash and cash equivalents decreased $80.2 million during fiscal 2014 due to $46.9 million in cash used to acquire revere and matrix, $279.8 million in share repurchases, dividend payments of $61.0 million, capital expenditures of $17.7 million, and purchases of investments, net of proceeds, of $6.1 million. these cash outflows are partially offset by cash provided by operations of $265.0 million, $52.2 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, $12.0 million in tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements and $2.2 million from the effects of foreign currency.
free cash flow for fiscal 2014 was $247.3 million, exceeding net income by 17%. free cash flow generated during fiscal 2014 was attributable to $211.5 million of net income, $9.2 million of positive working capital changes and $44.3 million in non-cash expenses less $17.7 million in capital expenditures. working capital improvements were derived from lower income tax payments partially offset by a rise in accounts receivable compared to the prior year. employee stock option exercises, which reduced our tax payments, improved current year working capital. however, our days sales outstanding ("dso") as of august 31, 2014 rose to 34 days, up from a record low of 30 days a year ago primarily due to timing of large client payments in the prior year period.
net cash used in investing activities of $70.7 million, an increase of $50.3 million over fiscal 2013, is due to the acquisitions of revere and matrix for $46.9 million and a $4.8 million increase in cash utilized to purchase additional short-term certificates of deposit.
net cash used in financing activities was $276.7 million during fiscal 2014. of this total, $275.4 million related to the repurchase of 2.5 million shares under the existing share repurchase program and $61.0 million was for the payment of quarterly dividends. partially offsetting the use of cash were proceeds received from employee stock plans totaling $52.2 million and related tax benefits of $12.0 million. net cash used in financing activities was $38.3 million higher in the current year because of an $85.7 million reduction in proceeds from employee stock option exercises and an incremental $5.0 million in dividend repayments due to the 11% increase in our regular quarterly dividend. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in share repurchases of $52.3 million. proceeds from employee stock exercises and its related income tax benefits were lower in the current year because the number of employee stock options exercised decreased by 1.5 million shares.
capital resources capital expenditures capital expenditures were $25.7 million during fiscal 2015, up from $17.7 million a year ago. approximately $13.8 million, or 54%, of our capital expenditures during fiscal 2015 were for purchase of computer equipment, including more servers for our existing data centers, purchasing laptop computers and peripherals for employees, upgrading existing computer systems and improving telecommunication equipment. the remaining 46% of our capital expenditures were used to build out our offices primarily in new york, texas and the philippines during fiscal 2015.
capital expenditures were $17.7 million during fiscal 2014, down from $18.5 million in fiscal 2013. approximately $13.8 million or 78% of capital expenditures during fiscal 2014 related to the purchase of computer equipment including more servers for our existing data centers, purchasing laptop computers and peripherals for employees, upgrading existing computer systems in our data collection centers in india and the philippines and improving telecommunication equipment. the remaining 22% of capital expenditures was used primarily to build out our san francisco office during fiscal 2014.
capital needs long-term debt on february 6, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement (the "credit agreement") between factset, as the borrower, and bank of america, n.a., as the lender (the "lender"). at that date, the credit agreement provided for a $35.0 million revolving credit facility (the "revolving credit facility"), under which we could request borrowings until its maturity date of february 6, 2018. the credit agreement also allowed us to arrange for additional borrowings for an aggregate amount of up to $265.0 million provided that any such request for additional borrowings was in a minimum amount of $25.0 million.
33
for purposes of funding our acquisition of code red on february 6, 2015, we borrowed $35.0 million in the form of a eurodollar rate loan (the "loan") under the revolving credit facility. the proceeds of the loan made under the credit agreement could be used for permitted acquisitions and general corporate purposes. there are no prepayment penalties if we elect to prepay the loan prior to its scheduled maturity date. the principal balance is payable in full on the maturity date. the $35.0 million we borrowed under the loan bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to the eurodollar rate plus 0.50% and is reported as long-term debt within our consolidated balance sheet at august 31, 2015. the eurodollar rate is defined in the credit agreement as the rate per annum equal to one-month libor. interest on the loan is payable quarterly in arrears and on the maturity date. during fiscal 2015 we paid approximately $0.1 million in interest on our outstanding loan amount.
on september 21, 2015, we amended the credit agreement to borrow an additional $265.0 million (the "second amendment") in order to fund our acquisition of portware, which was announced on september 22, 2015, and closed on october 16, 2015. the maturity date on all outstanding loan amounts (which total $300.0 million as of october 30, 2015) is september 21, 2018. the second amendment also allows factset, subject to certain requirements, to arrange for additional borrowings with the lender for an aggregate amount of up to $400.0 million, provided that any such request for additional borrowings must be in a minimum amount of $25.0 million.
as of august 31, 2015, we owed no commitment fees since we borrowed the then-full amount of the revolving credit facility on february 6, 2015. other fees incurred, such as legal costs to draft and review the credit agreement, totaled less than $0.1 million and were capitalized as loan origination fees. these loan origination fees are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan using the effective interest method and totaled less than $0.1 million in fiscal 2015.
the credit agreement contains covenants restricting certain factset activities, which are usual and customary for this type of loan. in addition, the credit agreement requires that we maintain a consolidated leverage ratio, as measured by total funded debt/ebitda below a specified level as of the end of each fiscal quarter. we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the credit agreement as of august 31, 2015.
as of august 31, 2015, the fair value of our long-term debt was $35.0 million, which we believe approximates carrying amount as the terms and interest rates approximate market rates given its floating interest rate basis.
letters of credit from time to time, we are required to obtain letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. approximately $1.0 million of standby letters of credit have been issued in connection with our current leased office space as of august 31, 2015. these standby letters of credit contain covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain minimum levels of consolidated net worth and certain leverage and fixed charge ratios. as of august 31, 2015 and 2014, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the standby letters of credit.
foreign currency foreign currency exposure certain wholly owned subsidiaries within the european and asia pacific segments operate under a functional currency different from the u.s. dollar. the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses. translation gains and losses that arise from translating assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders' equity.
our non-u.s. dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next twelve months are estimated to be $30.7 million while our non-u.s. dollar denominated expenses are estimated to be $205.4 million, which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of $174.7 million. our foreign currency exchange exposure is related to our operating expense base in countries outside the u.s., where approximately 70% of our employees are located as of august 31, 2015. during fiscal 2015, foreign currency movements increased operating income by $11.2 million as compared to a $1.7 million decrease to operating income during fiscal 2014.
foreign currency hedges as of august 31, 2015, we maintained the following foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure:
●   indian rupee - foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 75% of our indian rupee exposure through the second quarter of fiscal 2018.

34
●   british pound sterling - foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 50% of our british pound sterling exposure through the second quarter of fiscal 2016.

●   euro - foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 50% of our euro exposure through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.

as of august 31, 2015, the gross notional value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase indian rupees with u.s. dollars was rs. 4.0 billion. the gross notional value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase british pound sterling with u.s. dollars was £10.5 million. the gross notional value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase euros with u.s. dollars was €18.1 million. there were no other outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts as of august 31, 2015. a loss on derivatives of $0.6 million was recorded into operating income during fiscal 2015, compared to a loss of $0.3 million a year ago.
off-balance sheet arrangements at august 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no off-balance sheet financing or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships (such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities) established for purposes of facilitating off-balance sheet financing or other debt arrangements or for other contractually limited purposes.
share repurchase program on december 15, 2014, our board of directors approved a $300 million expansion of the existing share repurchase program. repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market and privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions. no minimum number of shares to be repurchased has been fixed. there is no timeframe to complete the repurchase program and it is expected that share repurchases will be paid from existing and future cash generated by operations.
during fiscal 2015, we repurchased 1.7 million shares for $252.8 million under the existing share repurchase program as compared to 2.5 million shares for $275.4 million during fiscal 2014. including the expansion, $134.2 million remains authorized for future share repurchases as of august 31, 2015.
contractual obligations fluctuations in our operating results, the degree of success of our accounts receivable collection efforts, the timing of tax and other payments as well as necessary capital expenditures to support growth of our operations will impact our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. the effect of our contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be considered in conjunction with the factors mentioned here.
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of august 31, 2015 and the corresponding effect that these obligations will have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in millions):

(1)   operating lease amounts include future minimum lease payments under all our non-cancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year. for more information on our operating leases, see note 18, commitments and contingencies, in the notes to the company's consolidated financial statements included in item 8.

(2)   purchase commitments represent payment due in future periods in respect of obligations to our various data vendors as well as commitments to purchase goods and services such as telecommunication and computer maintenance services.

(3)   represents the amount due under the company's loan under its revolving credit facility entered into on february 6, 2015.

(4)   non-current income taxes payable of $6.8 million and non-current deferred tax liabilities of $1.7 million have been excluded in the table above due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future payments.

purchase orders do not necessarily reflect a binding commitment but are merely indicative of authorizations and intention to conclude purchases in the future. for the purpose of this tabular disclosure, purchase obligations for goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. it is expected that all the contractual obligations noted in the table will be funded from existing cash and cash flows from operations. expected timing pertaining to the contractual obligations included in the table above has been estimated based on information currently available. the amounts paid and the timing of those payments may differ based on when the goods and services provided by our vendors to whom we are contractually obligated are actually received as well as due to changes to agreed-upon amounts for any of our obligations.

as disclosed earlier in the capital resources section of this md&a, we borrowed $35.0 million in the form of a eurodollar rate loan to fund the acquisition of code red in february 2015. the $35.0 million loan matures on september 21, 2018, and there are no prepayment penalties in the event that we elect to prepay the loan prior to its scheduled maturity date. the amount borrowed bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to the eurodollar rate plus 0.50% and is reported as long-term debt within our consolidated balance sheet at august 31, 2015.
dividends on may 12, 2015, our board of directors approved a 12.8% increase in the regular quarterly dividend, beginning with the dividend payment in june 2015 which was $0.44 per share, or $1.76 per share per annum. this is the 10th consecutive year that our annual dividend has been increased by more than 10%, resulting in a five year annual dividend growth rate of 14%. with our dividends and share repurchases, in the aggregate, we have returned $322.8 million to stockholders over the past 12 months.
during fiscal years 2015 and 2014, our board of directors declared the following dividends:

all of the above cash dividends were paid from existing cash resources. future cash dividends will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by us and is subject to final determination by our board of directors.
significant accounting policies we describe our significant accounting policies in note 3, summary of significant accounting policies, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 below.
critical accounting estimates we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. in addition, there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements.
business combinations we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. all of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent consideration are recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date. the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. our estimates are based on historical experience, information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and when appropriate, includes assistance from independent third party appraisal firms. our significant assumptions and estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. in addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates.
36
performance-based equity awards we have an employee stock-based compensation plan, which allows for the issuance of performance-based equity awards to employees. accounting guidance requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all performance-based equity awards made to employees based on the estimated fair values of the awards that are expected to vest. at the end of each reporting period, management must make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving our performance targets because the number of stock options that vest will be predicated on us achieving these levels. however, there is no current guarantee that such options will vest in whole or in part.
july 2012 performance-based option grant review in july 2012, we granted 241,546 performance-based employee stock options, which are eligible to vest in 20% tranches depending upon future streetaccount user growth through august 31, 2017. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the first growth target as outlined within the terms of the grant was achieved, thus 20% or 48,314 options vested on august 31, 2013. the second 20% tranche vested on august 31, 2014 as a result of accelerated expansion of street account users during fiscal 2014. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, the third growth target was achieved, thus the third 20% tranche vested on august 31, 2015. as of august 31, 2015, we estimate that the fourth 20% tranche will vest by august 31, 2017, resulting in unamortized stock-based compensation expense of $0.6 million to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of 2.0 years. a change, up or down, in the actual financial performance levels achieved by streetaccount in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense (in thousands):
vesting                           cumulative          remaining expense percentage                    catch-up adjustment*      to be recognized

fourth 20% tranche (current expectation)                        $0                  $619
fifth 20% tranche                                           $1,216                $1,003
* amounts represent the cumulative catch-up adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of august 31, 2015.
november 2012 annual employee performance-based option grant review in november 2012, we granted 1,011,510 performance-based employee stock options. the number of performance-based options that would become eligible to vest was based upon the company achieving performance levels for both organic asv and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years ended august 31, 2014. based upon the actual growth in organic asv and diluted eps through august 31, 2014, 20%, or 185,014 (net of options forfeited through the end of fiscal 2014), of the previously granted shares became eligible to vest on august 31, 2014. the remaining 80% of the performance-based options previously granted were recorded as forfeitures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. as of the end of fiscal 2015, total unamortized stock-based compensation expense of $0.9 million will be recognized over the remaining vesting period of 2.1 years in connection with this grant.
february 2015 performance-based option grant review in connection with our acquisition of code red during the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we granted 137,522 performance-based stock options. these performance-based options are eligible to vest four years from date of grant if certain code red asv and operating margin targets are achieved over the measurement period. the option holders must also remain employed by factset to be eligible to vest. of the total grant, 68,761 performance-based options are eligible for vesting based on achieving the growth targets over a four year measurement period ending february 28, 2019 and the remaining 68,761 options are eligible to cliff vest based on a two year measurement period ending february 28, 2017. as of august 31, 2015, total unamortized stock-based compensation of $2.1 million will be recognized as expense over the remaining vesting period of 3.4 years. a change, up or down, in the actual financial performance levels achieved by code red in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense (in thousands):
vesting                   cumulative              remaining expense percentage            catch-up adjustment*          to be recognized

other performance-based option grants in connection with the acquisitions of matrix and revere, we granted 165,949 and 36,695 performance-based stock options, respectively, during fiscal 2014. the performance-based options granted in connection with the acquisition of matrix will vest only if asv and operating margin targets related to the matrix business are met during a five year measurement period ending december 23, 2018, and the option holders remain employed by factset. as of august 31, 2015 we do not believe these targets are probable of being achieved, and as such, no stock-based compensation expense is expected to be realized in connection with these options. of the 36,695 performance-based stock options granted in connection with the revere acquisition, 18,553 options became eligible to vest based upon the achievement of certain asv and operating margins during the measurement period ending august 31, 2015. this results in unamortized stock-based compensation expense of $0.4 million to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of 3.0 years. of the remaining 18,142 performance-based options previously granted, 6,184 were recorded as forfeitures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 while the remaining 11,958 vest 80% after four years if the measurement criterion is achieved over the four year period ending august 31, 2017.

accrued compensation we make significant estimates in determining our accrued compensation. approximately 15% of our total employee compensation is variable and discretionary. we conduct a final review of company and departmental individual performance each year end to determine the amount of discretionary employee compensation. we also review compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance tracks against management's expectations. management takes these and other factors, including historical performance, into account in reviewing accrued compensation estimates quarterly and adjusting accrual rates as appropriate. the amount of the variable employee compensation recorded within accrued compensation was $38.6 million and $37.3 million as of august 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
long-lived assets long-lived assets, comprised of property, equipment and leasehold improvements are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may cause an impairment review include significant changes in technology that make current computer-related assets that we use in our operations obsolete or less useful and significant changes in the way we use these assets in our operations. when evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset's carrying value exceeds the asset's estimated fair value. if we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset. using the impairment evaluation methodology described herein, there have been no long-lived asset impairment charges for each of the last three years. the carrying value of long-lived assets as of august 31, 2015 and 2014 was $59.3 million and $57.6 million, respectively.
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.
goodwill and intangible assets we are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators occur. the impairment test requires management to make judgments in connection with identifying reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. factset has three reporting units, which are consistent with the operating segments reported as there is no discrete financial information available for the subsidiaries within each operating segment. the reporting units evaluated for potential impairment were the u.s., europe and asia pacific, which reflects the level of internal reporting we use to manage our business and operations.
we complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses and consider other publicly available market information. goodwill is tested for impairment based on the present value of discounted cash flows, and, if impaired, written down to fair value based on discounted cash flows. this analysis contains uncertainties as it requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors including market conditions, legal and technological factors and the profitability of future business strategies. it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations. we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment losses. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material. future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment do exist and that goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions is impaired, which could result in an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income and a write-down of the related asset.
38
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, consistent with previous years, at which time it was determined that there were no indications of impairment, with the fair value of each of the company's reporting units significantly exceeding carrying value. the carrying value of goodwill as of august 31, 2015 and 2014 was $308.3 million and $285.6 million, respectively.
intangible assets consist of certain acquired content databases, client relationships, software technology, non-compete agreements and trade names resulting from previous acquisitions and depending on the nature of the intangible asset, are amortized on either a straight-line or an accelerated basis using estimated useful lives ranging between two and twenty years. the remaining useful lives of intangible assets subject to amortization are evaluated quarterly to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. if the estimate of the remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. there were no adjustments to the useful lives of intangible assets subject to amortization during any of the periods presented. these intangible assets have no assigned residual values as of august 31, 2015 and 2014. intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. measurement of any impairment loss for intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. no impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented. the carrying value of intangible assets as of august 31, 2015 and 2014 was $40.1 million and $41.9 million, respectively. our ongoing consideration of the recoverability could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
estimated tax provision and tax contingencies we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions. these laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business including ours. the tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes. our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes, foreign operations, r&d and other tax credits, tax audit settlements, incentive-stock options and domestic production activities deductions. our annual effective tax rate was 27.8%, 30.3% and 26.7% in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
we recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position as of the reporting date. otherwise, no benefit can be recognized. the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. we will classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that we anticipate payment (or receipt) of cash within one year. additionally, we accrue interest on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws. interest is classified as income tax expense in the financial statements.
as of august 31, 2015, we have gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling $6.8 million, including $1.3 million of accrued interest, recorded as non-current taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheet. unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions taken on tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements. when applicable, we adjust the previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results when the position is effectively settled. if recognized, the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest would be recorded as a benefit to tax expense on the consolidated statement of income. audits by multiple tax authorities are currently ongoing. significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. for this reason, we regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest.
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by numerous factors such as changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations of them. significant judgment is required to determine recognition and measurement. further, as a result of certain ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. our failure to meet these commitments could adversely affect our provision for income taxes. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.

new accounting pronouncements see note 3, summary of significant accounting policies, in the notes to the company's consolidated financial statements included in item 8 for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption, which we include here by reference.
management changes our chairman and ceo, philip hadley, stepped down as ceo effective july 1, 2015. he remains an employee of factset and continues to serve as our chairman of the board of directors. mr. hadley, age 53, has served as our ceo since september 2000. our president, 19-year factset veteran philip snow, was named ceo, effective july 1, 2015. mr. snow, age 51, was also elected to our board of directors, effective march 16, 2015.
in addition, on january 21, 2015, we hired scott miller as our new executive vice president, global director of sales. mr. miller succeeded michael frankenfield and reports directly to mr. snow. mr. frankenfield, who has been with factset since 1989 and had been in his current role since 2009, remains with us as a vice chairman and works in a senior executive sales advisory position. in addition, on march 16, 2015, we appointed mark hale as our new executive vice president, chief operating officer. mr. hale succeeded peter walsh and reports directly to mr. snow. mr. walsh, who has been with factset since 1999 and had been in his current role since 2009, remains with us focusing on various discrete projects.
lastly, in june 2015, we hired edward baker-greene, our first-ever chief human resources officer, to oversee and grow our critically important employee talent pool.
market trends in the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to financial risks involving foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations. major equity indices continue to experience volatility. approximately 82.5% of our asv is derived from our investment management clients. the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management. an equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests to move money out of equities and into other asset classes. moreover, extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation, resulting in lower demand for services from investment managers.
our investment banking clients that perform m&a advisory work, provide capital markets services and equity research, account for approximately 17.5% of our asv. a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by large, bulge bracket banks. credit continues to impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations. a lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in merger and acquisitions funded by debt. additional uncertainty, consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect our financial results and future growth.
we service m&a departments, capital markets and equity research. these are low risk businesses that do not deploy leverage and will likely continue to operate far into the future and should represent a larger percentage of the overall revenues of our clients. regardless, the size of banks in general is shrinking as they deleverage their balance sheets and adjust their expense bases to future revenue opportunities. our revenues may decline if banks including those involved in recent merger activity significantly reduce headcount in the areas of corporate m&a, capital markets and equity research to compensate for the issues created by other departments.

first quarter fiscal 2016 expectations (includes the impact from the acquisition of portware, which was completed on october 16, 2015)
-   revenues are expected to range between $270 million and $274 million.

-   operating margin is expected to range between 32.0% and 33.0%.

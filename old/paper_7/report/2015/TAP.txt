item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is provided to assist in understanding our company, operations and current business environment and should be considered a supplement to, and read in conjunction with, the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes included within part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, as well as the discussion of our business and related risk factors in part i-item 1 business and part i-item 1a risk factors, respectively.
our fiscal year unless otherwise indicated, (a) all $ amounts are in u.s. dollars ("usd"), (b) comparisons are to comparable prior periods, and (c) 2015 refers to the 12 months ended december 31, 2015, 2014 refers to the 12 months ended december 31, 2014, and 2013 refers to the period from december 30, 2012 through december 31, 2013. the impact of the three additional days in fiscal year 2013 is immaterial to the consolidated financial statements and is a result of changing our fiscal year from a 52/53 week fiscal year to a calendar year in 2013.
use of non-gaap measures in addition to financial measures presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("u.s. gaap"), we also present pretax and after-tax "underlying income," "underlying income per diluted share," "underlying effective tax rate," and "underlying free cash flow," which are non-gaap measures and should be viewed as supplements to (not substitutes for) our results of operations presented under u.s. gaap. we also present underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("underlying ebitda") as a non-gaap measure. our management uses underlying income, underlying income per diluted share, underlying ebitda, underlying effective tax rate and underlying free cash flow as measures of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis; as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations; in communications with the board of directors, stockholders, analysts and investors concerning our financial performance; as useful comparisons to the performance of our competitors; and as metrics of certain management incentive compensation calculations. we believe that underlying income, underlying income per diluted share, underlying ebitda, underlying effective tax rate and underlying free cash flow performance are used by and are useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because they provide an additional tool to evaluate our performance without regard to special and non-core items, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets and capital structure. we have provided reconciliations of all non-gaap measures to their nearest u.s. gaap measure and have consistently applied the adjustments within our reconciliations in arriving at each non-gaap measure. these adjustments consist of special items from our u.s. gaap financial statements (see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 1, "basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements ("notes") for additional disclosure) as well as other non-core items, such as acquisition and integration related costs, unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses, and gains and losses on sales of non-operating assets, included in our u.s. gaap results that warrant adjustment to arrive at non-gaap results. we consider these items to be necessary adjustments for purposes of evaluating our ongoing business performance and are often considered non-recurring. such adjustments are subjective and involve significant management judgment.
in addition to the non-gaap measures noted above, we have certain operational measures, such as sales-to-wholesalers ("stws") and sales-to-retailers ("strs"), which we believe are useful metrics to management and investors in evaluating our operations. stw is a metric that we use in our u.s. business to reflect the sales from our operations to our direct customers, generally wholesalers. we believe the stw metric is important because it gives an indication of the amount of beer and adjacent products that we have produced and shipped to customers. str is a metric that we use in our canada and u.s. businesses to refer to sales closer to the end consumer than stws, which generally means sales from our wholesalers or our company to retailers, who in turn sell to consumers. we believe the str metric is important because, unlike stws, it provides the closest indication of the performance of our brands in relation to market and competitor sales trends.

pending acquisition on november 11, 2015, anheuser-busch inbev sa/nv's ("abi") announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire sabmiller plc ("sabmiller"). the resulting transaction ("abi/sabmiller transaction") is expected to be finalized in the second half of 2016 subject to abi and sabmiller shareholder approval and various global regulatory approvals. concurrently, on november 11, 2015, we entered into a purchase agreement (the "purchase agreement") with abi to acquire, contingent upon the closing of the abi/sabmiller transaction, all of sabmiller's 58% economic interest and 50% voting interest in millercoors and all trademarks, contracts and other assets primarily related to the miller brand portfolio outside of the u.s. and puerto rico for $12.0 billion in cash, subject to downward adjustment as described in the purchase agreement (the "acquisition"). following the closing of the pending acquisition, we will own 100% of the outstanding equity and voting interests of millercoors. the pending acquisition is based on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the purchase agreement, as incorporated herein by reference as exhibit 2.4 of part iv item 15.
under the agreement, we will retain the rights to all of the brands currently in the millercoors portfolio for the u.s. and puerto rican markets, including import brands such as peroni and pilsner urquell, as well as full ownership of the miller brand portfolio outside of the u.s. and puerto rico. additionally, in consolidating control of millercoors, we will further improve our scale and agility, benefit from significantly enhanced cash flows, and capture substantial operational synergies. the purchase of the miller brand trademarks outside of the u.s. and puerto rico provides a strategic opportunity to leverage the iconic miller trademark globally alongside molson coors' trademarks for coors and staropramen and presents volume and profit growth opportunities for molson coors in both core markets, as well as emerging markets.
the pending acquisition is expected to be funded through cash on hand and financed through a combination of debt and equity security issuances. further, as we plan to elect to treat the acquisition as an asset acquisition for u.s. tax purposes, we expect to receive substantial cash tax benefits for the first 15 years after completion. at this time, we anticipate this acquisition will close in the second half of 2016, subject to necessary regulatory approvals and contingent on the successful closing of the abi/sabmiller transaction.
executive summary we are one of the world's largest brewers and have a diverse portfolio of owned and partner brands, including core brands carling, coors light, molson canadian and staropramen, as well as craft and specialty beers such as blue moon, creemore springs, cobra and doom bar. with centuries of brewing heritage, we have been crafting high-quality, innovative products with the purpose of delighting the world's beer drinkers and goal to be the first choice for our consumers and customers. our success depends on our ability to make our products available to meet a wide range of consumer segments and occasions.
in 2015, our net income from continuing operations attributable to mcbc, underlying after-tax earnings and ebitda declined versus 2014 due to a number of challenges; however, we exceeded our targets for cost savings and cash generation and achieved positive net pricing in most of our major markets, excluding the impacts of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. competitive challenges and weak consumer demand continued across some of our largest markets, but we continued to focus on building a stronger brand portfolio, delivering value-added innovation and strengthening our core brand positions through incremental marketing investments. our focus on growing our above-premium segment continued this year as we completed the acquisitions of saint archer brewing company in the u.s. and the rights to the rekorderlig cider brand in the u.k. and repatriated the rights to staropramen in the u.k. we also expanded our global footprint within mci through the acquisition of mount shivalik breweries ltd. ("mount shivalik") in india and our recent entrance into the colombian market. we continued to improve our sales execution and revenue management capabilities, increase the efficiency of our operations, implement common systems and focus on generating higher returns for our invested capital, managing our working capital and delivering a greater return on investment for our shareholders. we grew our global above-premium volume, net pricing and sales mix. our craft portfolio drove growth from doom bar in the u.k., grandville island in canada and blue moon in the u.s. and u.k. our emerging cider portfolio delivered strong growth, led by molson canadian cider and strongbow in canada and smith & forge hard cider in the u.s. volume challenges included coors light performance in canada and the u.s., however, we continued to see strong performance of coors light in europe and mci.
2015 financial highlights:
•   net income from continuing operations attributable to mcbc of $355.6 million, or $1.91 per diluted share, decreased 30.7% and underlying after-tax income of $700.4 million, or $3.76 per diluted share, decreased 8.9% from a year ago, primarily due to the impact of unfavorable movements in foreign currency rates and the loss of major business contracts this year. additionally, net income from continuing operations attributable to mcbc was unfavorably impacted by incremental special charges in 2015 driven primarily by our initiatives focused on improving our supply chain network and building efficiencies across the business evidenced by our closure of two bottling lines in canada, as well as the closure of our alton and plovdiv breweries in europe and announced closures of the eden brewery in
35
the u.s. and the vancouver brewery in canada and we entered into a consultation process regarding our proposal to close the burton south brewery in europe. underlying ebitda decreased 9.5% compared to 2014, primarily due to a decrease in underlying income in canada and europe. our underlying income excludes special and other non-core gains, losses and expenses that net to a $420.9 million pretax charge, as explained below.
•   worldwide beer volume for mcbc in 2015 decreased 1.5% compared to 2014, primarily due to lower volumes in the u.s. and canada, partially offset by increased volumes from mci. additionally, consolidated net sales decreased 14.0% compared to 2014, driven by negative impacts of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and lower volumes in canada and the loss of the heineken and modelo contracts in europe, partially offset by positive pricing in europe.
•   we generated cash flow from operating activities of $696.4 million, representing a 45.3% decrease from $1,272.6 million in 2014 and a 40.4% decrease from $1,168.2 million in 2013. underlying free cash flow in 2015 was $704.3 million, compared to $956.7 million in 2014, representing a decrease of 26.4%. the decreases in operating cash flow and underlying free cash flow are driven by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased capital investments, higher cash paid for taxes and decreased distributions from our investment in millercoors, along with lower underlying income, after considering non-cash impairments and other non-cash add-backs. these increases were partially offset by a lower cash paid for interest and favorable impact of changes in net working capital.
•   regional financial highlights:
•   in our canada segment, we drove positive pricing, achieved significant cost savings and invested significantly behind our brands. our income from continuing operations before income taxes in canada decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 by 31.8% to $277.3 million, due to special charges recognized as a result of accelerated depreciation of two of our bottling lines, the impact of the loss of our miller brands agreements, as well as cycling the income received from the termination of our mmi joint venture in 2014. our 2015 underlying pretax income decreased by 16.6% to $304.5 million, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency movements and incremental brand investments, as well as lower volumes.
•   in the u.s., millercoors grew net sales per hectoliter with positive pricing and mix, while also working to restore growth to coors light and miller lite, which both grew share of segment versus 2014. we increased our percentage of volume in the above premium segment and experienced continued growth of higher-margin brands like redd's, blue moon and leinenkugel's shandy portfolio. our 2015 equity income in millercoors decreased 8.1% to $516.3 million, driven by special charges recognized in 2015 related to the decision to close the eden brewery, as well as the early settlement of a portion of millercoors' defined benefit pension plan liability. underlying equity income in millercoors of $562.5 million for 2015 remained relatively flat to 2014, as positive pricing and mix and cost savings offset lower volumes and higher marketing investments.
•   in our europe segment, we reported a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $109.7 million, versus a loss of $111.9 million in 2014. the losses are attributable to an impairment charge of $275.0 million recognized related to indefinite-lived intangible brand assets, along with charges related to our supply chain initiatives and net termination charges in 2015, compared to an impairment charge of $360.0 million in 2014. underlying income of $203.4 million decreased by 16.2%, compared to $242.7 million in 2014. the decrease in underlying income is entirely attributable to the negative impacts of unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates and the loss of the heineken and modelo contracts in 2015. excluding these factors, our europe segment grew volume, sales mix and gross margins. further, lower supply chain costs and lower spending driven by efficiency in marketing investments partially offset by higher brand amortization expense contributed to positive underlying results. in addition to the core brand performances mentioned below, our above-premium brands performed well, with coors light, doom bar and our wider craft portfolio, including franciscan well, achieving strong growth in the year, as did staropramen outside czech republic.
•   in our mci segment, we drove significant growth in terms of volume, particularly in our latin american markets including our entrance into the colombian market at the end of 2015. we also significantly grew our volume in india and increased our presence in the indian beer market through our acquisition of mount shivalik. our 2015 loss from continuing operations before income taxes increased by 86.5% to $24.8 million driven by special charges and expenses associated with our decision to restructure our china business. underlying pretax loss increased by 38.3% to $18.4 million primarily driven by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and expenses related to our china business, partially offset by higher volume and lower marketing investment and general and administrative costs.
36
•   core brand highlights:
•   carling, the number one beer brand in the u.k. and the largest brand in our europe segment, declined 3.6% in terms of volume in the year, primarily due to overall industry softness in the u.k., but gained share within its segment.
•   coors light global volume (including our proportional percentage of millercoors' coors light volumes) increased 0.3% in 2015 versus 2014, driven by strong performance in europe and mci, partially offset by declines in canada and the u.s. due to continued competitive and industry pressures. in the u.s., coors light increased its share of the premium light segment and gained momentum in 2015 versus 2014, continued to show strong volume growth in the u.k., where it is our second largest brand, and is growing even faster in our latin american markets, with double digit growth in 2015 versus 2014. coors light volume increased 0.8% in the fourth quarter of 2015 resulting from improved packing and advertising and incremental marketing investment.
•   molson canadian in canada decreased in terms of volume and market share in 2015 due to continued competitive pressures in the segment.
•   staropramen volume increased overall in 2015 versus 2014, mainly driven by strong growth in almost all countries outside of czech republic, staropramen's primary market, and the international markets of ukraine and russia due to industry declines in these markets.

2014, includes accelerated amortization expense of $4.9 million and accelerated depreciation expense of $4.0 million, which are included in our adjustments to arrive at underlying ebitda in the table below.
(2)   see "results of operations", "united states segment" under the sub-heading "special items" in this section for additional information. the tax effect related to our share of millercoors special items in 2015 was immaterial and there was no tax effect related to our share of these charges in 2014 or 2013.
(3)   in connection with the pending acquisition, we recognized transaction related fees of $6.9 million within marketing, general and administrative expenses in 2015. additionally, on december 16, 2015 we entered into a bridge loan agreement which provides for a 364-day bridge loan facility of up to $9.3 billion. in connection with the bridge loan, during the year ended december 31, 2015, we paid commitment fees of $49.2 million, which have been deferred within other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2015, and will be amortized to other income (expense) within the consolidated statement of operations over the 364-day term. for the year ended december 31, 2015, $6.9 million was amortized to other expense. further, on december 16, 2015, we also entered into a term loan agreement which provides for a 3-year and 5-year tranche of $1.5 billion for each loan, for an aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion. in connection with the term loan, during the year ended december 31, 2015, we paid issuance fees of $8.3 million, which have been deferred within other assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2015, and will be amortized to interest expense within the consolidated statement of operations over the respective 3-year and 5-year term of each loan. for the year ended december 31, 2015, $0.1 million was amortized to interest expense. see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 12, "debt" of the notes for additional information.
in connection with the our acquisition of starbev holdings s.a.r.l. ("starbev") in 2012 (the "starbev acquisition"), we recognized fees in marketing, general and administrative expenses of $10.7 million in 2013, of which $2.3 million was recorded as depreciation expense in 2013.
(4)   the unrealized changes in fair value on our commodity swaps not designated in hedging relationships are recorded as cost of goods sold within our corporate business activities. as the exposure we are managing is realized, we reclassify the gain or loss to the segment in which the underlying exposure resides, allowing our segments to realize the economic effects of the derivative without the resulting unrealized mark-to-market volatility. related to these derivatives, we recorded unrealized losses of $14.1 million, $4.2 million and $2.7 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
additionally, we issued a €500 million zero coupon senior unsecured convertible note ("convertible note") to starbev l.p. (the "seller") in conjunction with the closing of the starbev acquisition. the convertible note's embedded conversion feature was determined to meet the definition of a derivative required to be bifurcated and separately accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. in 2013, we recognized an unrealized loss of $5.4 million recorded as interest expense related to changes in the fair value of the conversion feature. on august 13, 2013, the seller exercised the conversion feature at an agreed upon value of $14.4 million incremental to the convertible note's principal. upon settlement, $0.8 million was recognized as the realized gain on settlement of the conversion feature, which was initially recorded as a liability of $15.2 million when issued in the second quarter of 2012. additionally, within other income (expense), we recorded unrealized gains of $0.5 million and unrealized losses of $2.4 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to foreign currency movements on this convertible note. we additionally recorded a net loss within other income (expense) of $4.9 million during 2013 related to foreign exchange contracts and cash positions entered into to hedge our risk associated with the payment of this foreign denominated debt. see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 16, "derivative instruments and hedging activities" of the notes for additional information.
(5)   in 2014, we recognized a gain of $11.3 million within marketing, general and administrative expenses related to the release of an indirect tax reserve recorded in conjunction with the initial purchase accounting for the starbev acquisition and is related to the settlement of certain local country regulatory matters associated with pre-acquisition periods.
in 2013, we recognized a net gain of $23.5 million within other income related to the sales of non-core investment assets. see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 5, "other income and expense" of the notes for additional information.
(6)   the effect of taxes on the adjustments used to arrive at underlying net income, a non-gaap measure, is calculated based on applying the underlying full-year effective tax rate to underlying earnings, excluding special and non-core items. the effect of taxes on special and non-core items is calculated based on the statutory tax rate applicable to the item being adjusted for in the jurisdiction from which each adjustment arises. additionally, the adjustment for 2014 includes an income tax benefit of $16.2 million recognized in the first quarter of 2014 related to the release of an
38
income tax reserve recorded in conjunction with the initial purchase accounting for the starbev acquisition and is related to the settlement of certain local country regulatory matters associated with pre-acquisition periods.

cost savings initiatives cost reductions across our company in 2015 exceeded our targets and totaled more than $60 million, driven by our canada and europe segments. millercoors delivered incremental cost savings in 2015 of approximately $88 million, of which our 42% share is approximately $37 million.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was $314.4 million in 2015, a slight increase of $1.4 million compared to 2014, primarily due to increased amortization of our intangible assets as a result of reclassifying certain brands in our europe segment to definite-lived as well as accelerated depreciation related to bottling line and announced brewery closures, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. depreciation and amortization expense was $313.0 million in 2014, a decrease
40
of $7.5 million compared to 2013, primarily due to decreased amortization of our intangible assets, as well as the impact of changes in foreign currency rates.
income taxes our effective tax rate was approximately 13% in 2015, 12% in 2014 and 13% in 2013. our effective tax rates were significantly lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to lower effective income tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses, driven by lower statutory income tax rates and tax planning impacts on statutory taxable income, and favorable resolution of unrecognized tax benefits. the 2015 effective tax rate slightly increased versus 2014 due to a lower amount of unrecognized tax benefits released during 2015, as well as increased valuation allowances against net operating losses recognized in 2015. these increases were partially offset by the tax benefits associated with the renewal application of our bilateral advanced pricing agreement ("bapa") between the u.s. and canada tax authorities, which was formally submitted during the first quarter of 2015. our 2015 underlying effective tax rate, a non-gaap measure, remained consistent with 2014 and 2013. see table below for the reconciliation of our underlying effective tax rate to its nearest u.s. gaap measure.

additionally, our unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $20.3 million in 2015, primarily driven by the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and foreign exchange rate movements. see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 6, "income tax" of the notes for further discussion.

significant events during 2015, we continued our ongoing assessment of our supply chain strategies in order to align with our cost saving objectives. as part of this process, in october 2015, we entered into an agreement to sell the vancouver brewery, with the intent to use the proceeds from the sale to help fund the construction of an efficient and flexible brewery in british columbia. the sale has not yet closed and is anticipated to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2016. in conjunction with the sale, we agreed to lease back the existing property to continue operations on an uninterrupted basis while the new brewery is being constructed. we believe the decision to sell the brewery will help optimize the western canada brewery network and allow for greater flexibility and future cost savings. we incurred accelerated depreciation charges in excess of normal depreciation associated with the planned brewery closure of $1.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2015. we expect to incur additional charges, including estimated accelerated depreciation charges of approximately canadian dollar ("cad") 20 million, through final closure of the brewery which is currently anticipated to occur near the end of 2018. these ongoing charges, along with the estimated future gain on the sale of the property of approximately cad 144 million, will be recorded as special items. we also expect to incur significant capital expenditures associated with the construction of the new brewery, most of which we expect to be funded with the proceeds from the sale of the vancouver brewery.
also as a result of the ongoing strategic review of our canadian supply chain network and the overall shift in consumer preference toward can package consumption in canada, in the third quarter of 2015 we concluded that a bottling line in the vancouver brewery could no longer be utilized, and in the second quarter of 2015 we concluded that a bottling line in our toronto brewery could no longer be utilized. we accordingly recorded charges within special items related to the abandonment of these assets. see below "special items, net" for further details. we will continue to evaluate our supply chain network and seek opportunities for further efficiencies and cost savings, and we therefore may incur additional restructuring related charges in the future.

owners of bri, agreed, in principle and subject to entry into definitive binding documents, to enter into a new beer framework agreement (the "new framework") with the province of ontario. the associated master framework agreement was subsequently executed by all parties on september 22, 2015, and became effective as of january 1, 2016. the new framework is designed to further enhance the overall beer retail and distribution system within ontario, as well as provide easier access to market for small brewers. the new framework includes the implementation of an additional cad 100.0 million annual tax on all beer volume sold in ontario, which will be phased in over four years beginning january 1, 2016. additionally, with the exception of adjustments for increases in annual inflation, we, along with the other largest brewer in ontario, will have restrictions on price increases for certain packaging types of the largest ontario brands until the second quarter of 2017. the new framework is also intended to increase convenience and choice available for consumers by increasing the number and types of outlets where beer is sold (including introducing beer sales to a specified number of grocery stores and standalone outlets), increasing the required level of shelf space allocated to small brewers in retail outlets, as well as allowing for incremental packaging options at the liquor control board of ontario ("lcbo") and agents of the lcbo. the new framework also provides qualifying licensees (restaurants and bars) the ability to purchase beer at bri retail outlets at the same price as retail consumers. further, bri has committed to invest cad 100.0 million of capital spending through 2018, 80% of which will be directed toward enhancements to the purchasing experience for consumers. the new framework also incorporates many of the proposed changes to the bri ownership structure that were announced in january 2015, allowing all other ontario brewers, regardless of size, to participate in the ownership and governance of bri (see note 4, "investments"). we continue to evaluate and are beginning to implement actions to mitigate any adverse impacts to our canada segment that may result from the adoption of the new framework. additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we became aware of a legal dispute related to bri which could result in an adverse impact to our future results. see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 18, "commitments and contingencies" of the notes for further discussion.
in the fourth quarter of 2014, we entered into an agreement with miller brewing company ("miller") for the accelerated termination of our license agreement, effective march 2015, under which we had exclusive rights to distribute certain miller products in canada. as a result, beginning in the second quarter of 2015 we no longer distribute the miller brands in canada, which has adversely impacted our volume and sales prospectively. we recognized net sales related to the license agreement of $11.5 million, $79.5 million and, $92.3 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
further, we finalized the termination of our mmi joint venture relationship in the first quarter of 2014. as such, our results for the year ended december 31, 2014, include our percentage share of the mmi results through the transition period ended february 28, 2014. see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 4, "investments" and note 11, "goodwill and intangible assets" of the notes for further discussion of these matters impacting our canada business.
foreign currency impact on results during 2015, the canadian dollar ("cad") depreciated versus the usd on an average basis, resulting in a decrease of $34.3 million and $39.3 million to our 2015 usd earnings before income taxes and usd underlying pretax income, respectively. during 2014, the cad depreciated against the usd on an average basis, resulting in a decrease of $22.9 million and $18.0 million to our 2014 usd earnings before income taxes and usd underlying pretax income, respectively. included in these amounts are both translational and transactional impacts of changes in foreign exchange rates. the impact of transaction gains and losses is recorded within other income (expense).
volume and net sales strs decreased 6.0% in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by the impact of the loss of the miller brand agreement, a weak economy and increased competitor promotional activity. canadian beer industry strs increased slightly in 2015 compared to 2014; however, our market share declined on a full-year basis. sales volume decreased in 2015 compared to 2014, due to the termination of the miller brand agreement and increased competitive pressure on our core brands. net sales per hectoliter increased 2.5% in local currency in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by favorable pricing.
strs decreased 4.7% in 2014 compared to 2013, driven by the termination of the mmi joint venture, decline in the overall industry, weak economic factors, increased competitor promotional activity and unfavorable weather across key regions in 2014. the canadian beer industry strs decreased in 2014 compared to calendar year 2013. our market share also declined on a full-year basis. sales volume decreased in 2014 compared to 2013, due to continued industry softness and increased competitive pressure on our core brands. net sales per hectoliter increased 1.8% in local currency in 2014 compared to 2013, driven by favorable pricing and mix shift to higher priced brands and packages.
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 2.5% in local currency in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by input inflation, negative foreign currency impacts, fixed-cost deleverage and sales mix shift toward higher-cost brands and packages. these factors were partially offset by cost savings.
43
cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 2.3% in local currency in 2014 compared to 2013, driven by input inflation and fixed-cost deleverage, the termination of the modelo joint venture, sales mix shift toward higher-cost brands and packages, and increased promotional packaging expense. these factors were partially offset by cost savings. under the mmi arrangement, we recognized equity earnings within cost of goods sold of $0.7 million and $11.7 million during the years ended 2014 and 2013, respectively.
marketing, general and administrative expenses marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased slightly in local currency in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by cost savings, partially offset by higher marketing spending.
marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased 1.4% in local currency in 2014 compared to 2013, driven by cost savings, partially offset by higher marketing spending and incentive compensation, as well as cycling administrative cost recoveries from mmi. during the years ended 2014 and 2013, mcc recognized administrative cost recoveries under our agency and services agreement with mmi of $0.7 million and $6.8 million, respectively. marketing spend and related recoveries under this agreement had zero impact on our results for all periods presented.
special items, net during 2015, we incurred $15.7 million of charges related to the closure of a bottling line within our vancouver brewery, including $15.4 million of accelerated depreciation associated with this bottling line. additionally, we incurred $8.2 million of charges related to the closure of a bottling line within our toronto brewery, including $7.9 million of accelerated depreciation associated with this bottling line. the decisions to close these bottling lines were made as part of an ongoing strategic review of our canadian supply chain network and the overall shift in consumer preference toward can package consumption in canada. separately, we recorded $1.2 million of accelerated depreciation in excess of normal depreciation associated with the planned closure of the vancouver brewery. results also include special charges related to restructuring activities of $2.1 million incurred during 2015.
during the third quarter of 2014 and fourth quarter of 2013, we recognized impairment charges related to our definite-lived intangible asset associated with our license agreement with miller in canada. see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 11, "goodwill and intangible assets" of the notes for further discussion.
during the first quarter of 2014, we finalized the termination of our mmi joint venture and concurrently recognized a charge of $4.9 million for the accelerated amortization of the remaining carrying value of our definite-lived intangible asset associated with the agreement, as well as recorded income of $63.2 million for the payment received upon termination. see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 4, "investments" of the notes for further discussion.

the discussion below highlights the millercoors results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2015, versus the year ended december 31, 2014, and for the year ended december 31, 2014, versus the year ended december 31, 2013.
significant events during the third quarter of 2015, millercoors announced plans to close its brewery in eden, north carolina, in an effort to optimize the brewery footprint and streamline operations for greater efficiency. products currently produced in eden will be transitioned to other breweries in the millercoors network, and the eden brewery is anticipated to be closed in september 2016. as a result of the announcement of the planned brewery closure, millercoors recognized $67.7 million of charges during the second half of 2015 as special items, of which $61.3 million related to accelerated depreciation of brewery assets. millercoors will continue to incur special charges during each reporting period through the planned closure of the brewery in september 2016. total special charges associated with the planned eden closure are expected to be approximately $150 million to $200 million, consisting primarily of accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs. however, this estimated range contains significant uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainty regarding the ultimate net cost associated with the disposition of assets, restructuring charges, contract termination costs, and other costs associated with the planned closure. additionally, during the third quarter of 2015, millercoors announced the acquisition of saint archer brewing company, a craft brewery, which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2015.
volume and net sales domestic strs declined 2.6% in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by declines in both the economy and premium light portfolios, partially offset by growth in redd's, blue moon, leinenkugel's and coors banquet.

significant events during 2015, we continued our ongoing assessment of our european supply chain strategies in order to align with our cost saving objectives. as part of this continued strategic review of our european supply chain network, in the fourth quarter of 2015, management announced that we entered into a consultation process regarding our proposal to close of our burton south brewery in the u.k. to consolidate production within our recently modernized burton north brewery. additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we closed our plovdiv brewery in bulgaria. these announcements follow the closure of the alton brewery in the u.k., which was completed during the second quarter of 2015. as a result of these closures, we incurred charges which were recorded within special items, including accelerated depreciation, and expect to incur additional charges as discussed further below. we will continue to evaluate our supply chain network and seek opportunities for further efficiencies and cost savings, and we therefore may incur additional restructuring related charges in the future related to these activities.
in the third quarter of 2015, we purchased the rekorderlig cider brand distribution rights in the u.k. and ireland and also sold our u.k. malting facility. in the second quarter of 2015, we terminated our distribution agreement with carlsberg whereby it held the exclusive distribution rights for the staropramen brand in the u.k., which gave us the exclusive distribution rights for the staropramen brand in the u.k. at the end of 2015. we believe these transactions will play a key role in transforming our portfolio, give us high-potential to grow our business in key markets and mitigate the impact of contract losses related to the
48
distribution of the modelo brands in the u.k. which expired as of december 31, 2014, and the termination of our contract brewing arrangement with heineken in the u.k. which became effective at the end of april 2015.
additionally, during the first quarter of 2015 and fourth quarter of 2014, we received assessments from a local country regulatory authority in europe. while we intend to vigorously challenge the validity of the assessments and defend our position, if the assessments, as issued, are ultimately upheld, they could materially affect our results of operations. see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 18, "commitments and contingencies" of the notes for further discussion.
further, in 2015, 2014 and 2013 we recorded impairment charges for certain indefinite-lived intangible brands primarily driven by continued macroeconomic challenges, and have reclassified these brands to definite-lived. see "special items, net" below for more details.
foreign currency impact on results our europe segment operates in numerous countries within europe, and each country's operations utilize distinct currencies. during 2015, foreign currency movements increased our europe usd loss from continuing operations before income taxes by $24.0 million, and reduced usd underlying pretax income by $25.4 million. during 2014, foreign currency movements reduced our europe usd loss from continuing operations before income taxes by $8.8 million, and increased usd underlying pretax income by $7.7 million. included in these amounts are both translational and transactional impacts of changes in foreign exchange rates. the impact of transactional gains and losses is recorded within other income (expense).
volume and net sales sales volume decreased slightly in 2015 compared to 2014, due to the loss of the modelo brands in the u.k. in 2015, offset by strong growth in romania and croatia.
net sales per hectoliter decreased 2.0% in local currency in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the loss of contract brewing revenue and the modelo brands in the u.k.
sales volume decreased slightly in 2014 compared to 2013, due to weak consumer demand, as well as the impacts of significant flooding in the balkans region in the second quarter of 2014. these factors were partially offset by improved performance in hungary, romania, czech republic and the u.k.
net sales per hectoliter increased 1.0% in local currency in 2014 compared to 2013, due to positive mix.
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold per hectoliter decreased 2.9% in local currency in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by the elimination of modelo brand costs and lower contract brewing volume in the u.k., along with positive supply chain performance.
cost of goods sold per hectoliter decreased 1.1% in local currency in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily driven by lower supply chain and distribution costs offsetting negative mix impact.
marketing, general and administrative expenses marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 2.8% in local currency in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by the release of a regulatory reserve in the third quarter of 2014 and an $11.3 million non-core gain recognized in the first quarter of 2014 related to the favorable resolution of an indirect-tax audit, along with severance costs and higher brand amortization expense in 2015.
marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased 1.4% in local currency in 2014 compared to 2013, driven by cost savings, the release of a regulatory reserve in the third quarter of 2014 and a non-core gain related to the favorable resolution of an indirect-tax reserve during the fourth quarter 2014, partially offset by higher investment behind core brands and innovation.
special items, net during the third quarter of 2015, we identified impairment indicators as it pertains to indefinite-lived intangible assets related to certain european brands driven by key changes to our underlying assumptions supporting the value of the brands. specific changes include underperformance through the 2015 peak season driving a downward shift in management's forecasts, along with challenging macroeconomic and competitive conditions that we no longer expect to subside in the near term. as a result, we recorded an aggregate impairment charge of $275.0 million within special items in the third quarter of 2015 and
49
reclassified the brands to definite-lived intangible assets. this followed impairment charges of indefinite-lived brand assets of $360.0 million and $150.9 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 11, "goodwill and intangible assets" of the notes for further discussion.
as part of our continued strategic review of our european supply chain network, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into a consultation process regarding the proposal to close our burton south brewery in the u.k. to consolidate production within our recently modernized burton north brewery. as a result, we incurred accelerated depreciation charges related to the announced proposed burton south brewery closure in excess of our normal depreciation associated with this brewery of $1.4 million. we expect to incur future accelerated depreciation in excess of our normal depreciation of approximately gbp 9 million related to the burton south brewery from the first quarter of 2016 through the third quarter of 2017. also, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we closed our plovdiv brewery in bulgaria resulting in $2.1 million of asset abandonment related special charges, including accelerated depreciation in excess of our normal depreciation of $1.0 million as it pertains to this brewery.
additionally, as part of this review, during the second quarter of 2015, we completed the closure of the alton brewery in the u.k. which closing process began in the fourth quarter for 2014. as a result, in 2015 we incurred asset abandonment related special charges associated with this closure of $24.0 million, including accelerated depreciation in excess of our normal depreciation associated with this brewery of $21.8 million. in 2014, we incurred accelerated depreciation in excess of our normal depreciation associated with this brewery of $4.0 million.
we do not expect to incur future accelerated depreciation on the alton and plovdiv breweries. we may recognize other asset-related charges or benefits related to these breweries, which cannot currently be estimated and will be recorded within special items. see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 7, "special items" of the notes for further discussion.

(1)   see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 7, "special items" of the notes for detail of special items.
marketing, general and administrative expenses marketing, general and administrative expenses increased in 2015 compared to 2014, due to costs incurred in 2015 associated with the pending acquisition of millercoors.
marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased slightly in 2014 compared to 2013, due to starbev acquisition and related integration costs recognized in 2013.
interest expense, net net interest expense decreased 2015 compared to 2014, driven primarily by lower interest expense recorded on our $300 million 2.0% notes due 2017 ("$300 million notes") and our $500 million 3.5% notes due 2022 ("$500 million notes") as a result of our interest rate swap hedges on these notes.
net interest expense decreased 2014 compared to 2013, driven by our ongoing efforts focused on deleveraging over the last year, which resulted in lower interest incurred on our outstanding borrowings, as well as an additional loss of $5.4 million included in 2013, related to the change in fair value on the conversion feature associated with the €500 million convertible note.
other income (expense), net the impact of transactional gains and losses is recorded within other income (expense). other income includes $6.9 million of amortization expense related to commitment fees on the bridge loan for the year ended december 31, 2015.
52
additionally, other income includes gains of $3.3 million and $22.3 million in 2015 and 2013, respectively, resulting from the sale of non-operating assets.
see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 5, "other income and expense" of the notes for further discussion of other income (expense) amounts.
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity include cash provided by operating activities, access to external borrowings and monetization of assets. we believe that cash flows from operations, including distributions from millercoors, and cash provided by short-term and long-term borrowings, when necessary, will be more than adequate to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments and capital expenditures for the next twelve months, and our long-term liquidity requirements. we expect to issue additional long-term debt to fund a portion of the $12.0 billion pending acquisition, as well as the related transaction costs. see below for additional information on the pending acquisition. a significant portion of our trade receivables are concentrated in europe. while these receivables are not concentrated with any specific customer and our allowance on these receivables factors in collectibility, our ability to collect may be impacted by any further economic downturn within europe.
a significant portion of our cash flows from operating activities is generated outside the u.s., in currencies other than usd. as of december 31, 2015, approximately 66% of our cash and cash equivalents were located outside the u.s., largely denominated in foreign currencies. most of the amounts held outside of the u.s. could be repatriated to the u.s., but under current law, would be subject to u.s. federal and state income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. we accrue for u.s. federal and state tax consequences on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries upon repatriation. when the earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the u.s., we do not accrue u.s. federal and state tax consequences. we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. we periodically review and evaluate these strategies, including external committed and non-committed credit agreements accessible by mcbc and each of our operating subsidiaries. these financing arrangements, along with the distributions received from millercoors, are sufficient to fund our current cash needs in the u.s.
net working capital as of december 31, 2015, and december 31, 2014, we had debt-free net working capital of positive $70.3 million and positive $101.2 million, respectively. short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt are excluded from net working capital as they are not reflective of the ongoing operational requirements of the business. the levels of working capital required to run our business fluctuate with the seasonality in our business. our working capital is also sensitive to foreign exchange rates, as a significant majority of current assets and current liabilities are denominated in either cad or our european operating currencies such as, but not limited to, gbp, euro, czech koruna, croatian kuna, serbian dinar, new romanian leu, bulgarian lev and hungarian forint, while financial results are reported in usd. below is a table outlining our current and historical net working capital levels:

(1)   amounts have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of the authoritative guidance requiring debt issuance costs to be presented as a direct reduction from the carrying value of the related debt. see note 2, "new accounting pronouncements" for further discussion. separately, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we prospectively adopted authoritative guidance requiring all deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities to be presented as non-current on the consolidated balance sheet. as a result, all current deferred tax assets and liabilities were reclassified to non-current in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2015. because we adopted this guidance prospectively, the prior period balances have not been retrospectively adjusted and continue to reflect current and non-current classification as historically presented. as such, comparability issues are present within the current and prior year balances in the table above. see part ii-item 8 financial statements, note 6, "income tax" of the notes for further details.
53
the decrease in net working capital from $101.2 million at december 31, 2014, to $70.3 million at december 31, 2015, is primarily related to an overall decrease in cash balances due to additional cash used in the current year to pay our discretionary cash contribution of $227.1 million made to our u.k. pension plan, to repurchase shares of our class b common stock, and to acquire mount shivalik in india and the rekorderlig distribution rights in the u.k., as well as a decrease in our payables balance, partially offset by lower cash repayments on our commercial paper program during 2015. see additional discussion below under subheading "cash and cash equivalents" and part ii-item 8 financial statements, note 12, "debt" of the notes for further details of the current portion of long-term debt and short-term borrowings.
cash flows our business generates positive operating cash flows each year, and our debt maturities are of a longer-term nature. however, our liquidity could be impacted significantly by the risk factors described in part i, item 1a. risk factors.
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities of $696.4 million in 2015, decreased by $576.2 million compared to 2014. this decrease was primarily due to lower net income, adjusted for lower non-cash add-backs, along with unfavorable foreign currency movements, higher cash paid for pension contributions, including our $227.1 million discretionary payment to our u.k. pension plan, and taxes.
net cash provided by operating activities of $1,272.6 million in 2014 increased by $104.4 million compared to 2013. this increase was primarily due to higher net income, adjusted for increased non-cash add-backs, along with lower cash paid for pension contributions, interest, taxes and restructuring.
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities of $334.7 million in 2015, increased by $95.3 million compared to 2014 driven primarily by the cash paid in 2015 for the acquisition of mount shivalik in india and the rekorderlig distribution rights in the u.k.
net cash used in investing activities of $239.4 million in 2014, decreased by $37.6 million compared to 2013.
•   this decrease was primarily driven by lower net investments in millercoors, lower capital expenditures and higher return of capital from unconsolidated affiliates.
•   further, proceeds from sales of properties and other assets decreased by $44.8 million primarily due to the sale of our interest in our tradeteam joint venture to dhl as well as the sale of other non-core investment assets in 2013. see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 4, "investments" and note 5, "other income and expense" of the notes for further discussion.
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities of $512.0 million in 2015, decreased by $290.0 million compared to 2014.
•   this decrease is primarily driven by proceeds on our commercial paper program and other revolving credit facilities in 2015 compared to repayments in 2014. specifically, we had proceeds of $3.9 million in 2015 versus repayments of $513.9 million in 2014.
•   this decrease is partially offset by our class b common stock share repurchase of approximately $150 million in 2015 as well as increased repayments on our overdraft facilities, payments for debt issuance costs and dividend payments during 2015.
net cash used in financing activities of $802.0 million in 2014, decreased by $257.2 million compared to 2013.
•   the decrease in cash used in financing activities is primarily related to additional 2013 payments of long-term debt partially offset by additional 2014 net payments on revolving credit facilities and commercial paper. during 2013 we repaid the $575 million convertible bonds, the €500 million convertible note (less the €44.9 million initially withheld) for $614.7 million, and the balance of our euro denominated term loan for $123.8 million.
comparatively, during 2014, we released $61.4 million (€44.9 million) of the €500 million convertible note to the seller. additionally during 2014, we made net payments of $513.9 million on our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program compared to proceeds of $507.4 million in 2013. these payments in the current year were primarily driven by reducing the outstanding balances on our commercial paper borrowings and euro-denominated revolving credit facility to zero. additionally, we had net borrowings on
54
our european notional cross-border, cross currency cash pool within our europe business of $74.1 million for 2014. comparatively, we were not in an overdraft position as of december 31, 2013, or as of december 29, 2012, and thus the net overdraft borrowings was zero in 2013.
•   during 2014 we repaid $65.2 million on our remaining cross currency swaps, which were extended and designated as a net investment hedge in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $119.4 million in 2013.
•   the decrease in cash used in financing activities during 2014, was also offset by a $43.9 million decrease in the proceeds from exercise of stock options, including the related tax impact, as well as a $39.0 million increase in dividends paid.
see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 12, "debt" of the notes for a summary of our financing activities and debt position at december 31, 2015, and december 31, 2014.
underlying free cash flow we generated $704.3 million of underlying free cash flow in 2015. this represents a 26.4% decrease in underlying free cash flow compared to $956.7 million in 2014, primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency movements, lower underlying net income, after considering non-cash adjustments, lower net distributions from millercoors, higher capital expenditures and higher cash paid for taxes, partially offset by favorable impact from working capital changes.

pending acquisition the pending acquisition is expected to be funded through cash on hand and financed through a combination of incremental debt and equity. specifically, in connection with the pending acquisition, we entered into a bridge loan agreement which provides for a 364-day bridge loan facility of up to $9.3 billion. in connection with the bridge loan, during the year ended december 31, 2015, we paid commitment fees of $49.2 million. additionally, on december 16, 2015, we also entered into a term loan agreement by and among us the lenders party thereto, and citibank, n.a., as administrative agent. the term loan agreement provides for total term loan commitments of $1.5 billion in a 3-year tranche and $1.5 billion in a 5-year tranche, for an aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion. in connection with the term loan, during the year ended december 31, 2015, we paid issuance fees of $8.3 million. as of december 31, 2015, there are no borrowings on the bridge loan or term loan. we do not expect to draw on the bridge loan and we do not expect to have borrowings on the term loan until or near the completion of the pending acquisition. on february 3, 2016, we received proceeds of $2.5 billion, net of issuance and other fees from our january 26, 2016, equity offering of 29.9 million shares of our class b common stock, inclusive of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, which reduced the commitment on our bridge loan to $6.8 billion, representing the amount mcbc expects to replace with permanent long-term financing between now and the consummation of the pending acquisition. related to this expected long-term financing, we entered into swaptions in january 2016 with a total notional of $855.0 million to hedge a portion of our anticipated long-term debt issuance. we intend to terminate and settle these swaptions upon maturity or immediately prior to the completion of the associated pending debt issuance in the event that occurs prior to maturity. additionally, in order to maximize the yield on the cash received from the equity issuance, while maintaining liquidity, mcbc has strategically invested the proceeds in various fixed rate deposit and money market accounts with terms of three months or less.
at this time, we anticipate this acquisition will close in the second half of 2016, subject to necessary regulatory approvals and contingent on the successful closing of the abi/sabmiller transaction.
capital resources cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2015, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $430.9 million, compared to $624.6 million at december 31, 2014. the decrease in cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2015, from december 31, 2014, was primarily driven by our discretionary cash contribution of $227.1 million made to our u.k. pension plan in the first quarter of 2015 as well as our share repurchases of approximately $150 million. our cash and cash equivalents are invested in a variety of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. these investments are viewed by management as low-risk investments and on which there are little to no restrictions regarding our ability to access the underlying cash to fund our operations as necessary. we also utilize a cash pooling arrangement to facilitate the access to cash.
borrowings the majority of our outstanding borrowings as of december 31, 2015, consisted of fixed-rate senior notes, with maturities ranging from 2017 to 2042. the cad 900 million 5.0% notes due 2015 were repaid during the third quarter of 2015 using the proceeds from the issuance of the cad 500 million 2.75% notes due 2020 and cad 400 million 2.25% notes due 2018, which were both issued in september 2015 (collectively the "2015 notes"). beginning in the second quarter of 2014, we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to the volatility of the interest rates associated with future interest payments on the forecasted debt issuance. under the agreements, we were required to early terminate these swaps at the approximate time we issued the previously forecasted debt. at the time of issuance of the 2015 notes, the government of canada bond rates were trading at a yield lower than that locked in by the interest rate swaps, resulting in an aggregate loss of cad 39.2 million ($29.5 million at settlement), which was recorded in other comprehensive income. during 2014, we also entered into interest rate swaps to economically convert our fixed rate $500 million 3.5% notes due 2022 to floating rate debt. additionally, in the first quarter of 2015, we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and a cross currency swap with a notional amount of eur 265 million ($300 million upon execution) to economically convert our fixed rate $300 million 2.0% notes due in 2017 to floating rate, euro denominated debt. during the fourth quarter of 2015, we voluntarily cash settled all of our interest rate swaps which resulted in cash receipts of $18.8 million as well as our cross currency swap which resulted in cash receipts of $16.0 million. we also hold short-term borrowings primarily related to overdrafts on our cross-border cash pool arrangement and revolving credit facilities. see part ii-item 8 financial statements, note 12, "debt" of the notes for further details.
based on the credit profile of our lenders that are party to our credit facilities, we are confident in our ability to draw on such credit facilities if the need arises. there were no outstanding borrowings under our $750 million revolving credit facility or under our commercial paper program as of december 31, 2015, and thus we had $750 million available to draw on under this revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2015, as the borrowing capacity is reduced by borrowings under our
56
commercial paper program. we also have japanese yen ("jpy") and euro ("eur") uncommitted lines of credit, and cad and british pound ("gbp") overdraft facilities with several banks should we need additional short-term liquidity.
under the terms of each of our debt facilities, we must comply with certain restrictions. these include restrictions on priority indebtedness (certain threshold percentages of secured consolidated net tangible assets), leverage thresholds, liens, and restrictions on certain types of sale lease-back transactions. the covenants specify that our leverage ratio cannot exceed 3.5x debt to ebitda, as defined in our credit agreement. as of december 31, 2015, and december 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all of these restrictions and have met all debt payment obligations. as part of the pending acquisition, we have amended our $750 million revolving multi-currency credit facility due in 2019 to increase the maximum leverage ratio to 5.75x debt to ebitda effective following the completion of the acquisition, with a decline to 3.75x debt to ebitda in the fourth year following the closing of transaction.
see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 12, "debt" of the notes for a complete discussion and presentation of all borrowings and available sources of borrowing, including lines of credit.
use of cash during 2015, we made contributions to our defined benefit pension plans of $256.1 million, which includes our discretionary cash contribution of $227.1 million made to our u.k. pension plan.
on february 10, 2015, we announced that our board of directors approved and authorized a new program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our class a and class b common stock. during 2015, we purchased a total of approximately 2 million shares of our class b common stock under the new program for approximately $150 million. as a result of the pending acquisition, we have suspended the share repurchase program. as we pay down debt we will revisit our share repurchase program once deleveraging is well underway.
during 2015, we paid quarterly dividends of $0.41 per share, totaling $303.4 million payments during 2015. as a result of the pending acquisition, we plan to maintain our current quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share as we pay down debt, and we will revisit our dividend policy once deleveraging is well underway.
credit rating our current long-term credit ratings are bbb-/stable outlook, baa2/negative outlook, bbb/negative outlook and bbb/negative outlook with standard and poor's, moody's investor services, fitch ratings and dbrs, respectively. similarly, our short-term credit ratings are a-2, prime-2, f2 and r-2, respectively. a securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and it may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency.
foreign exchange foreign exchange risk is inherent in our operations primarily due to the significant operating results that are denominated in currencies other than usd. our approach is to reduce the volatility of cash flows and reported earnings which result from currency fluctuations rather than business related factors. therefore, we closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to foreign currency fluctuations. our financial risk management policy is intended to offset a portion of the potentially unfavorable impact of exchange rate changes on net income and earnings per share. see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 16, "derivative instruments and hedging activities" of the notes for additional information on our financial risk management strategies.
our consolidated financial statements are presented in usd, which is our reporting currency. assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies that are the functional currencies for the respective operations are translated at the prevailing exchange rate at the balance sheet date. translation adjustments resulting from this process are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income. revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period. gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in earnings for the period. the significant exchange rates to the usd used in the preparation of our consolidated financial results for the primary foreign currencies used in our foreign operations (functional currency) are as follows:

the exchange rates for the years ended december 31, 2015, december 31, 2014, and december 31, 2013, have been calculated based on the average of the foreign exchange rates during the relevant period and have been weighted according to the foreign denominated earnings before interest and taxes of the usd equivalent.
foreign currencies in the countries in which we operate, specifically the cad, eur, gbp, czk, hrk and rsd, devalued significantly over the last year which had a significant impact on our 2015 usd reported earnings. if these rates continue to devalue in 2016, then the impact on usd reported earnings may be material.
capital expenditures in 2015, we incurred $269.1 million, and paid $275.0 million, on capital improvement projects worldwide, which excludes capital spending by millercoors and other equity method joint ventures, representing an approximate 8% decrease versus 2014 capital expenditures incurred of $291.3 million, primarily driven by the strengthening of the usd in 2015 compared to 2014. we expect to incur capital expenditures in 2016 of approximately $300 million, based on foreign exchange rates as of december 31, 2015, excluding millercoors and other equity method joint ventures or consideration of the potential implications of the pending acquisition. the increase in planned expenditures for 2016 from 2015 is primarily due to planned supply chain capital projects in canada, including the costs of construction of an efficient and flexible brewery in british columbia following the sale of our vancouver brewery in early 2016, the proceeds from which will help fund the new brewery construction.
we have increased our focus on where and how we employ our planned capital expenditures, specifically strengthening our focus on required returns on invested capital as we determine how to best allocate cash within the business.

see part ii - item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 12, "debt", note 15, "employee retirement plans and postretirement benefits", note 16, "derivative instruments and hedging activities" and note 18, "commitments and contingencies" of the notes for additional information.
(1)   represents expected contributions under our defined benefit pension plans in the next twelve months and our benefit payments under postretirement benefit plans for all periods presented. the net underfunded liability at december 31, 2015, of our defined benefit pension plans (excluding our overfunded plans) and postretirement benefit plans is $74.0 million and $136.1 million, respectively. defined benefit pension plan contributions in future years will vary based on a number of factors, including actual plan asset returns and interest rates, and as such, have been excluded from the above table. we fund pension plans to meet the requirements set forth in applicable employee benefits laws. we may also voluntarily increase funding levels to meet financial goals. pension contributions and postretirement benefit payments on a consolidated basis (excluding millercoors, bri and bdl) were $262.2 million in 2015. excluding millercoors, bri and bdl, we expect to make contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2016 up to approximately $20 million and benefit payments for our other postretirement benefit plans of approximately $10 million in 2016.
our u.k. pension plan is subject to a statutory valuation for funding purposes every three years. the most recent valuation as of june 30, 2013, was completed during the first quarter of 2014 and resulted in a long-term funding commitment plan consisting of an mcbc guarantee of a gbp 150 million lump-sum contribution ($227.1 million at payment date) which was paid in january 2015, and annual contributions of gbp 24 million to be made from january 2017 through december 2026, which are excluded from the table above.
we have taken numerous steps in recent years to reduce our exposure to these long-term pension obligations, including the closure of the u.k. pension plan in early 2009 to future earning of service credit and benefit modifications in several of our canada plans. however, given the net liability of these plans and their dependence upon the global financial markets for their financial health, the plans may continue to periodically require potentially significant amounts of cash funding.
(2)   the "other long-term obligations" line primarily includes non-cancellable purchase commitments as of december 31, 2015, that are enforceable and legally binding. approximately $1,233 million of the total other long-term obligations relate to long-term supply contracts with third parties to purchase raw material, packaging material and energy used in production. approximately $962 million relates to commitments associated with tradeteam in the u.k. our aggregate commitments for advertising and promotions, including sports sponsorship, total approximately $406 million. the remaining amounts relate to derivative payments, sales and marketing, distribution, information technology services, open purchase orders and other commitments. included in other long-term obligations are $8.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding positions we would expect to settle using deferred tax assets, and $10.3 million of indemnities provided to femsa for which we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows, and we have therefore included these amounts in the more than 5 years column.

contingencies we are party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, environmental litigation and indemnities associated with our sale of kaiser to femsa. additionally, during the first quarter of 2015 and fourth quarter of 2014, we received assessments from a local country regulatory authority related to our europe operations. while we intend to vigorously challenge the validity of the assessment and defend our position, if the assessments, as issued, are ultimately upheld, they could materially affect our results of operations. see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 18, "commitments and contingencies" of the notes for further discussion.
off-balance sheet arrangements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, our operating leases are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. see part ii-item 8 financial statements, note 18, "commitments and contingencies" of the notes for further discussion of these off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of regulation s-k). as of december 31, 2015, we did not have any other material off-balance sheet arrangements.
outlook for 2016
in 2016, we will continue our relentless focus on delighting our consumers and our customers to ensure we are the first choice brewer in the geographies and segments in which we operate. we will also continue to drive our strategy of building a stronger brand portfolio that is delivering value-added innovation, strengthening our core brand positions and increasing our share in above premium, flavored malt beverages, craft and cider. we will do this while ensuring that we have a meaningful cost base and a deeply embedded focus on our approach to generating higher returns for our invested capital, managing our working capital and delivering a greater return on investment for our shareholders.
in canada, we recently launched our newest chapter on our molson canadian "anything for hockey" campaign generating 80 million media impressions in the first week. for coors light we expect to significantly increase programming and further evolve our communications with a new campaign building on learnings from 2015. in above premium, consumer demand remains strong for coors banquet, belgian moon, molson canadian cider, and mad jack lager. building on that momentum, we will continue to introduce new variants on the successful and rapidly growing mad jack brand and also our ciders, which have been exceeding growth expectations. finally, in addition to heineken, strongbow and heineken's other top-end import brands, such as dos equis and sol, we picked up the distribution of all heineken trading brands in canada at the start of the new year. in 2016, we will also continue to restructure our business to ensure we are fit for the future, including the sale of our vancouver brewery, which will allow us to build a more efficient and flexible brewery over the next few years.
we expect our 2016 canada cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase at a low-single-digit rate in local currency.
in the u.s., millercoors began to drive substantial changes to the business in the latter half of 2015 that were necessary to create the foundation for volume growth we aim to achieve by 2019. in american light lagers, the revitalization of our two largest brands is progressing well, and we are seeing segment share growth in both coors light and miller lite for the first time since millercoors was formed nearly 8 years ago. in above premium, millercoors continue to focus on higher-margin offerings that can scale and stick, including further extensions from leinenkugel's and blue moon. in hard cider, millercoors is continuing to broaden the appeal of smith & forge hard cider by adding a bottle package to our line-up. in early january, to strengthen our flavored malt beverage portfolio, we launched henry's hard soda, which has been met with great enthusiasm from our distributors and retail partners. millercoors is also continuing to develop new strategies to improve the performance
60
of our economy brands, which have presented challenges on our volume trends. millercoors will continue to build first choice customer partnerships, working with our distributors to bring more resources to the on-premise with our building with beer retail strategy, which leverages the higher velocity and broad appeal of american light lagers.
we expect millercoors cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase at a low-single-digit rate in 2016.
in europe, the terminated heineken contract in the u.k. will continue to present a headwind in the first quarter of 2016, as will the new amortization expense for the brands that we impaired and moved to definite lived during the third quarter of 2015. we will continue to invest in our core brand portfolio across europe to grow share of segment. we also intend to continue to invest in our above premium portfolio. starting in 2016, we expect rekorderlig cider and staropramen in the u.k. and republic of ireland to contribute with more than 350,000 hectoliters of above premium volume annually to our europe business and to provide attractive growth potential for the future. in combination with the integration of the franciscan well craft brands in republic of ireland and the acquisition of the brewing and kegging operation of thomas hardy's burtonwood brewery in england, we now have a broad range of consumer and customer offerings in the above premium, craft and cider segments across the u.k. and republic of ireland. additionally, we are implementing significant new initiatives to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our european operations and to provide more resources to invest in driving top-line and bottom-line growth. as the two most recent examples, we closed one of our breweries in bulgaria in november 2015, and we have entered into a consultation process in the u.k. regarding our proposal to close our burton south brewery and consolidate production within our recently modernized burton north brewery by the end of 2017.
we expect our 2016 europe cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase at a low-single-digit rate versus 2015 in local currency.
mci is focused on attaining profitability in 2016 on a constant-currency basis versus 2013, when we made this commitment, and continuing to accelerate our overall growth and expansion in new and existing markets. upon closing on the pending acquisition, we are planning to integrate the miller brands into our international portfolio and leverage a footprint that complements our growth strategy and allows us to gain entrance into high-priority markets, while increasing our business scale in current markets. we will also continue to drive rapid growth for coors light in latin america, including the high-potential colombia market, where we launched in the fourth quarter of 2015. in the future, we expect coors, miller and staropramen to form the foundation of our international brand portfolio.
we expect our 2016 mci cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase at a low-single-digit rate in local currency.
we expect 2016 marketing, general and administrative expense in corporate to be approximately $120 million.
we currently anticipate up to approximately $20 million of cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2016 and pension expense of approximately $8 million, based on foreign exchange rates as of december 31, 2015. millercoors, bri and bdl pension expense and contributions to their respective defined benefit pension plans are excluded here, as they are not consolidated in our financial statements.
pending acquisition the most important strategic development of 2015, which we expect to significantly advance our ambition to be the first choice for consumers and customers, is our definitive agreement to purchase the remaining 58% of sabmiller's economic interest and 50% voting interest in millercoors as well as all trademarks, contracts and other assets primarily related to the miller brand portfolio outside of the u.s. and puerto rico. we anticipate the pending acquisition to close in the second half of 2016, subject to necessary regulatory approvals and contingent on the successful closing of the abi/sabmiller transaction. we expect to replace the outstanding commitment on our bridge loan with long-term financing to partially fund the pending acquisition. we expect to incur increased general and administrative expenses, as well as non-operating expenses as a result of the pending acquisition including transactional costs, current temporary financing costs, as well as costs associated with our anticipated long-term financing.
interest we anticipate 2016 consolidated net interest expense of approximately $110 million, excluding interest related to the pending acquisition, based on foreign exchange rates as of december 31, 2015.
tax our tax rate is volatile and may move up or down with changes in, among other things, the amount and source of income or loss, our ability to utilize foreign tax credits, changes in tax laws, and the movement of liabilities established pursuant to accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions as statutes of limitations expire, positions are effectively settled or when additional information becomes available. excluding any effects of the pending acquisition, we expect our 2016 underlying
61
effective tax rate to be in the range of 18% to 22%. after 2016, we expect our underlying effective tax rate to be near the low end of our long term range of 20% to 24%, assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits, adjustments to our uncertain tax positions, or significant acquisitions or divestitures. there are proposed or pending tax law changes in various jurisdictions in which we do business that, if enacted, may have an impact on our underlying effective tax rate. additionally, the completion of the pending acquisition is expected to increase our effective tax rate if consummated.
dividends as a result of the pending acquisition, we plan to maintain our current quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share as we pay down debt, and we will revisit our dividend policy once deleveraging is well underway.
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make judgments and estimates that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. our estimates are based on historical experience, current trends and various other assumptions we believe to be relevant under the circumstances. we review the underlying factors used in our estimates regularly, including reviewing the significant accounting policies impacting the estimates, to ensure compliance with u.s. gaap. however, due to the uncertainty inherent in our estimates, actual results may be materially different. we have identified the accounting estimates below as critical to understanding and evaluating the financial results reported in our consolidated financial statements.
for a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 1, "basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies" of the notes.
pension and other postretirement benefits our defined benefit pension plans cover certain current and former employees in canada, the u.k. (within our europe segment) and japan (within our mci segment). our other postretirement benefit ("opeb") plans provide medical benefits for retirees and their eligible dependents as well as life insurance for certain retirees in canada, the u.s., and europe. the canada and u.k. defined benefit pension plans are primarily funded, but the japan plan and all opeb plans are unfunded. we also offer defined contribution plans in each of our segments.
accounting for pension and opeb plans requires that we make assumptions that involve considerable judgment which are significant inputs in the actuarial models that measure our net pension and opeb obligations and ultimately impact our earnings. these include the discount rate, long-term expected rate of return on assets, compensation trends, inflation considerations, health care cost trends and other assumptions, as well as determining the fair value of assets in our funded plans.
specifically, the discount rates, as well as the expected rates of return on assets and plan asset fair value determination, are important assumptions used in determining the plans' funded status and annual net periodic pension and opeb benefit costs. we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country-specific basis. we also, with the help of actuaries, periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors, such as retirement age, mortality and turnover, and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our net pension and postretirement benefit obligations and related expense.
discount rates the assumed discount rates are used to present-value future benefit obligations based on each plan's respective duration. the canada pension and postretirement discount rates are based on our annual evaluation of high quality corporate bonds in the canada market based on appropriate indices and actuarial guidance. the u.k. pension discount rate is based on information obtained from our actuary and reviewed in comparison with a published bond index reflective of the duration of our defined benefit pension obligations. we believe that our discount rate assumptions are appropriate; however, significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and opeb obligations and related expense.
at december 31, 2015, on a weighted-average basis, the discount rates used were 3.82% for our defined benefit pension plans and 4.05% for our opeb plans. this is a minimal change from the weighted-average discount rates of 3.70% for our defined benefit pension plans and 4.15% for our postretirement plans at december 31, 2014, resulting from a challenging global economic environment.

a 50 basis point change in our discount rate assumptions would have had the following effects on the projected benefit obligation balances as of december 31, 2015, for our pension and opeb plans:

our u.k. pension plan includes benefits linked to inflation. the above sensitivity analysis does not consider the implications to inflation resulting from the above contemplated discount rate changes. this sensitivity holds all other assumptions constant.
long term expected rates of return on assets the assumed long-term expected return on assets ("eroa") is used to estimate the actual return that will occur on each individual funded plan's respective plan assets in the upcoming year. we determine each plan's eroa with substantial input from independent investment specialists, including our actuaries and other consultants. in developing each plan's eroa, we consider current and expected asset allocations, historical market rates as well as historical and expected returns on each plan's individual asset classes. in developing future return expectations for each of our plan's assets, we evaluate general market trends as well as key elements of asset class returns such as expected earnings growth, yields and spreads. the calculation includes inputs for interest, inflation, credit, and risk premium (active investment management) rates and fees paid to service providers. based on the above factors and expected asset allocations, we have assumed, on a weighted-average basis, an eroa of 5.09% for our defined benefit pension plan assets for cost recognition in 2016. this is a decrease from the weighted-average rate of 5.46% we had assumed in 2015. we believe that our eroa assumptions are appropriate; however, significant changes in our assumptions or actual returns that differ significantly from estimated returns may materially affect our net periodic pension costs.
our eroa assumptions are applied to each of our plan's assets using the "market-related value", which utilizes a delayed approach to recognition of asset-related gains and losses to reduce volatility resulting from significant market movements. specifically, while employer contributions and realized gains and losses (such as dividends received or gains and losses on sales of assets) are reflected immediately in the market-related value of assets, each year's unrealized gains and losses are amortized into the market-related value over five years. therefore, significant divergences of actual returns from expected returns may not have an immediate impact on each of our plan's future net periodic pension costs; rather, such differences will be amortized over the five years following the event. therefore, future years' pension expense will continue to be impacted by the gains and losses experienced in prior years.
a 50 basis point change in our discount rate and expected return on assets assumptions made at the beginning of 2015 would have had the following effects on 2015 net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs:

fair value of plan assets we recognize our defined benefit pension plans as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets based on their underfunded or overfunded status as of our year end and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur within other comprehensive income. our funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is measured as the
63
difference between each plan's projected benefit obligation ("pbo") and its assets' fair values. the fair value of plan assets is determined by us using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. however, considerable judgment is required in selecting an appropriate methodology and interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value, especially in the absence of quoted market values in an active market. changes in these assumptions or the use of different market inputs may have a material impact on the estimated fair values or the ultimate amount at which the plan assets are available to satisfy our plan obligations.
equity assets are diversified between domestic and other international investments. relative allocations reflect the demographics of the respective plan participants. see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 15, "employee retirement plans and postretirement benefits" of the notes for a comparison of target asset allocation percentages to actual asset allocations at december 31, 2015.
other considerations our net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs are also influenced by the potential amortization (or non-amortization) from accumulated other comprehensive income of deferred gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from estimates. we employ the corridor approach for determining each plan's amortization. this approach defines the "corridor" as the greater of 10% of the pbo or 10% of the market-related value of plan assets (as discussed above) and requires amortization of the excess net gain or loss that exceeds the corridor over the average remaining service periods of active plan participants in canada. as our u.k. plan is closed, the average remaining life expectancy of all plan participants (including retirees) is used. if our actuarial losses significantly exceed this corridor in the future, significant incremental pension and postretirement costs could result. as of year end 2015, the deferred losses of several of our canadian plans, as well as those in our u.k. plan, exceeded the 10% corridor.
the assumed health care cost trend rates represent the rates at which health care costs are assumed to increase and are based on actuarial input and consideration of historical and expected experience. we use these trends as a significant assumption in determining our postretirement benefit obligation and related costs. changes in our projections of future health care costs due to general economic conditions and those specific to health care will impact this trend rate. an increase in the trend rate would increase our obligation and expense of our postretirement health care plan. we believe that our health care cost trend rate assumptions are appropriate; however, significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our postretirement benefit obligations and related costs. at december 31, 2015, the health care trend rates used were ranging ratably from 7.7% in 2016 to 4.5% in 2028, consistent with rates used at december 31, 2014. see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 15, "employee retirement plans and postretirement benefits" of the notes for the impact of a one-percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates on total service and interest cost components and postretirement benefit obligation at december 31, 2015.
contingencies, environmental and litigation reserves contingencies, environmental and litigation reserves are recorded, when probable, using our best estimate of loss. this estimate, involving significant judgment, is based on an evaluation of the range of loss related to such matters and where the amount and range can be reasonably estimated. these matters are generally resolved over a number of years and only when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. following our initial determination, we regularly reassess and revise the potential liability related to any pending matters as new information becomes available. unless capitalization is allowed or required by u.s. gaap, environmental and legal costs are expensed when incurred. we disclose pending loss contingencies when the loss is deemed reasonably possible, which requires significant judgment. as a result of the inherent uncertainty of these matters, the ultimate conclusion and actual cost of settlement may materially differ from our estimates. we recognize contingent gains upon the determination that realization is assured beyond a reasonable doubt, regardless of the perceived probability of a favorable outcome prior to achieving that assurance. in the instance of gain contingencies resulting from favorable litigation, due to the numerous uncertainties inherent in a legal proceeding, gain contingencies resulting from legal settlements are not recognized in income until cash or other forms of payment are received. if significant and probable, we disclose as appropriate.
see part i-item 3 legal proceedings and part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 18, "commitments and contingencies" of the notes for a discussion of our contingencies, environmental and litigation reserves as of december 31, 2015.
goodwill and intangible asset valuation goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit in which the business that created the goodwill resides. a reporting unit is an operating segment, or a business unit one level below that operating segment, for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. the operations in each of the specific regions within our canada, europe and mci segments are components based on the availability of discrete financial information and the regular review by segment management. therefore, the components within each respective segment must be evaluated for aggregation to
64
determine if the components have similar economic characteristics. as a result, in certain cases, we have aggregated business units, within an operating segment, into one reporting unit if the specific aggregation criteria under u.s. gaap is met. specifically, we have concluded that the components within the canada and europe segment each meet the criteria as having similar economic characteristics and therefore have aggregated these components into the canada and europe reporting units, respectively. therefore, the canada and europe reporting units are consistent with our operating segments. however, for our india business, the reporting unit is one level below the mci operating segment. any change to the conclusion of our reporting units or the aggregation of components within our reporting units could result in a different outcome to our annual impairment test. our significant indefinite-lived intangible assets include the molson core brands and the coors light distribution rights in canada, and the carling and staropramen brands in europe.
we evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or when an interim triggering event occurs that would indicate that impairment may have taken place. consistent with 2014, our annual impairment test was performed as of october 1, the first day of the last fiscal quarter. we evaluate our other definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when evidence exists that certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. significant judgments and assumptions are required in such impairment evaluations.
our annual evaluation involves comparing each reporting unit's fair value to its respective carrying value, including goodwill. if the fair value exceeds carrying value, then we conclude that no goodwill impairment has occurred. if a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss. this step, if required, would include valuing all tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, excluding goodwill. then, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill derived from this step would be compared to the carrying value of that goodwill. if the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill were to exceed the implied fair value of the goodwill, we would recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess.
we use a combination of discounted cash flow analyses and market approaches to determine the fair value of each of our reporting units, and an excess earnings approach to determine the fair values of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. our discounted cash flow projections include assumptions for growth rates for sales, costs and profits, which are based on various long-range financial and operational plans of each reporting unit or each indefinite-lived intangible asset. additionally, discount rates used in our goodwill analysis are based on weighted-average cost of capital, driven by the prevailing interest rates in geographies where these businesses operate, as well as the credit ratings, financing abilities and opportunities of each reporting unit, among other factors. discount rates for the indefinite-lived intangible analysis by brand largely reflect the rates supporting the overall reporting unit valuation but may differ slightly to adjust for country or market specific risk associated with a particular brand. our market-based valuations utilize earnings multiples of comparable public companies, which are reflective of the market in which each respective reporting unit operates, and recent comparable market transactions.
changes in the factors used in our fair value estimates, including declines in industry or company-specific beer volume sales, margin erosion, termination of brewing and/or distribution agreements with other brewers, and discount rates used, could have a significant impact on the fair values of the reporting units.
reporting units and goodwill our 2015 annual goodwill impairment testing determined that while our canada reporting unit improved from the prior year, our europe reporting unit declined and was determined to be at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test. specifically, the fair value of the europe and canada reporting units were estimated at approximately 9% and 20% in excess of carrying value, respectively, as of the october 1, 2015, testing date. the excess of the fair value over the carrying value of the europe reporting unit declined from the prior year. the decrease was driven by continued challenging macroeconomic conditions in europe negatively impacting our business, as well as declines in the forecasts of certain european brands, which have been adversely impacted by competitive pressures and a continued shift in consumer trends towards value brands. these impacts were partially offset by a lower discount rate. the canada reporting unit had an increase to the fair value in excess of the carrying value from the prior year primarily due to a lower discount rate, an improved forecast primarily driven by cost savings initiatives and improved market multiples. although the fair value in excess of the carrying value has increased for the canada reporting unit from the october 1, 2014, testing date, the fair value is sensitive to potential unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows, macroeconomic conditions, market multiples or discount rates that could have an adverse impact. the fair value of the india reporting unit was deemed to approximate the carrying value due to purchase price accounting performed as of april 1, 2015, for the mount shivalik acquisition, which comprises the majority of the india reporting unit.
intangible assets prior to the annual impairment testing date of october 1, 2015, and during the third quarter of 2015, we identified impairment indicators as it pertains to certain european indefinite-lived brands driven by key changes to our underlying
65
assumptions supporting the value of the brands. specific changes included under-performance through the 2015 peak season which drove a downward shift in management's forecasts, a challenging macroeconomic environment and competitive conditions not expected to subside in the near-term, as well as higher discount rates associated with these brands. as a result, we recorded an aggregate impairment charge across various european brands, including jelen, of $275.0 million within special items in the third quarter of 2015. compared to previously made assumptions, these lower projected cash flows and higher discount rates resulted in lower brand valuations following impairments of $360.0 million in 2014 and $150.9 million in 2013 related to european indefinite-lived brands as a result of our 2014 and 2013 annual impairment testing, respectively. the remaining europe indefinite-lived intangibles' fair values, including staropramen and carling brands, while they faced similar macroeconomic challenges, were sufficiently in excess of their respective carrying values as of the testing date.
in conjunction with the interim brand impairment review performed during the third quarter, we also reassessed each brand's indefinite-life classification and determined that those brands which had been impaired had characteristics that indicated a definite-life assignment was more appropriate including continued pressure on these brands given the geographical markets and price segments in which they participate. specifically, significant competition from the value segment, which has challenged the segment in which these brands operate with continued stress on these brands driven by on-going macroeconomic conditions. these brands were therefore reclassified as definite-lived intangible assets as of september 30, 2015, and will be amortized over their useful lives ranging from 30 to 50 years. no additional triggering events were identified in 2015 associated with the brands reclassified to definite-lived intangible assets.
separately, our molson core brand intangible continues to be at risk of future impairment with a fair value estimated at approximately 3% in excess of its carrying value as of the impairment testing date. the fair value of the molson core brands in excess of carrying value decreased marginally from the prior year, as they continue to face significant competitive pressures and challenging macroeconomic conditions in the canada market. these challenges continue to be offset by anticipated cost savings initiatives. as of december 31, 2015, the molson core brand intangible had a carrying value of approximately $2.2 billion. the fair value of the coors light brand distribution rights and our other indefinite-lived intangibles in canada continue to be sufficiently in excess of their carrying values.
we utilized level 3 fair value measurements in our impairment analysis of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, which utilizes an excess earnings approach to determine the fair values of the assets as of the testing date. the future cash flows used in the analysis are based on internal cash flow projections based on our long range plans and include significant assumptions by management as noted below.
key assumptions the europe reporting unit goodwill and the molson core brand intangible asset are at risk of future impairment in the event of significant unfavorable changes in the forecasted cash flows (including prolonged, or further weakening of, adverse economic conditions or significant unfavorable changes in tax, environmental or other regulations, including interpretations thereof), terminal growth rates, market transaction multiples and/or weighted-average cost of capital utilized in the discounted cash flow analyses. for testing purposes, management's best estimates of the expected future results are the primary driver in determining the fair value. current projections used for our europe reporting unit testing reflect continued challenging environments in the future followed by growth resulting from a longer term recovery of the macroeconomic environment, as well as the benefit of anticipated cost savings and specific brand-building and innovation activities. our molson core brand projections also reflect a continued challenging environment that has been adversely impacted by a weak economy across all industries, as well as weakened consumer demand driven by increased competitive pressures, partially offset by anticipated cost savings and specific brand-building and innovation activities. fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. as a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles may include such items as: (i) a decrease in expected future cash flows, specifically, a decrease in sales volume and increase in costs that could significantly impact our immediate and long-range results, a decrease in sales volume driven by a prolonged weakness in consumer demand or other competitive pressures adversely affecting our long term volume trends, a continuation of the trend away from core brands in certain of our markets, especially in markets where our core brands represent a significant portion of the market, unfavorable working capital changes and an inability to successfully achieve our cost savings targets, (ii) adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions or an economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing and/or degree (such as a recession or worsening of the overall european economy), (iii) volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors which could result in a higher weighted-average cost of capital, (iv) sensitivity to market multiples; and (v) regulation limiting or banning the manufacturing, distribution or sale of alcoholic beverages.

our analysis of the canada reporting unit and related indefinite-lived intangible brand assets included consideration of the new framework with the province of ontario, which became effective as of january 1, 2016, and includes the forecasted implications to mcbc of an additional cad 100.0 million annual tax on all beer volume sold in ontario (which will be phased in over four years beginning january 1, 2016), restrictions on price increases for certain packaging types of the largest ontario brands until the second quarter of 2017, bri committing to invest cad 100.0 million of capital spending through 2018, increasing the number and types of outlets where beer is sold, increasing the required level of shelf space allocated to small brewers in retail outlets, as well as allowing for incremental packaging options at the liquor control board of ontario ("lcbo") and agents of the lcbo.
based on known facts and circumstances, we evaluate and consider other recent events and uncertain items, as well as related potential implications, as part of our annual assessment and incorporate into the analyses as appropriate. these facts and circumstances are subject to change and may impact future analyses.
in 2015, the discount rates used in developing our fair value estimates for each of our reporting units were 8.0% and 9.0% and for our canada and europe reporting units, respectively. these compared to discount rates used in our 2014 testing of 8.5% and 9.5% for our canada and europe reporting units, respectively. in 2015, discount rates used for testing of indefinite-lived intangibles ranged from 8.0% to 14.5% considering the country specific risk premium for each geography in which our brands are based. the decrease in the discount rates is primarily due to a reduction in the unsystematic risk premium as we refined inputs compared to those used in our historical discounted cash flow analyses as well as reduction in risk free rates between testing dates. consistent with the prior year testing, we assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of our water rights, an indefinite-lived intangible, was greater than its carrying amount and determined that a full quantitative analysis was not necessary.
while historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of our reporting units in excess of carrying values, if our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future. for example, a 50 basis point increase in our discount rate assumptions, which is within a reasonable range of historical discount rate fluctuations between test dates, would have had the following effects on the fair value cushion in excess of carrying value for the europe and canada reporting units and molson core brands as of the october 1, 2015, test date:
impact to the fair value cushion as of october 1, 2015
- 50 basis points increase cushion (pre-sensitivity)                        cushion (post-sensitivity)
% of fair value in excess of carrying value reporting units:
europe                          9%                                               1%
canada                          20%                                              11%
indefinite-lived intangibles:
molson core brands              3%                                               -5%
post sensitivity, the fair values of the europe and canada reporting units remain in excess of the their carrying values. the negative cushion associated with the molson core brands would imply impairment if the discount rate assumptions used in the october 1, 2015, test increased by 50 basis points. the discount rate sensitivity holds all other assumptions and inputs constant.
regarding definite-lived intangibles, we continuously monitor the performance of the underlying asset for potential triggering events suggesting an impairment review should be performed. no such triggering events were identified in 2015. in addition, no such triggering events were identified in 2014 or 2013, with the exception of the license agreement settlement and preceding litigation with miller in canada, which resulted in $8.9 million and $17.9 million of impairment charges of our definite-lived intangible asset in 2014 and 2013, respectively. we utilized level 3 fair value measurements in our impairment analysis of this definite-lived intangible asset, which included cash flow assumptions by management related to the transition period. see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 11, "goodwill and intangible assets" of the notes for further discussion.
as of december 31, 2015, the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets were $2.0 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively. if actual performance results differ significantly from our projections or we experience significant fluctuations in our other assumptions, a material impairment charge may occur in the future. see part ii-item 8 financial statements and supplementary data, note 11, "goodwill and intangible assets" of the notes for further discussion and presentation of these amounts.

income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with u.s. gaap. judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. additionally, our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by many different tax authorities. we adjust our income tax provision in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates. tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted.
we are periodically subject to tax return audits by both foreign and domestic tax authorities, which can involve questions regarding our tax positions. settlement of any challenge resulting from these audits can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits. we measure and record the tax benefits from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. our estimated liabilities related to these matters are adjusted in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations for examination expires or when additional information becomes available. our liability for unrecognized tax benefits requires the use of assumptions and significant judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. although we believe that the judgments and estimates made are reasonable, actual results could differ and resulting adjustments could materially affect our effective income tax rate and income tax provision.
we annually receive cash from our foreign subsidiaries' current year earnings. separately, we treat all accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings through december 31, 2015, as indefinitely reinvested under the accounting guidance and accordingly have not provided for any u.s. or foreign tax thereon. in order to arrive at this conclusion, we considered factors including, but not limited to, past experience, domestic cash requirements and distributions from millercoors, as well as cash requirements to satisfy the ongoing operations, capital expenditures and other financial obligations of our foreign subsidiaries. as of december 31, 2015, approximately $20 million of undistributed earnings and profits attributable to foreign subsidiaries was considered to be indefinitely invested. our intention is to permanently reinvest the earnings outside of the u.s. it is not practicable to determine the amount of incremental taxes that might arise were these earnings to be remitted. the amount of tax payable could be impacted by the jurisdiction in which a distribution was made, the amount of the distribution, foreign withholding taxes under applicable tax laws when distributed, relevant tax treaties and foreign tax credits. while it is not practical to determine the amount of tax, we believe that u.s. foreign tax credits and tax planning strategies would allow us to make remittances in a tax efficient manner.
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. we evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income, including the reversal of existing temporary differences, historical and projected operating results, and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. the realization of tax benefits is evaluated by jurisdiction and the realizability of these assets can vary based on the character of the tax attribute and the carryforward periods specific to each jurisdiction. in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease income tax expense in the period a determination was made. likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be recorded to income tax expense in the period such determination was made.
new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted revenue recognition in may 2014, the fasb issued authoritative guidance related to new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. the core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for the goods or services. in august 2015, the fasb affirmed its proposal to defer the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard for all entities by one year. as a result, the requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. in conjunction with the deferral, the fasb will permit all entities to apply the new revenue recognition standard early, but not before the original effective date. the use of either a full retrospective or cumulative effect transition method is permitted. we have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the potential impact on our financial position and results of operations upon adoption of this guidance.

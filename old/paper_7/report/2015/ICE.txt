on june 24, 2014, we sold an aggregate 65.8 million shares of common stock of euronext, representing 94% of all outstanding shares, in three transactions. the three transactions include our sale of 42.2 million shares of euronext common stock in an initial public offering, or ipo, at €20 per share, 23.4 million shares of euronext common stock to a group of european institutional investors at €19.20 per share, and 0.2 million shares of euronext common stock to eligible euronext employees at €16 per share. on december 9, 2014, we sold our remaining 4.2 million shares of euronext common stock, representing 6% of the outstanding shares of euronext, for €95 million ($118 million). we no longer hold any shares of euronext stock and these four transactions generated an aggregate €1.5 billion ($2.1 billion) of net cash proceeds for us. the net cash proceeds received included cash of $220 million distributed from euronext as part of the separation of euronext from us. euronext was comprised of continental european-based exchanges acquired by us as part of the nyse acquisition.
nyse previously operated a commercial technology business, nyse technologies, which offered transaction, data and infrastructure services, and managed solutions for market participants. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we sold nyfix, metabit and wombat, the three companies that comprised nyse technologies. these sales completed our previously announced intention to divest non-core nyse technologies assets.

(1) the adjusted numbers in the table above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance, net of taxes, as applicable. as a result, these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap. see "- non-gaap financial measures" below.
•   total revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $246 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to increases in the data services fee revenues, listing fee revenues and brent crude futures and options transaction and clearing revenues. the data services fee revenues increase was partially due to $50 million in data services fee revenues from interactive data and trayport during the year ended december 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions in december 2015. these increases were partially offset by decreases in certain interest rate futures and options transaction and clearing revenues compared to the prior year periods. see "- revenues" below for further information as well as a discussion of the other changes in revenues. also offsetting the revenue increases were the impacts of a strengthening u.s. dollar on our foreign currency exchange rates (primarily for those revenues billed in pounds sterling and euros), which reduced our revenues by $55 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. see item 3 "- quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency exchange rate risk" below for additional information on the impact of currency fluctuations.
•   total revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $1.494 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily due to an increase of $1.461 billion in revenues, less transaction-based expenses, recognized relating to the inclusion of nyse, including $1.669 billion in nyse revenues, less transaction-based expenses, for the year ended december 31, 2014 versus $208 million in nyse revenues, less transaction-based expenses, for the
40
period from november 13, 2013 to december 31, 2013. see "- revenues" below for further information on the nyse revenues as well as a discussion of the other changes in revenues.
•   total operating expenses decreased $56 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to decreases in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs (related to lower nyse integration costs, partially offset by interactive data and trayport acquisition-related transaction costs) and decreases in professional services expenses (related to the reduction in professional services and contractors at nyse). operating expenses also decreased due to the impact of a strengthening u.s. dollar on our foreign currency exchange rates (primarily for those operating expenses incurred in pounds sterling and euros), which reduced our operating expenses by $17 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. these decreases were partially offset by increases in depreciation expenses compared to the prior year periods primarily due to fixed asset additions relating to the nyse integration and real estate expenditures relating primarily to the atlanta and new york headquarters. we also had increases in operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2015 of $41 million from interactive data and trayport, subsequent to their acquisitions in december 2015. see "- operating expenses" below for further information as well as a discussion of the other changes in expenses.
•   total operating expenses increased $836 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily due to $756 million in expenses recognized relating to the inclusion of nyse, net of integration costs ($1.007 billion in nyse expenses for the period ended december 31, 2014, including $123 million in integration costs, versus $171 million in nyse expenses for the period from november 13, 2013 to december 31, 2013, including $43 million in integration costs). see "- operating expenses" below for further information on the nyse expenses as well as a discussion of the other changes in expenses.
•   during the year ended december 31, 2015, other income (expense), net includes $15 million in various litigation settlements and accruals. during the year ended december 31, 2014, other income (expense), net includes $25 million in equity income from our equity investment in occ. during the year ended december 31, 2013, other income (expense), net includes a $190 million impairment loss on our cetip investment and a $51 million expense relating to the early payoff of outstanding debt. see "- non-operating income (expenses)" below.
•   the lower effective tax rate and income tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2015 is primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with future u.k. income tax rate reductions along with certain favorable settlements with various taxing authorities. the higher effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2013 is primarily due to the non-tax deductible impairment loss on the cetip investment. see "- income tax provision" below.
•   income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 include the results of euronext and nyse technologies subsequent to the nyse acquisition on november 13, 2013 through their dispositions. see "- discontinued operations" below.
factors affecting our results and business and market trends the business environments in which we operate directly affect our results of operations. our results have been and will continue to be affected by many factors, including market volatility and the level of trading activity in our markets, which during any period is significantly influenced by general market conditions; legislative and regulatory changes, as well as our fulfillment of our regulatory obligations; competition; demand for our data services and our market share; our system reliability; our ability to offer new products; our acquisition activities and the pace of industry consolidation; broad trends in the data and finance industry; the number and financial health of companies listed on our cash markets; geopolitical events; real and perceived supply and demand imbalances; changing technology in the financial services industry; and our reputation, among other factors. in particular, in recent years, the business environment has been characterized by increasing competition among global markets for trading volumes and listings; the globalization of exchanges, customers and competitors; market participants' demand for speed, capacity and reliability, which requires continuing investment in technology; and, increasing competition for market data revenues. price volatility increases the need to hedge risk and creates demand among market participants for the exchange of risk. market liquidity is one of the primary market attributes for attracting and maintaining customers and is an important indicator of a market's strength. the maintenance and growth of our revenues could also be impacted if we face increased pressure on pricing.
the implementation of new regulations may impact participation in our markets. many of the proposed changes with regard to global financial reform are still being determined and have yet to be implemented. in europe, final regulations have not yet been adopted and significant uncertainties and ambiguities remain around such regulations. as this is established, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. as a result, it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. however, it may possibly result in increased costs and the expenditure of significant
41
resources. as discussed more fully in item 1 "- business - regulation" included elsewhere in this annual report, the implementation of mifid ii and its counterpart emir, may result in operational, regulatory and/or business risk.
low interest rates and uncertainty in the financial markets continued to reflect the impact of a slow global economic recovery. equity market indices became increasingly volatile in the second half of 2015. economic uncertainty in the asia and the european union may also continue to negatively affect global financial markets. in addition, economic uncertainty has continued to affect our clients' activities, business models and investment over the last several years. we expect that all of these factors will continue to impact our businesses. we have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility, trading activity or participation in any one asset class. in addition, we have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 13% in 2012 to 44% in 2015. this non-transaction revenue includes data and listings, and will continue to increase as a percent of our total revenue with the addition of interactive data and trayport revenues reflected in our full year results. we continue to focus on our strategy to grow our revenue streams, as well as on our company-wide expense reduction initiatives in connection with our acquisitions in order to mitigate these uncertainties.
in recent years, financial institutions globally have acted to control or reduce spending, including spending on financial information and related services. yet many of the data products and services we sell are required for our clients' business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. while we expect that cost reduction and cost containment pressures will continue, we anticipate that there will be overall growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including the following: increasing u.s. and global regulatory demands; investor demands for transparency; greater use of fair value accounting standards; greater emphasis on risk management; market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes; the move to passive investing and indexation; ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets; increased electronification of fixed income markets; and increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions. we contract with clients through data fixed-fee subscriptions (on either a multi-year, annual, quarterly or monthly basis), variable fees based on usage or a combination of fixed-fee subscription and usage-based fees. in addition, some of our data services generate one-time or non-recurring revenue, such as one-time purchases of historical data, set-up services or implementation fees.
interactive data's pricing and reference data business grew in 2015 primarily due to expansion in north america and europe. growth was driven by strong revenue retention rates; increased demand from existing clients and, to a lesser extent, new clients; contributions from recently launched products; and the effect of price increases. quarterly revenue retention rates for the pricing and reference data business, which is calculated as 100% less the dollar magnitude of cancellations (including revenue declines from continuing customers related to service downgrades, renegotiations, price reductions and usage declines) received during the prior 12 months divided by the annualized quarterly revenue at the beginning of that same 12-month period, have averaged 94% since 2007, and were 95% for 2015.

transaction and clearing fees our transaction and clearing fees are reported on a net basis, except for the transaction-based expenses discussed below, and consist of fees collected from our derivatives trading and clearing and from our u.s. cash trading and equity options businesses. in our derivatives markets, we earn transaction and clearing fees from both counterparties to each contract that is traded and/or cleared. we receive transaction fee revenues from u.s. equity and equity options markets through the new york stock exchange, nyse arca, nyse mkt, nyse amex options and nyse arca options, including routing fees related to orders in our markets which are routed to other markets for execution.
revenues per-contract are driven by the number of trades executed and fees charged per contract, net of certain rebates. the amount of our per-contract transaction and clearing fees will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, pricing, applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements, product mix and new product introductions. because transaction and clearing fees are assessed on a per-contract or notional value basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume but not to the same degree due to product mix and pricing. see "- factors affecting our results" above.
in 2015, ice brent crude futures and options contracts produced the nineteenth consecutive year of record volume. the brent crude futures contract is relied upon by a broad range of global market participants, including oil producing nations and multinational companies, to price and hedge their crude oil production and consumption. brent crude futures and options volume increased 14% for year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to increased volatility in oil prices following price declines and the continuing uncertainty around supply, demand and storage. based on traded volume in our brent and wti crude futures contracts, we had 49%, 54% and 55% market share of the global crude futures contracts volume for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. while total oil volume and revenues increased during 2015,
43
global crude market share declined due to greater volatility in wti crude oil prices relative to brent crude oil prices, which drove more trading by non-commercial firms in wti.
we receive transaction and clearing fee revenues from executing and clearing trades on european interest rate futures and options and additional agriculture and equity derivatives futures and options. trading volume in european interest rate products is primarily driven by volatility resulting from expectations for changes in the level and term structure of short-term interest rates and in economic data, and trading in equity derivatives, including equity indexes and single stock futures, is primarily driven by volatility. interest rate futures and options volume decreased 11% for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to the low interest rate environment and the associated low volatility of the prevailing zero-interest rate policy in the european union.
natural gas revenue increased 3% and volume declined 4% for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, and natural gas revenue declined 6% and volume declined 22% for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013. the revenue increase in 2015 and the relatively lower decrease in revenue in 2014, compared to the volume decreases, was driven by growth in european natural gas volume, which has a higher transaction fee as compared to the north american natural gas contract, where volume declined year over year. decreased north american natural gas volume was primarily due to continued low volatility and low price levels, which produced muted trading activity in comparison to the year ended december 31, 2013. in addition, moderate commodity demand due to muted economic growth, regulatory uncertainty and strong natural gas supply reduced the demand for trading and hedging during 2015 and 2014.
ice gasoil is a key refined oil products benchmark in europe and asia, which completed its transition to a new gasoil specification in january 2015. gasoil futures and options volumes increased 19% for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, and decreased 17% for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013. the increase in volume during the year ended december 31, 2015 is primarily due to greater price volatility associated with oil price volatility and following the transition to the low sulphur gasoil specification. the transition to the new gasoil specification helped contribute to the lower gasoil volumes during the year ended december 31, 2014.
other oil revenue and volume grew during the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to oil price volatility and the introduction of new oil products, as well as the increased use of clearing related to regulatory requirements.
sugar revenue and volume grew during the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to price volatility and currency volatility in key currencies. price volatility was driven by prospects for a bigger than expected shortfall of sugar production after several seasons of surplus. also, forecast for a stronger than expected el nino impact are generating uncertainty over sugar production estimates.
cds clearing revenues for ice clear credit and ice clear europe were $101 million, $97 million and $79 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, ice clear credit and ice clear europe cleared $11.9 trillion, $13.7 trillion and $10.7 trillion, respectively, of cds notional value. buyside participation at ice clear credit continues to grow by both u.s. and european buyside participants due to the availability of products and cost efficient margining in the u.s. relative to europe.
cds trade execution revenues at creditex and ice swap trade were $49 million, $64 million and $66 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the notional value of the underlying cds traded was $867.7 billion, $1.0 trillion and $904.4 billion for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. cds trading remains muted due to financial reform implementation and lower volatility in corporate credit markets.
u.s. cash equities handled volume increased 14% for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to an increase in the total consolidated equities volume and an increase in our market share for the year ended december 31, 2015. u.s. cash equities revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $220 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, an increase of 17% from net u.s. cash equities revenues of $188 million for the year ended december 31, 2014.
u.s. equity options volume decreased 20% for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the restructuring of the nyse amex options business. net u.s. equity options revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $112 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, a decrease of 23% from net u.s. equity options revenues of $145 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. while revenues declined during 2015, the overall financial contribution of equity options was consistent with the prior year due to the retention of a higher percentage of profits from nyse amex options driven by our repurchase of the equity in the exchange from the minority shareholders.

our transaction and clearing fees are presented net of rebates. we recorded rebates of $563 million, $466 million and $497 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. the increase in the rebates is due primarily to the rebates relating to the addition of european interest rate derivatives markets following the nyse acquisition, an increase in the number of participants in the rebate programs offered on various contracts and an increase in the number of rebate programs. the level of rebates as a percentage of our total transaction and clearing fees has remained relatively consistent for the past several years.

the table above excludes european single stock equities in the other financial futures and options number of contracts traded and rate per contract amounts for all periods shown. the revenue associated with european single stock equities trading activity is capped and, therefore, there is very little correlation between volumes and revenue.
open interest is the aggregate number of contracts (long or short) that clearing members hold either for their own account or on behalf of their clients. open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently open - in other words, contracts that have been traded but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade, exercise, expiration or assignment. open interest is also a measure of the future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and their clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange. the following table presents our year-end open interest for our futures and options contracts (in millions, except for percentages).

data services fees we generate revenues from a range of data services, including the dissemination of our market data, data analytics, delivery services and benchmark administration to a variety of customers. in our derivatives markets, data fees primarily relate to subscription fees charged for customer and license access from data vendors and from the end users, view only data access, direct access services, terminal access, daily indices, forward curves and other valuation services, and end of day reports. we earn data fees relating to our cash equity and options markets, and related data and network services. we also earn additional data services fee revenues following our recent acquisitions of superderivatives, interactive data and trayport.
we earn data services fees relating to our u.s. equity market data services. we collect cash trading market data fees principally for consortium-based data products and, to a lesser extent, for nyse proprietary data products. consortium-based data
47
fees are dictated as part of the securities industry plans and charged to vendors based on their redistribution of data. consortium-based data revenues from the dissemination of market data (net of administrative costs) are distributed to participating markets on the basis of a formula set by the sec under regulation nms. last sale prices and quotes in new york stock exchange-listed, nyse mkt-listed, and nyse arca-listed securities are disseminated through "tape a" and "tape b," which constitute the majority of our u.s. revenues from consortium-based market data revenues. data services fee revenues exclude euronext data services fee revenues, which are included in income from discontinued operations. see "- discontinued operations" below.
our data delivery services include our colocation and secured financial transaction infrastructure, or sfti, network and provide timely, reliable and secure transmission of our data to customers. sfti is a physical network infrastructure that connects our markets and other major market centers with numerous market participants in the u.s. and europe and allows those participants to receive data feeds. sfti is a redundant network that supports a range of nyse services and third-party content and connects all nms market centers in the u.s.
we formed iba to serve as an administrator of regulated benchmarks. iba became the benchmark administrator of libor in february 2014, the ice swap rate (formerly isdafix) in august 2014 and lbma gold price in march 2015. iba charges a license fee for usage, redistribution, trading/clearing and historical access for these benchmarks.
we acquired superderivatives on october 7, 2014. superderivatives is a provider of risk management analytics, financial market data and valuation services. we acquired interactive data on december 14, 2015 and trayport on december 11, 2015. interactive data is a provider of financial market data, analytics and related trading solutions, serving the mutual fund, bank, asset management, hedge fund, securities and financial instrument processing and administration sectors. trayport is a software company that licenses its technology to serve exchanges, otc brokers and traders to facilitate electronic and hybrid trade execution primary in the energy markets.
our data services fee revenues increased during the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to the addition of new users, increased usage by customers, expanded product offerings, fee increases and the addition of superderivatives and iba for all of 2015 and interactive data and trayport subsequent to their acquisitions in december 2015. we recognized $50 million in combined data services revenues for interactive data and trayport during the month of december 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions dates. our data services fee revenues increased during the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily due to including nyse's related data services revenues for the entire year in 2014, superderivatives subsequent to its acquisition in 2014, and ice benchmark administration subsequent to its formation in 2014.
listing fees we recognize listing fee revenues in our securities markets from two types of fees applicable to companies listed on our u.s. cash equities exchanges - original listing fees and annual listing fees. original listing fees consist of two components: initial listing fees and fees related to other corporate-related actions. initial listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. initial listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods of nine years for nyse and five years for nyse arca and nyse mkt. annual fees are charged based on the number of outstanding shares of listed u.s. companies at the end of the prior year. non-u.s. companies pay fees based on the number of listed securities issued or held in the u.s. annual fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the calendar year.
in addition, other corporate action related fees are paid by listed companies in connection with corporate actions involving the issuance of new shares to be listed, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions. other corporate action related fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods of six years for nyse and three years for nyse arca and nyse mkt. unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet.
we determined that, at the time of our acquisition of nyse, we did not have a legal performance obligation relating to these listing fees. therefore, in connection with purchase accounting and in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or u.s. gaap, we assigned a fair value of zero to the nyse unamortized deferred revenue balances relating to the listing fees as of the acquisition date of november 13, 2013 (the historical original listing fees deferred revenue balance as of that date was $486 million). the listing fees unamortized deferred revenue balance as of december 31, 2015 of $109 million relates to original and other corporate action listing fees incurred and billed and not yet recognized as revenue subsequent to the november 13, 2013 acquisition through december 31, 2015. listing fees revenues exclude euronext listing fee revenues, which are included in income from discontinued operations. see "- discontinued operations" below.

fees we receive from nyse governance services are included in listing fee revenues. nyse governance services is a leading provider of corporate governance, risk and compliance services to a diverse set of customers, including a number of those listed on nyse. the true office acquisition is included in with nyse governance services.
listing fee revenues increased for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to the amortization of the original listing fees incurred since the acquisition of nyse and due to additional annual listing fee revenue recognized due to these new customers.
other revenues other revenues relate to various fees for services provided to our customers, including fees for facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our u.s. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, ice endex membership fees, agricultural grading and certification fees, regulatory penalties and fines, and interest income on certain clearing margin deposits.
the increase in other revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, is primarily due to increases in the interest income recognized on certain clearing margin deposits and fees earned on non-cash collateral placed by clearing members primarily due to fee changes and increased clearing margin deposits. the increase in other revenues for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, is primarily due to the acquisition of nyse. other revenues exclude euronext and nyse technologies other revenues, which are included in income from discontinued operations. see "- discontinued operations" below.
transaction-based expenses our u.s. equities and options markets pay fees to the sec pursuant to section 31 of the exchange act. section 31 fees collected from customers are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. these section 31 fees are designed to recover the government's costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and securities professionals. we, in turn, collect activity assessment fees, which are included in transaction and clearing fees in our consolidated statements of income, from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the u.s. equities and options exchanges and recognize these amounts when invoiced. the activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the section 31 fees which are included in transaction-based expenses in our consolidated statements of income. as a result, activity assessment fees and section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income. activity assessment fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the sec is remitted semi-annually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. as of december 31, 2015, the accrued liability related to the un-remitted sec section 31 fees was $116 million.
we also incur liquidity payments made to cash and options trading customers and routing charges made to other exchanges that are included in transaction-based expenses. we incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our u.s. securities exchanges. in that case, we route the customer's order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. the external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. we record routing charges on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report, for more information on our revenue recognition policies.
operating expenses total operating expenses exclude operating expenses related to the discontinued operations. see "- discontinued operations" below. the majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our contract volume, except for certain technology and communication expenses and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our financial performance, as discussed below. the following table presents our operating expenses from continuing operations (dollars in millions):

we expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with the acquisitions of interactive data and trayport in december 2015 and growth of our business, and to vary from year to year based on the type and level of our acquisitions and other investments.
compensation and benefits expenses compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and the individual employee performance and the performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year to year based on our financial performance and by fluctuations in the number of employees.
compensation and benefits expenses increased for the last two years primarily due to increases in employee headcount. our employee headcount increased primarily due to the nyse, interactive data, trayport and superderivatives acquisitions, internal hiring relating to the nyse integration, converting contractor roles to employees at nyse, and hiring for clearing, technology, regulation and compliance. headcount increased from 1,077 employees at december 31, 2012 to 2,879 employees as of december 31, 2013 (excluding the euronext and nyse technologies employees), increased to 2,902 employees as of december 31, 2014, and increased to 5,549 employees as of december 31, 2015. as of december 31, 2015, our employees include 2,617 employees relating to the interactive data and trayport acquisitions and we recognized $17 million in compensation and benefits expenses relating to these acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions. the employee increases were partially offset by employee terminations during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 in connection with the integration of nyse, as discussed below.
non-cash compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated financial statements for employee stock options and restricted stock were $111 million, $82 million and $56 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increases in non-cash compensation expenses primarily relates to a greater number of employees receiving non-cash awards due to the headcount increases discussed above and the result of a greater restricted stock award value in the january 2015 annual award, primarily due to the issuance of more restricted stock awards to nyse employees than in the same period in the prior year, and due to the earlier grant date of the annual performance-based restricted stock award in 2015 as compared to 2014. we also increased our compensation accruals for our 2015 employee cash bonus and non-cash performance-based restricted shares above the target levels based on the 2015 financial performance as compared to our budget and financial performance targets as set by our board of directors.
we recorded $21 million, $99 million and $44 million in nyse employee severance costs during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, with such costs included in the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs discussed below and primarily related to nyse executive departures. in addition, we incurred non-acquisition related employee severance costs of $3 million, $4 million and $7 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the higher employee severance during 2013 primarily related to broker severance at creditex.
technology and communication expenses technology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology. these costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. communication expenses consist of costs for network connection for our electronic platforms, telecommunications costs, and fees paid for access to external market data. this expense also includes licensing and other fee agreement expenses which may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity
50
requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly.
we recognized $8 million in technology and communication expenses relating to interactive data and trayport during the year ended december 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions. technology and communication expenses increased for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily due to the inclusion of nyse expenses following our acquisition and growth in various contract volumes.
professional services expenses this expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor, as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees. this expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in consulting and technology services, temporary labor, and regulatory, accounting and legal proceedings.
professional services expenses decreased for year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to the reduction in professional services and contractors at nyse. we eliminated or replaced certain contractor positions with full time employees at nyse. this decrease was partially offset by $2 million in professional services expenses that we recognized relating to interactive data and trayport during the year ended december 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions.
professional services expenses increased for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily due to the inclusion of nyse expenses following our acquisition. professional services expenses also increased for the year ended december 31, 2014 due to costs incurred at ice futures singapore and ice clear singapore as we transitioned the exchange and clearing infrastructures to our trading and clearing platforms, and professional fees incurred for emir implementation. the increases in professional services expenses during the year ended december 31, 2014 were partially offset by decreases in professional services expenses during the fourth quarter of 2014 relating to a credit we received from finra and a reduction in expenses related to the termination of certain services agreements and related agreements, or slas, with euronext.
in connection with the euronext ipo, euronext and ice entered into a series of slas to ensure that euronext and ice (including liffe) had continuity in operating their respective businesses through the separation. the majority of the slas relating to euronext operational support and transition services provided to liffe until its transition to ice futures europe were terminated in november 2014.
rent and occupancy expenses this expense consists of costs related to leased and owned property including rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. we have significant operations located in and around atlanta, new york, london and boston with smaller offices located throughout the world. see item 2 "- properties" above for additional information regarding our leased and owned property.
rent and occupancy expenses decreased for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to consolidation of our new york, atlanta and london office locations. this decrease was partially offset by $1 million in rent and occupancy expenses that we recognized relating to interactive data and trayport during the year ended december 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions.
rent and occupancy expenses increased for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily due to the inclusion of nyse expenses following our acquisition. this increase was partially offset by $7 million in duplicate rent expenses and lease termination costs relating to the consolidation of multiple new york office locations that occurred during the year ended december 31, 2013.
acquisition-related transaction and integration costs we incurred $88 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily relating to our acquisitions of interactive data and trayport and the integration of nyse. of this amount, $46 million was primarily related to fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors and other external costs directly related to the interactive data and trayport acquisitions and to other transactions. we incurred $42 million for nyse integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs.
we incurred $129 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily relating to our acquisition and integration of nyse and the acquisitions of ice futures singapore, superderivatives, ice clear netherlands and true office. of this amount, $6 million was related to fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers,
51
accountants, tax advisors and public relations firms, and other external costs directly related to the transactions. the remaining $123 million was for nyse integration costs incurred during the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily relating to employee termination costs, costs incurred relating to the euronext ipo and sale, costs incurred relating to the sale of nyse technologies, and professional service costs.
we incurred $143 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily relating to our acquisition and integration of nyse and ice endex. of this amount, $97 million was related to fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors and public relations firms, and other external costs directly related to the transactions. the remaining $46 million was for nyse integration costs incurred during the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily relating to employee termination costs, costs incurred relating to the euronext ipo, deal-related bonuses and professional services costs.
we expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. as a result, we will incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods. see "- non-gaap financial measures" below.
selling, general and administrative expenses this expense relates to expenses from marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, bank service charges, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, certain expenses related to non-income related taxes and other general and administrative costs.
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased for the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to a reduction in certain expenses related to non-income related taxes, travel-related expenses and certain regulatory proceedings compared to the prior year period. this decrease was partially offset by $1 million in selling, general and administrative expenses that we recognized relating to interactive data and trayport during the year ended december 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily due to the inclusion of nyse expenses following our acquisition. selling, general and administrative expenses also increased for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily related to costs from our other acquisitions, due to an accrual made in anticipation of the outcome of certain regulatory proceedings, and increases in certain expenses related to non-income related taxes, travel and entertainment and insurance.
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, planes, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. this expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives, technology and the russell licensing rights. this expense also includes amortization of internally developed and purchased software over their estimated useful lives.
we recorded amortization expenses on the intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on the russell licensing agreement intangible assets, of $160 million, $151 million and $76 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increase during the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, is primarily relating to amortization expenses recorded on the interactive data and trayport intangible assets. we recognized $8 million in amortization expenses on the interactive data and trayport intangible assets during the year ended december 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions. the increase during the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, is primarily related to amortization expenses recorded on the nyse intangible assets, following our acquisition.
we recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $213 million, $182 million and $80 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increase during the year ended december 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, is primarily due to fixed asset additions and capitalized internally developed software, including additions relating to the nyse integration and real estate expenditures during 2015 and 2014 relating primarily to the atlanta, new york and london headquarters. the increase during the year ended december 31, 2015 is also due to the depreciation expenses recorded on the interactive data and trayport fixed assets. we recognized $2 million in depreciation expenses on the interactive data and trayport fixed assets during the year ended december 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions. the increase during the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, is primarily relating to depreciation expenses recorded on the nyse fixed assets. depreciation expenses also increased during the year ended december 31, 2014 due to additional depreciation
52
expenses recorded on increased fixed asset additions and capitalized internally developed software, including the building we purchased in atlanta, georgia in july 2013 and real estate expenditures during 2014 relating to the atlanta and new york headquarters. see "- cash flow - investing activities" below.

interest expense increased for the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily due to $9 million in interest expense that we recognized relating to new debt we incurred for the interactive data acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2015. this increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2015 was offset due to the repayment of $1.0 billion in nyse eur notes on june 30, 2015. the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, is primarily due to an increase in the overall amount of debt outstanding relating to debt incurred for and from the nyse acquisition. see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report, for additional information on our outstanding debt and debt facilities.
in october 2013, following the issuance of $1.4 billion in senior notes, we prepaid our outstanding private senior notes representing $400 million aggregate principal amount. in connection with the early payoff of the private senior notes, we incurred $51 million in expenses, which was recorded as other expense during the year ended december 31, 2013.
we account for our investment in cetip as an available-for-sale investment and it is classified as a long-term investment in our consolidated balance sheet. during the year ended december 31, 2013, we recorded an impairment of our cetip investment for $190 million, which was recorded as other expense. see note 5 to our consolidation financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report, for more information on this impairment. we recognized dividend income received relating to our cetip investment in other income, which was $16 million, $23 million and $8 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
in connection with our acquisition of nyse, we obtained a 40% ownership in occ and we recorded our investment in occ as an equity method investment. we recognized $6 million and $25 million in equity income related to this investment during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, as other income. for additional information on this investment and a discussion of the decrease in equity income for 2015 versus 2014, see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere is this annual report.
we recognized interest and investment income of $6 million, $7 million and $3 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. interest income is recorded in other income. the increases and decreases between periods relating to our interest income were primarily due to the interest income associated with the short-term euro-denominated term deposit investments discussed above.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we incurred $15 million in settlements and accruals for various outstanding legal matters (net of insurance proceeds), including for the atg/ats arbitration proceeding, which was recorded in other expense. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere is this annual report, for additional information on the atg/ats arbitration proceeding. during the year ended december 31, 2013, we incurred $3 million in settlements and accruals for various outstanding legal matters, which were recorded as other expense.
we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $14 million, $2 million and $2 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. foreign currency gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense) and relate to the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our foreign operations that are received in non-functional currencies due to the increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods. see

item 7 (a).     quantitative    and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk. we have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies.
interest rate risk we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments, and indebtedness. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments were $1.6 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, of which $448 million and $1.5 billion, respectively, were denominated in pounds sterling, euros or canadian dollars. of the $1.5 billion as of december 31, 2014, €969 million ($1.2 billion) represented euro-denominated cash that was placed in term deposits at various banks with a maturity date of june 25, 2015 that were used to repay the nyse eur notes on maturity at june 30, 2015. the decrease in the balances above as of december 31, 2015 was due to the use of the short-term euro-denominated term deposit investments to repay the nyse eur notes upon their maturity. the remaining cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments are denominated in u.s. dollars. we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. a hypothetical decrease in long-term interest rates to zero basis points would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $2 million as of december 31, 2015, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments.
our investment in cetip, which is recorded as an available-for-sale, long-term investment and is recorded and held in brazilian reais, was valued at $299 million as of december 31, 2015, including an accumulated unrealized loss of $25 million. changes in the fair value of the cetip investment are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income and do not impact earnings, except to the extent that unrealized losses are deemed to be other than temporary.
as of december 31, 2015, we had $7.3 billion in outstanding debt, of which $3.9 billion relates to senior notes and $852 million relates to the nyse notes, all of which bear interest at fixed interest rates. the remaining amount outstanding of $2.6 billion relates to the commercial paper program, which bears interest at fluctuating rates and, therefore, subjects us to interest rate risk. a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in long-term interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program as of december 31, 2015 would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $26 million, assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity. the interest rates on our commercial paper program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions. see item 7 "- management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - debt" included elsewhere in this annual report.

we have a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros. for the year ended december 31, 2015, 15% of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, and 12% of our consolidated expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros. as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly.
we have foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling or euros, due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. we had foreign currency transaction losses of $14 million, $2 million and $2 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the u.s. dollar, which strengthened. a 10% adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2015 would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of $7 million, assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity.
historically we have not entered into forward currency exchange rate contracts, and to the extent that our currency exposures are not hedged, exchange rate movements may cause fluctuations in our consolidated financial statements. accordingly, if there are adverse movements in exchange rates, our revenues may be lower and we may suffer significant losses, which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. although we may enter into hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure, these hedging arrangements may not be effective, particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our non-u.s. denominated assets and liabilities.
we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions):

as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from foreign currency translation was ($45 million) and $13 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2015, we had net exposure of pounds sterling and euro of £950 million ($1.4 billion) and €154 million ($168 million), respectively. based on these december 31, 2015 net currency positions, a hypothetical 10% decrease of pound sterling against u.s. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $141 million and a hypothetical 10% decrease of euro against u.s. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $17 million. for the year ended december 31, 2015, currency exchange rate differences had a negative impact of $58 million on our consolidated equity.
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default. we limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments and execute agreements. credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits depending on ratings assigned by rating agencies as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. we seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.
an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the status of counterparties. in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk.
clearing house cash deposit risks our clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member cash deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report, for more information about clearing house cash deposits, which were $51.2 billion as of december 31, 2015. while we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. as the clearing houses may pass on interest revenues (minus costs) to the members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions. the following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated.
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default. we limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we execute agreements and make investments. in addition, when a clearing house has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank, the clearing house utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures. credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits reflecting a number of factors including ratings assigned by rating agencies, cds spreads and internal ratings, as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. we seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring financial assets are placed with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.
an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties. in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) to avoid a concentration of risk.
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk a clearing house may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and the right time. to mitigate this risk, the clearing houses monitor liquidity requirements closely and maintain funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearing house to such funds and assets. for example, holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short term investments such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements serves to reduce liquidity risks.
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise causing the value of purchased securities to decline. if we were required to sell securities prior to maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale of the securities might be made at a loss relative to the latest market price. our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making short term investments of cash deposits. for example, where possible and in accordance with regulatory requirements, the clearing houses invest cash pursuant to overnight reverse repurchase agreements or term reverse repurchase agreements with short dated maturities. in addition, the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt (for example, u.s. treasury securities) and supranational debt instruments (euro cash deposits only) with short dated maturities.

security issuer risk security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on its payment when the security matures. this risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments under the reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign or government agency debt and limiting any direct investments to high quality sovereign debt instruments.
investment counterparty risk investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses. we mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality reverse repurchase agreement counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral under the repurchase agreement to high quality issuers. when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the underlying reverse repurchase securities in custody accounts under clearing house control. additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. the typical haircut received for high quality sovereign debt is 2% of the reverse repurchase amount. thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the reverse repurchase counterparty's obligation to the clearing house.
our clearing houses may use third party investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided to them by the clearing house. such investment advisors do not hold clearing member cash deposits or the underlying investments. clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control. clearing house property is held with credit worthy custodians including jpmorgan chase bank n.a., citibank n.a., bny mellon, bmo harris n.a. and euroclear bank brussels (for non-u.s. dollar deposits).
each clearing house employs (or may employ) multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single investment advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role, additional investment advisors or custodians are available as alternatives.
cross-currency margin deposit risk each of our clearing houses, pursuant to their rules, may permit posting of cross-currency collateral to satisfy margin requirements (for example, accepting margin deposits denominated in u.s. dollars to secure a euro margin obligation). the clearing houses mitigate the risk of a decline in currency value by applying a "haircut" to the currency posted as margin at a level sufficient to provide financial protection during periods of high currency volatility. cross-currency balances are marked-to-market on a daily basis. should the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value, the clearing member is required to increase its margin deposit on a same-day basis.
impact of inflation we have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant or to decline. in the event of inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of both maa and the operating partnership, of which maa is the sole general partner and in which maa owned a 94.8% limited partner interest as of december 31, 2015. maa conducts all of its business through the operating partnership and the operating partnership's various subsidiaries. this discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and that involves some degree of uncertainty. the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
we believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical.
acquisition of real estate assets we account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with asc 805-10, business combinations, which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and furniture, fixtures and equipment, and identified intangible assets, consisting of the value of in-place leases and other contracts. in calculating the fair value of acquired tangible assets, management divides forecasted net operating income (noi) by a market capitalization rate. management analyzed historical stabilized noi to determine its estimate for forecasted noi. management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similar sized markets. although management's estimates of the fair value of acquired tangible assets have been materially accurate in the past, variability of future operating performance as well as additional information becoming available could lead to the modification of the initial fair value calculation and purchase price allocation. subsequent adjustments made to the purchase price allocation, if any, would be made within the allocation period, which typically does not exceed one year.
impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill we account for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and evaluate our goodwill for impairment under accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets. we evaluate goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified. we periodically evaluate long-lived assets, including investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance, market conditions and legal factors. if impairment indicators exist for a long-lived asset, management compares the carrying amount of the asset to an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. management estimates future cash flows by analyzing historical cash flows generated by the asset. if impairment indicators exist for goodwill, management compares the carrying amount of the asset to an estimate of the implied fair value of the asset. management calculates the fair value of the asset by dividing historical operating cash flows by a market capitalization rate. management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similarly sized markets. historically, impairment analysis estimates have been materially accurate, which resulted in no impairment losses recognized during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013.
41
cost capitalization repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized. the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of the property to our standards are capitalized as incurred. the carrying costs related to development projects, including interest, property taxes, insurance and allocated direct development salary cost during the construction period, are capitalized. management uses judgment in determining whether costs should be expensed or capitalized.
loss contingencies the outcomes of claims, disputes and legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty. we record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. we review these accruals quarterly and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances. when a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the we do not accrue the loss. however, for material loss contingencies, if the unrecorded loss (or an additional loss in excess of the accrual) is at least a reasonable possibility and material, then we disclose a reasonable estimate of the possible loss, or range of loss, if such reasonable estimate can be made. if we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss, or range of loss, then that is disclosed.
the assessment of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or range of loss is reasonably estimable, often involve a series of complex judgments about future events. among the factors that we consider in this assessment, including with respect to the matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10-k, are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims, the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency (if reasonably estimable), the progress of the matter, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, our experience in similar matters, the facts available to us at the time of assessment, and how we intend to respond, or have responded, to the proceeding or claim. our assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress. for matters where we are not currently able to reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, the factors that have contributed to this determination include the following: (i) the damages sought are indeterminate; (ii) the proceedings are in the early stages; (iii) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories or a large or uncertain number of actual or potential cases or parties; and/or (iv) discussions with the parties in matters that are expected ultimately to be resolved through negotiation and settlement have not reached the point where we believe a reasonable estimate of loss, or range of loss, can be made. in such instances, we believe that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss or business impact, if any.

overview of the year ended december 31, 2015
we experienced an increase in income from continuing operations in 2015 as increases in revenues outpaced increases in expenses. the increases in revenues came from a 6.3% increase in our large market same store segment, a 4.7% increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 1.0% increase in our non-same store and other segment. the increase in expense came from a 3.6% increase in our large market same store segment and a 3.2% increase in our secondary market same store segment, which were offset slightly by an 8.0% decrease in our non-same store and other segment. our same store portfolio represents those communities that have been held and have been stabilized for at least twelve months. communities excluded from the same store portfolio include recent acquisitions, communities being developed or in lease-up, communities undergoing extensive renovations, and communities identified for disposition. additional information regarding the composition of operating segments is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, note 16 - segment information. the drivers of these increases are discussed below in the results of operations section.
on october 1, 2013, we consummated the merger and acquired all of colonial's net assets. as a result of the merger, the results of operations for 2013 include three months of results for the legacy colonial portfolio. the results of operations for 2014 and 2015 include twelve months of results for the legacy colonial portfolio.
we have grown externally during the past three years by following our acquisition strategy to invest in large and mid-sized growing markets in the southeast and southwest region of the united states. apart from the merger, we acquired four apartment communities for our portfolio in 2013, eight in 2014 and seven in 2015. offsetting some of this increased revenue stream were nine apartment community dispositions in 2013, eight in 2014, and 21 in 2015.

the following table shows our apartment real estate assets as of december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013:

average effective monthly rent/unit, excluding lease-up and development      $1,006                $948                $883
occupancy, excluding lease-up and development                                  95.6   %            94.1   %            94.9   %
average effective monthly rent per unit is calculated as the average of monthly gross rent amounts for occupied units, after the effect of leasing concessions, plus then-prevailing market rates asked for unoccupied units, divided by the total number of units. leasing concessions represent discounts to the current market rate. we believe average effective monthly rent is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing; however, it does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit. for additional discussion of same store average rent per unit and occupancy comparisons, see the "trends" section below.
in addition to the multifamily assets detailed above, we also owned an interest in two commercial properties totaling approximately 238,000 square feet of leasable space.

the increase in property operating expenses from our large market same store group is primarily the result of increases in real estate taxes of $3.2 million, personnel expenses of $1.9 million, water expenses of approximately $1.0 million, cable expenses of $0.5 million, and waste removal expenses of $0.2 million. the increase in property operating expenses from our secondary market same store group is primarily a result of increases in other operating expenses of $1.5 million, real estate taxes of $1.1 million, and personnel expenses of $1.2 million. the decrease in property operating expenses from our non-same store and other group is primarily the result of decreases in personnel expenses of $2.4 million and utility expenses of $1.7 million.
depreciation and amortization the following table shows our depreciation and amortization expense by segment for the years ended december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 (dollars in thousands):

the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to a decrease of $19.4 million related to the amortization of the fair value of in-place leases and resident relationships acquired as a result of the merger from the year ended december 31, 2014 to the year ended december 31, 2015. this decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense of $11.7 million driven by an increase in gross real estate assets from the year ended december 31, 2014 to the year ended december 31, 2015.
property management expenses property management expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015 were approximately $31.0 million, a decrease of $1.1 million from the year ended december 31, 2014. the majority of the decrease was related to a decrease in state franchise taxes of $2.1 million, partially offset by an increase in insurance expense of $0.6 million, an increase in payroll expense of $0.3 million, and an increase in incentive expense $0.3 million.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015 were approximately $25.7 million, an increase of $4.8 million from the year ended december 31, 2014. the majority of the increase was related to increases in legal fees of $2.7 million and stock option expenses of $1.6 million.
44
merger and integration related expenses there were no merger or integration related expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015, as these expenses related primarily to severance, legal, professional, temporary systems, staffing, and facilities costs incurred for the acquisition and integration of colonial. for the year ended december 31, 2014, merger and integration related expenses were approximately $3.2 million and $8.4 million, respectively.
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2015 was approximately $122.3 million, a decrease of $1.6 million from the year ended december 31, 2014. the decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in amortization of deferred financing cost from the year ended december 31, 2014 to the year ended december 31, 2015 of approximately $0.9 million. also, the overall debt balance decreased from $3.5 billion to $3.4 billion, a decrease of $85.1 million. the average effective interest rate remained at 3.7% and the average years to rate maturity increased from 4.4 years to 4.8 years.
dispositions of depreciable real estate assets excluded from discontinued operations we recorded a gain on sale of depreciable assets excluded from discontinued operations of $190.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $147.3 million from the $42.6 million gain on sale of depreciable assets recorded for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was primarily the result of increased disposition activity. dispositions increased from eight multifamily properties for the year ended december 31, 2014, to 21 multifamily properties for the year ended december 31, 2015.
gain from real estate joint ventures we recorded a gain from real estate joint ventures of $6.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2014 as opposed to no material gain or loss being recorded during the year ended december 31, 2015. the decrease was primarily a result of recording a $3.4 million gain for the disposition of ansley village by mid-america multifamily fund ii, or fund ii, as well as a $2.8 million gain for the promote fee received from our fund ii partner during 2014. the promote fee was received as a result of maa achieving certain performance metrics in its management of the fund ii properties over the life of the joint venture. there were no such gains recorded during the year ended december 31, 2015.
discontinued operations we recorded a gain on sale of discontinued operations of $5.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. we did not record a gain or loss on sale of discontinued operations during the year ended december 31, 2015, due to the adoption of asu 2014-08, reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity, which resulted in dispositions being included in the gain on sale of depreciable real estate assets excluded from discontinued operations and is discussed further below.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31, 2015 was approximately $18.5 million, an increase of $10.2 million from the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase is consistent with the increase to overall net income and is primarily a result of the items discussed above.
net income attributable to maa primarily as a result of the items discussed above, net income attributable to maa increased by approximately $184.3 million in the year ended december 31, 2015 from the year ended december 31, 2014.
comparison of the year ended december 31, 2014 to the year ended december 31, 2013
the comparison of the year ended december 31, 2014 to the year ended december 31, 2013 shows the segment break down based on the 2014 same store portfolios. a comparison using the 2015 same store portfolio would not be comparative due to the nature of the classifications as a result of the merger.

the increase in property revenues from our same store portfolio is primarily a result of increased average effective rent per unit of 4.3% for our large market and 1.9% for our secondary markets. the increase in property revenues from our non-same store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the colonial portfolio as a result of the merger, which represents $275.6 million of the increase. the remaining $66.6 million of the increase was related to acquisitions other than the merger.

the increase in property operating expenses from our same store portfolio is primarily a result of increases in real estate taxes of $3.9 million and utilities expenses of $1.3 million, offset by a decrease in insurance expenses of $1.0 million. the increase in property operating expenses from our non-same store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the colonial portfolio as a result of the merger, which represents $107.6 million of the increase. the remaining $27.4 million of the increase was related to acquisitions other than the merger.

the increase in depreciation and amortization expense from our same store portfolio resulted from asset additions made during the normal course of business. the increase in depreciation and amortization expense from our non-same store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the colonial portfolio as a result of the merger.
property management expenses property management expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014 were approximately $32.1 million, an increase of $9.0 million from the year ended december 31, 2013. the majority of the increase was related to increases in payroll expenses of $3.0 million, state franchise taxes of $2.7 million, software maintenance of $2.1 million, and incentive bonuses of $0.9 million as a result of the increased headcount and scope of work resulting from the merger.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expense for the year ended december 31, 2014 was approximately $20.9 million, an increase of $5.3 million from the year ended december 31, 2013. the majority of the increase was related to increases in incentive bonuses of $3.3 million and payroll expenses of $1.2 million as a result of the merger.
merger and integration related expenses merger related expenses, primarily severance, legal, and professional costs for the acquisition of colonial were approximately $3.2 million from the year ended december 31, 2014, a decrease of $29.3 million from the year ended december 31, 2013. we also incurred integration related expenses, primarily related to temporary systems, staffing, and facilities costs of $8.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase of $3.3 million from the year ended december 31, 2013.
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2014 was approximately $124.0 million, an increase of $45.0 million from the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily the result of an increase in our average debt outstanding from the year ended december 31, 2013 to the year ended december 31, 2014 of approximately $1.38 billion, due primarily to the assumption of colonial's debt as a result of the merger.
debt extinguishment loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended december 31, 2014 was approximately $2.6 million, an increase of -$2.2 million from the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily the result of the prepayment of a loan for a property sold during the year ended december 31, 2014.
discontinued operations we recorded a gain on sale of discontinued operations of $5.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to a $76.8 million gain for the year ended december 31, 2013. the decrease in the gain is caused by the proceeds received in 2014 being less than the proceeds received in 2013 in relation to the net book value of the properties sold and, in accordance with newly adopted asu 2014-08, recording a gain on sale of depreciable assets excluded from discontinued operations in 2014, which is discussed further below.
dispositions of depreciable real estate assets excluded from discontinued operations we recorded a gain on sale of depreciable assets excluded from discontinued operations of $42.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. we did not record a similar gain for the year ended december 31, 2013 because we did not dispose of any properties that were excluded from discontinued operations.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31, 2014 was approximately $8.3 million, an increase of $4.3 million from the year ended december 31, 2013.

net income attributable to maa primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income attributable to maa increased by approximately $32.7 million in the year ended december 31, 2014 from the year ended december 31, 2013.
funds from operations funds from operations, or ffo, a non-gaap financial measure, represents net income (computed in accordance with gaap) excluding extraordinary items, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, asset impairment, gains or losses on disposition of real estate assets, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate, and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis. disposition of real estate assets includes, but is not limited to, sales of discontinued operations.
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income, or any other gaap measurement of performance, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. management believes that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance primarily because its calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets. we believe that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. our calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other reits.
core ffo, a non-gaap financial measure, represents ffo excluding certain non-cash or non-routine items such as acquisition, merger and integration expenses, mark-to-market debt adjustments and loss or gain on debt extinguishment. while our definition of core ffo is similar to others in our industry, our precise methodology for calculating core ffo may differ from that utilized by other reits and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other reits. core ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. management believes that core ffo is helpful in understanding our operating performance in that it removes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance.

ffo for the year ended december 31, 2015 increased approximately $48.3 million from the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of $50.6 million and a decrease in merger and integration related expenses of $11.5 million, which were partially offset by increases of $7.3 million in property operating expenses and $4.8 million in general and administrative expenses.
ffo for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased approximately $173.1 million from the year ended december 31, 2013 primarily as a result of the increase in property revenues of $357.3 million that was partially offset by the $139.7 million increase in property operating expenses and the $45.0 million of increased interest expense.
core ffo for the year ended december 31, 2015 increased approximately $42.9 million from the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of $50.6 million and the decrease in interest expense, excluding the mark-to-market debt adjustment, of $6.7 million, which was partially offset by the $7.3 million increase in property operating expenses and the $4.8 million in general and administrative expenses.
core ffo for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased by approximately $133.4 million from the year ended december 31, 2013 primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of $357.3 million discussed above that was partially offset by the $139.7 million increase in property operating expenses and the $45.0 million of increased interest expense.
trends during the twelve months ended december 31, 2015, demand for apartments was strong, as it was during the twelve months ended december 31, 2014. this strength was evident on two fronts: occupancy and effective rent per unit. same store
49
physical occupancy ended 2015 at 96.5% and average physical occupancy for the same store portfolio was 96.1% for the year. same store effective rent per unit continued to grow, up 4.4% in the twelve months ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2014. this compares to 3.3% growth achieved in the twelve months ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2013.
an important part of our portfolio strategy is maintaining a broad diversity of markets across the southeast and southwest regions of the united states. the diversity of markets tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area. we believe that a well-diversified portfolio, including both large and select secondary markets, will perform well in "up" cycles as well as weather "down" cycles better. as of december 31, 2015, we were invested in approximately 40 defined metropolitan statistical areas, with approximately 65% of our multifamily assets, based on gross assets, in large markets and 35% of our multifamily assets in select secondary markets.
new supply of rental units has increased in several of our key markets and multifamily permitting increased in 2015 as compared to 2014. we believe this permitting will ultimately lead to a further increase in supply but also believe the lack of new apartments in recent years combined with demand from new households will help keep supply and demand in balance in most markets. also, we believe that more disciplined credit terms for residential mortgages should continue to favor rental demand at existing multi-family properties. furthermore, rental competition from single family homes has not been a major competitive factor impacting our portfolio. in 2015, move outs attributable to single family rentals remained relatively consistent with prior years. we have seen significant rental competition from single family homes in only a few of our submarkets. long term, we expect demographic trends (including the growth of prime age groups for rentals and immigration and population movement to the southeast and southwest) will continue to build apartment rental demand for our markets.
our focus is on maintaining strong physical occupancy while increasing pricing where possible through our revenue management system. as noted above, physical occupancy ended 2015 strong and also averaged 75 basis points higher in 2015 as compared to 2014. as we continue through the typically slower winter leasing season, the current level of physical occupancy puts us in a good position to maximize pricing in the first quarter of 2016.
we continue to develop improved products, operating systems and procedures that we believe enable us to capture more revenues. the continued benefit of ancillary services (such as our cable saver and deposit saver programs), improved collections and utility reimbursements enable us to capture increased revenue. we also actively work on improving processes and products to reduce expenses, such as new web-sites and internet access for our residents that enable them to transact their business with us more simply and effectively.
liquidity and capital resources our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as well as general economic and market conditions, are the principal factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources. the significant changes in cash from the year ended december 31, 2014 to the year ended december 31, 2015 due to operating, investing, and financing activities are as follows:
operating activities net cash flow provided by operating activities increased to $463.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 from $385.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. this change was a result of various items, including higher revenues, as discussed above.

investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased to $136.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 from $203.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the primary drivers of this change are as follows:

the increase in cash outflows from purchases of real estate and other assets primarily resulted from the acquisition of seven apartment communities and three land acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the acquisition of eight apartment communities and no land acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2014. additionally, the apartment communities acquired during the year ended december 31, 2014 included debt assumptions, which reduced the amount of cash paid for these properties. the increase in proceeds from disposition of real estate assets primarily resulted from the sale of 21 apartment communities, one commercial property, and one land parcel during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the sale of eight apartment communities, two commercial properties, and six land parcels during the year ended december 31, 2014. the decrease in distributions from real estate joint ventures primarily resulted from the receipt of funds from the sale of two joint venture properties during the year ended december 31, 2014. no joint venture properties were sold during 2015. the decrease in cash inflows from the funding of escrow for future acquisitions resulted from the funding of two 1031(b) transactions during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the funding of three 1031(b) transactions and the return of escrow related to two 1031(b) transactions during the year ended december 31, 2014. the decrease in cash outflows for development resulted from the timing of development spending for two projects commencing during the year ended december 31, 2015.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities increased to $316.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 from $244.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the primary drivers of this change are as follows:

the increase in cash outflows from the net change in credit lines from 2014 to 2015 was due to the timing of borrowings and repayments on our various lines of credit. the increase in cash outflows from principal payments on notes payable is primarily due to the fact that during 2015 we paid off the principal balance due on unsecured public bond notes payable originally issued by colonial that matured during the year. the decrease in cash inflows from the exercise of stock options resulted from the exercise of approximately 7,000 stock options during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the exercise of approximately 270,000 stock options during the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase in cash outflows
51
from dividends paid on common shares primarily resulted from the increase in the dividend rate to $0.77 per share during the year ended december 31, 2015 from $0.73 per share during the year ended december 31, 2014.
equity as of december 31, 2015, maa owned 75,408,571 op units, comprising a 94.8% limited partnership interest in the operating partnership, while the remaining 4,162,996 outstanding op units were held by limited partners of the operating partnership. holders of op units (other than maa and its corporate affiliates) may require us to redeem their op units from time to time, in which case we may, at our option, pay the redemption price either in cash (in an amount per op unit equal, in general, to the average closing price of maa's common stock on the new york stock exchange over a specified period prior to the redemption date) or by delivering one share of our common stock (subject to adjustment under specified circumstances) for each op unit so redeemed. in addition, we have registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, the 4,162,996 shares of our common stock, which as of december 31, 2015, were issuable upon redemption of op units held by the operating partnership's limited partners so that those shares can be sold freely in the public markets. to the extent that additional op units are issued to limited partners of the operating partnership, we will likely register the additional shares of common stock issuable upon redemption of those op units under the securities act of 1933, as amended, so that those shares can also be sold in the public markets. if maa issues shares of common stock upon the redemption of op units in the operating partnership, sales of substantial amounts of such shares of common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for maa common stock or may impair maa's ability to raise capital through the sale of common stock or other equity securities.
in connection with the merger, we issued approximately 31.9 million shares of maa common stock and approximately 2.6 million op units on october 1, 2013.

unsecured credit facility on october 15, 2015, our operating partnership entered into a $750.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility agreement with keybank national association and fourteen other banks. this credit facility replaced our operating partnership's previous unsecured credit facility with keybank. interest rate is determined using an investment grade pricing grid using libor plus a spread of 0.85% to 1.55%. as of december 31, 2015, we had $75.0 million borrowed under this
53
facility. this facility serves as our primary source of short-term liquidity and has an accordion feature that we may use to expand its capacity to $1.5 billion.
unsecured term loans in addition to our unsecured credit facility, we maintain three unsecured term loans. we had total borrowings of $550.0 million outstanding under these term loan agreements at december 31, 2015.
the $250.0 million wells fargo term loan bears interest at a rate of libor plus a spread of 0.90% to 1.90% based on the credit ratings of our unsecured debt. the loan matures on august 1, 2018. as of december 31, 2015, this loan was bearing interest at a rate of libor plus 1.15%.
the $150.0 million u.s. bank term loan bears interest at a rate of libor plus a spread of 0.90% to 1.90% based on the credit ratings of our unsecured debt. the loan matures on march 1, 2020. as of december 31, 2015, this loan was bearing interest at a rate of libor plus 1.15%.
the $150.0 million term loan agreement with key bank bears interest at a rate of libor plus a spread of 0.90% to 1.75% based on the credit ratings of our unsecured debt. the loan matures on march 1, 2021. as of december 31, 2015, this loan was bearing interest at a rate of libor plus 1.10%.
senior unsecured notes we have also issued public and private unsecured notes.  as of december 31, 2015, we have approximately $1.2 billion of publicly issued bonds and $310 million of private placement notes.  in october 2013 we issued $350.0 million senior notes due 2023 with a coupon of 4.30%, paid semi-annually on april 15 and october 15.   in june 2014 we issued $400.0 million senior notes due 2024 with a coupon of 3.75%, paid semi-annually on june 15 and december 15.  in november 2015 we issued $400.0 million senior notes due 2025 with a coupon of 4.00%, paid semi-annually on may 15 and november 15.  we also assumed approximately $75.3 million in senior notes as part of the colonial merger.  as of december 31, 2015 all of these amounts remained outstanding.
on july 29, 2011, we issued $135.0 million of senior unsecured notes. the notes were offered in a private placement with three maturity tranches: $50.0 million at 4.7% maturing on july 29, 2018, $72.8 million at 5.4% maturing on july 29, 2021; and $12.3 million at 5.6% maturing on july 29, 2023; all of which is outstanding at december 31, 2015.
on august 31, 2012, we issued $175 million of senior unsecured notes. the notes were offered in a private placement with four tranches: $18.0 million at 3.15% maturing on november 30, 2017; $20.0 million at 3.61% maturing on november 30, 2019; $117.0 million at 4.17% maturing on november 30, 2022; and $20.0 million at 4.33% maturing on november 30, 2024, all of which is outstanding at december 31, 2015.
secured credit facilities we rely on the efficient operation of the financial markets to refinance debt maturities, and on rate renewals for fannie mae. fannie mae provided credit enhancement for approximately $240.0 million of our outstanding debt through our fannie mae facilities, as defined below, as of december 31, 2015.
the interest rate markets for fannie mae discount mortgage backed securities, or dmbs, which in our experience are highly liquid and highly correlated with three-month libor interest rates, are also an important component of our liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness. prudential mortgage capital, a delegated underwriting and servicing, or dus, lender for fannie mae, markets 90-day fannie mae dmbs monthly, and is obligated to advance funds to us at dmbs rates plus a credit spread under the terms of the credit agreements between prudential and us.
approximately 7.0% of our outstanding obligations at december 31, 2015 were borrowed through a credit facility credit enhanced by fannie mae, which we also refer to as the fannie mae facility. the fannie mae facility has line limit of $240.0 million, of which $240.0 million was collateralized, available to borrow, and borrowed, at december 31, 2015. various fannie mae rate tranches of the fannie mae facility mature from 2016 through 2018. the fannie mae facility provides for both fixed and variable rate borrowings. the interest rate on the majority of the variable portion is based on the fannie mae dmbs rate which are credit-enhanced by fannie mae and are typically sold every 90 days by prudential mortgage capital at interest rates approximating three-month london interbank offered rate, or libor, less a spread that has averaged 0.17%
54
over the life of the fannie mae facility, plus a credit enhancement fee of 0.62%. we have seen more volatility in the spread between the dmbs and three-month libor since late 2007 than was historically prevalent.
secured property mortgages we also maintain secured property mortgages with fannie mae, freddie mac, and various life insurance companies. these mortgages are usually fixed rate and can range from 5 to 10 years in maturity. as of december 31, 2015, we have $1.0 billion of secured property mortgages.

off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2015, and 2014, we did not have any relationships, including those with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
in addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. as such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. we do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with us or our related parties other than those disclosed in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements, note 14.
as of december 31, 2015, we had a 25.0% ownership interest in the mckinney joint venture, which consists of undeveloped land.
as of december 31, 2015, we had a 33.3% ownership interest in the land title building joint venture, which consists of 29,971 square feet of commercial space.
our investments in our real estate joint ventures are unconsolidated and are recorded using the equity method for the joint ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest.
insurance we renegotiated our primary insurance programs effective july 1, 2015. we believe that the property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that

any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would not have a significant impact on our liquidity, financial position or results of operation.
inflation our resident leases at the apartment communities allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder, and thus may enable us to seek rent increases. almost all leases are for one year or less. the short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation.

impact of recently issued accounting standards the following table provides a brief description of recent accounting pronouncements that could have a material effect on our financial statements:
standard                                                                                                 description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           date of adoption                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       effect on the financial statements or other significant matters accounting standards update (asu) 2015-03 and asu 2015-15, interest -imputation of interest              asu 2015-03, requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums. asu 2015-15 provides additional guidance to asu 2015-03, which did not address presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. asu 2015-15 noted that the sec staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.   this asu is effective for annual periods ending after december 15, 2015; however, early adoption is permitted.                                                                                                                                                                         we adopted this asu on december 31, 2015. the adoption of this asu resulted in the reclassification of $13.3 million and $11.8 million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the company's secured property mortgages, senior unsecured notes, and unsecured term loans from deferred financing costs, net to a reduction in unsecured and secured notes payable within its consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
asu 2014-15, disclosure of uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern        this asu requires an entity's management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. if substantial doubt exists, the entity must disclose the principal conditions or events that raised the substantial doubt, management's evaluation of the significance of these conditions, and management's plan for alleviating the substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.                                                                                                                         this asu is effective for annual periods ending after december 15, 2016; however, early adoption is permitted.                                                                                                                                                                         we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of this asu, but do not expect the adoption of this asu to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations taken as a whole.
asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers                                                       this asu establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         this asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017, as a result of a deferral of the effective date arising from the issuance of asu 2015-14, revenue from contracts with customers - deferral of the effective date. early adoption is permitted.   the amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this asu on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations taken as a whole and plan on completing this assessment in the fourth quarter of 2016, but we do not expect the impact to be material. we have not yet determined which method will be used for initial application.
asu 2014-08, reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity   this asu raises the threshold for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations. it also requires additional disclosures for discontinued operations and new disclosures for individually material disposal transactions that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               this asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years; however, early adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of 2014.                                                                                         we adopted this asu on january 1, 2014. the adoption of this asu required us to not classify certain disposals occurring during 2014 as discontinued operations. the 2014 dispositions did not qualify for discontinued operations treatment and therefore the gains on these properties are presented as a component of continuing operations for 2014.

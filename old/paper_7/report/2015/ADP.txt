during the twelve months ended june 30, 2015 ("fiscal 2015"), we more narrowly focused our attention on our global hcm strategy and our results continue to reflect the strength of our underlying business model and our success in the market. the increased focus is evidenced by the separation of our former dealer services business into its own independent, publicly traded company called cdk global, inc. ("cdk") on september 30, 2014 and our investments in product innovation and our salesforce. our increased focus on product development, the high demand for additional hcm solutions, including products that assist businesses in complying with the affordable care act ("aca"), improved productivity, and an improving economic backdrop in the united states of america ("u.s."), led our salesforce to deliver exceptionally strong new business bookings, which represent annualized recurring revenues anticipated from sales orders to new and existing clients in employer services and professional employer organization ("peo") services. we are pleased with the financial performance of our business segments which have driven solid organic revenue growth and pretax margin expansion. this was achieved despite pressure on employer services revenues from foreign currency translation, margin pressure from our high-margin client funds interest revenue (which grew at a slower rate than overall revenue), and increased selling expenses which were driven by an exceptionally strong new business booking performance. revenue retention remains at record levels and we continue to benefit from the strength of the pays per control in our client base, which we measure as the number of employees on our clients' payrolls as measured on a same-store-sales basis utilizing a representative subset of payrolls ranging from small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of the u.s. geographic regions.
consolidated revenues in fiscal 2015 increased 7%, to $10,938.5 million, as compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 ("fiscal 2014"). earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 10%, to $2,070.7 million, as compared to fiscal 2014 and net earnings from continuing operations increased 11%, to $1,376.5 million, as compared to fiscal 2014. our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 12% to $2.89 in fiscal 2015, as compared to $2.57 in fiscal 2014.
despite pressure from foreign currency translation and higher selling expenses to support our exceptionally strong new business bookings in our employer services segment, our business segment results were solid. employer services' revenues increased 5% to $8,897.3 million and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 7% to $2,694.2 million. peo services' revenues increasing 17% to $2,647.2 million and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 30% to $303.6 million in fiscal 2015. total new business bookings grew 13% worldwide to over $1.6 billion in fiscal 2015. our key business metrics continue to reflect the core strength of our business model, with our employer services' worldwide client revenue retention rate remaining strong at 91.4% and our pays per control increasing 3.0% in fiscal 2015.
although interest on funds held for clients increased for the first time in seven years, to $377.7 million in fiscal 2015 from $373.4 million in fiscal 2014, we still felt the pressure from declining interest rates on our client funds investment portfolio. this decline in the average interest rate earned to 1.7% in fiscal 2015, as compared to 1.8% in fiscal 2014, was more than offset by growth in average client funds balances of 5% resulting from the continued strength and growth of our employer services segment.
we invest our funds held for clients in accordance with adp's prudent and conservative investment guidelines, where the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification are the foremost objectives of our investment strategy. the portfolio is predominantly invested in aaa/aa rated fixed-income securities. our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio).  this investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations.
our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid at june 30, 2015, with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.7 billion. our net cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,905.6 million in fiscal 2015, as compared to $1,821.4 million in fiscal 2014. this increase in cash flows provided by operating activities from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 was due to the sale of notes receivable related to our dealer services financing arrangements and lower pension contributions. the change in cash used in investing activities of $4,573.6 million is due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of restricted cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations, partially offset by the receipt of an $825.0 million tax-free dividend received from cdk in connection with the spin-off earlier this fiscal year. the increase in cash provided by financing activities of $3,974.9 million is primarily due to the net change in client fund obligations, partially offset by the timing of cash received and repaid under our commercial paper issuances and an increase in repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2015.
we have a strong business model with a high percentage of recurring revenues with strong client retention, good margins, the ability to generate consistent, healthy cash flows, and low capital expenditure requirements. we continue to enhance value to our shareholders, and in fiscal 2015 paid dividends of $927.6 million and returned $1,557.2 million in cash through our share buyback program. these share repurchases were partially funded by the $825.0 million dividend we received
20
from cdk earlier this fiscal year. in the last five fiscal years, we have reduced our common stock outstanding by approximately 5% through share buybacks, net of the effect of common stock issued under employee stock-based compensation programs. we have also raised the quarterly dividend per share for 40 consecutive years.

other income, net in fiscal 2015 includes a $1.4 million gain on the sale of notes receivable related to our dealer services financing agreements. the increase in interest income on corporate funds resulted from higher average daily corporate funds, which increased from $4.1 billion in fiscal 2014 to $4.6 billion in fiscal 2015, partially offset by lower average interest rates of 1.3% in fiscal 2015 as compared to 1.4% in fiscal 2014.

provision for income taxes the effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 and 2014 was 33.5% and 33.9%, respectively. the decrease in the effective tax rate was due to adjustments to the tax liability, the usage of foreign tax credits in a planned repatriation of foreign earnings, and a change in the tax law during fiscal 2015, partially offset by the resolution of certain tax matters during fiscal 2014.
net earnings from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations net earnings from continuing operations increased 11% on higher earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and a lower effective tax rate, as described above. net earnings from continuing operations growth was unfavorably impacted one percentage point by foreign currency translation in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 12% to $2.89 in fiscal 2015, as compared to $2.57 in fiscal 2014. diluted earnings per share growth was unfavorably impacted $0.04 due to foreign currency translation in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014.
in fiscal 2015, our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations reflects the increase in net earnings from continuing operations and the impact of fewer shares outstanding, resulting from the repurchase of approximately 18.2 million shares in fiscal 2015 and 9.0 million shares in fiscal 2014, partially offset by the issuances of shares under our stock-based compensation programs.

other income, net, decreased $24.2 million in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013.  the decrease was due to a decrease in realized gains on available-for-sale securities of $11.7 million and a decrease in interest income on corporate funds of $9.2 million in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013.  the decrease in interest income on corporate funds resulted from lower average interest rates of 1.5% in fiscal 2013 to 1.4% in fiscal 2014 and lower average daily corporate funds, which decreased from $4.2 billion in fiscal 2013 to $4.1 billion in fiscal 2014. in addition, we recognized gains of $2.2 million pertaining to the sale of two buildings during fiscal 2013.

earnings from continuing operations before income taxes earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $169.1 million, or 10%, to $1,879.2 million in fiscal 2014 compared to $1,710.1 million in fiscal 2013, which includes the effect of the $42.7 million goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2013. overall margin increased approximately 30 basis points from 18.1% in fiscal 2013 to 18.4% in fiscal 2014. this increase was due to margin improvements in our business segments, partially offset by approximately 80 basis points of margin decline related to the continued decline in interest on funds held for clients discussed above and 30 basis points of margin decline due to increased stock-based compensation costs. overall margin in fiscal 2014 also benefited approximately 50 basis points from the $42.7 million goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2013.
adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $126.4 million, or 7%, to $1,879.2 million in fiscal 2014, as compared to $1,752.8 million for fiscal 2013 due to increased revenue and margin improvement in our business segments, partially offset by the continued decline in interest on funds held for clients. margin, adjusted for the the fiscal 2013 goodwill impairment charge related to our adp advancedmd business, decreased 20 basis points from 18.6% to 18.4%. margin improvements in our business segments were offset primarily by approximately 80 basis points of margin decrease related to the continued decline in interest on fund held for clients discussed above and 30 basis points of margin decline due to increased stock-based compensation costs.
provision for income taxes the effective tax rates in fiscal 2014 and 2013 were 33.9% and 34.4%, respectively. our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 includes the effect of a non tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge of $42.7 million that increased our effective tax rate by 0.8 percentage points percentage points in the period. the remaining increase is due to an increase in foreign taxes and reduced foreign tax credits available, partially offset by the resolution of certain tax matters.
net earnings from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations net earnings from continuing operations increased $120.4 million, or 11%, to $1,242.6 million in fiscal 2014, compared to $1,122.2 million in fiscal 2013, which includes the effect of the $42.7 million goodwill impairment charge. diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.57 in fiscal 2014, as compared to $2.30 in fiscal 2013.
in fiscal 2014, our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations reflects the increase in net earnings from continuing operations and the impact of fewer shares outstanding resulting from the net impact of cumulative share repurchases, offset by the issuances of shares under our stock-based compensation programs.
adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased $77.7 million, or 7%, to $1,242.6 million, in fiscal 2014, as compared to $1,164.9 million for fiscal 2013, and the adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 8%, to $2.57 for fiscal 2014, compared to $2.39 for fiscal 2013. the increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2014 reflects the increase in adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and the impact of fewer shares outstanding resulting from the net impact of cumulative share repurchases, offset by the issuances of shares under our stock-based compensation programs.

employer services fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014
revenues from continuing operations employer services' revenues from continuing operations increased 5% due to new business started during the year from new business bookings growth, an increase in the number of employees on our clients' payrolls, and the impact of price increases.  during fiscal 2015, employer services' revenue growth was negatively impacted two percentage points by unfavorable foreign currency translation. our worldwide client revenue retention rate remained at a record level of 91.4% in fiscal 2015 when compared to fiscal 2014 and our u.s. pays per control increased 3.0% in fiscal 2015.
26
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes employer services' earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 7% due to the increase in revenues from continuing operations of $391.3 million discussed above, partially offset by an increase in expenses of $214.4 million. this growth includes an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of one percentage point.  expenses increased in fiscal 2015, as compared to 2014, due to labor-related costs to support our growing revenues and an increase in selling expenses as we experienced traction from our increased focus on product development, high demand for additional hcm solutions, including products that assist businesses in complying with the aca, improved productivity, and an improving economic backdrop in the u.s. overall margin increased approximately 70 basis points from 29.6% to 30.3% in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, due to our operating costs related to servicing our clients increasing at a slower rate than our revenues, partially offset by an increase in selling expense due to higher new business bookings.
fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013

other the primary components of the "other" segment are the results of operations of adp indemnity, non-recurring gains and losses, miscellaneous processing services, such as customer financing transactions, the elimination of intercompany transactions, and certain charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, such as stock-based compensation expense and the fiscal 2013 goodwill impairment charge.
stock-based compensation expense was $143.2 million, $117.1 million, and $82.0 million in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
adp indemnity provides workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for peo services worksite employees up to $1 million per occurrence. peo services has secured specific per occurrence and aggregate stop loss insurance from a wholly-owned and regulated insurance carrier of aig that covers all losses in excess of $1 million per occurrence and also any aggregate losses within the $1 million retention that collectively exceed a certain level in certain policy years. we utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability for the peo services business. premiums are charged to peo services to cover the claims expected to be incurred by the peo services' worksite employees. changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are recognized by adp indemnity. during fiscal 2015, adp indemnity paid a premium of $167.9 million to enter into a reinsurance arrangement with ace american insurance company to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for the fiscal 2015 policy year up to $1 million per occurrence related to the workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for peo services worksite employees. adp indemnity paid a premium of $202.0 million in july 2015 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with ace american insurance company to cover substantially all losses for the fiscal 2016 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2015 reinsurance policy.

28
our principal sources of liquidity for operations are derived from cash generated through operations and through corporate cash and marketable securities on hand. we continued to generate positive cash flows from operations during fiscal 2015, and we held approximately $1.7 billion of cash and marketable securities at june 30, 2015. we have the ability to borrow through our financing arrangements under our u.s. short-term commercial paper program and our u.s. and canadian short-term reverse repurchase agreements to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations.

net cash flows of investing activities changed due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of restricted cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations of $5,498.4 million, partially offset by the receipt of the cdk dividend during fiscal 2015.
net cash flows of financing activities changed due to the net increase in client funds obligations of $9,063.9 million, as a result of the timing of cash received and payments made related to client funds, partially offset by an increase in our repurchases of common stock and the timing of borrowings and repayments of commercial paper.
we purchased approximately 18.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $84.96 during fiscal 2015 as compared to purchases of 9.0 million shares at an average price per share of $75.06 during fiscal 2014. the repurchases in fiscal 2015 were partially funded by the $825.0 million dividend received from cdk earlier this fiscal year.  from time to time, the company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase programs.  the company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.
our u.s. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained through a short-term commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. during fiscal 2015, this commercial paper program provided for the issuance of up to $7.5 billion in aggregate maturity value; in july 2015, we increased our u.s. short-term commercial paper program to provide for the issuance of up to $8.25 billion in aggregate maturity value. our commercial paper program is rated a-1+ by standard and poor's and prime-1 by moody's. these ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities.  maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days.  for fiscal 2015 and 2014, our average daily borrowings were $2.3 billion at a weighted average interest rate of 0.1%. the weighted average maturity of the company's commercial paper during fiscal 2015 was approximately two days. we have successfully borrowed through the use of our commercial paper program on an as needed basis to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. at june 30, 2015, we had no outstanding obligations under our short-term commercial paper program. at june 30, 2014, we had $2.2 billion of commercial paper outstanding, which was repaid on july 1, 2014.
our u.s. and canadian short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. these agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days.  we
29
have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as needed basis to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. at june 30, 2015 and 2014, there were no outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements. for fiscal 2015 and 2014, we had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of $421.2 million and $361.7 million, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively. in addition, we have $3.25 billion available to us on a committed basis under these reverse repurchase agreements. we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the committed reverse repurchase agreements to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $3.25 billion available to us under the committed reverse repurchase agreements.
we have a $2.75 billion, 364-day credit agreement with a group of lenders that matures in june 2016. in addition, we have a five-year $2.25 billion credit facility and a five-year $3.25 billion credit facility maturing in june 2020 and june 2019, respectively, each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500.0 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. the interest rate applicable to committed borrowings is tied to libor, the effective federal funds rate, or the prime rate depending on the notification provided by the company to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing.  the company is also required to pay facility fees on the credit agreements. the primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary.  we had no borrowings through june 30, 2015 under the credit agreements. we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $8.25 billion available to us under the revolving credit agreements.
our investment portfolio does not contain any asset-backed securities with underlying collateral of subprime mortgages, alternative-a mortgages, sub-prime auto loans or sub-prime home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non-investment grade fixed-income securities. we own aaa rated senior tranches of fixed rate credit card, auto loan, rate reduction, and other asset-backed securities, secured predominately by prime collateral.  all collateral on asset-backed securities is performing as expected.  in addition, we own senior debt directly issued by federal home loan banks and federal farm credit banks.  we do own mortgage-backed securities, which represent an undivided beneficial ownership interest in a group or pool of one or more residential mortgages.  these securities are collateralized by the cash flows of 15-year and 30-year residential mortgages and are guaranteed primarily by federal national mortgage association as to the timely payment of principal and interest.  our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio).  this investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations.
capital expenditures for continuing operations in fiscal 2015 were $171.2 million, as compared to $161.0 million in fiscal 2014 and $129.4 million in fiscal 2013. the capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 related to our data center and other facility improvements were made to support our operations. we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 to be between $225 million and $250 million.
the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations as of june 30, 2015:
(in millions)                                                                                                                                                                           payments due by period contractual obligations                                                          less than 1 year            1-3years            3-5 years      more than 5 years          unknown                       total debt obligations (1)                                                                 $2.5                   $9.2                  $-            $-                         $-                        $11.7

(1)   these amounts represent the principal repayments of our debt and are included on our consolidated balance sheets. the estimated interest payments due by the corresponding period above are excluded from the above and are not material for any periods presented.
(2)   included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases and software license agreements. we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment, as well as the licensing of software. the majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices. our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements.
(3)   purchase obligations are comprised of a $202.0 million reinsurance premium with ace american insurance company for the fiscal 2016 policy year, as well as obligations related to purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment, and other assets.
(4)   we made the determination that net cash payments expected to be paid within the next 12 months, related to unrecognized tax benefits of $27.1 million at june 30, 2015, are expected to be up to $1 million. we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the period beyond the next 12 months in which cash payments related to unrecognized tax benefits are expected to be paid.
(5)   compensation and benefits primarily relates to amounts associated with our employee benefit plans and other compensation arrangements. these amounts exclude the estimated contributions to our defined benefit plans, which are expected to be $10.7 million in fiscal 2016.
(6)   acquisition-related obligations relate to deferred purchase consideration payments at future dates. a liability is established at the time of the acquisition for these fixed payments.
in addition to the obligations quantified in the table above, we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services. as of june 30, 2015, the obligations relating to these matters, which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2016, total $24,650.5 million and were recorded in client funds obligations on our consolidated balance sheets. we had $24,865.3 million of cash and marketable securities that have been impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our consolidated balance sheets as of june 30, 2015.
adp indemnity provides workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for peo services worksite employees up to $1 million per occurrence. peo services has secured specific per occurrence and aggregate stop loss insurance from a wholly-owned and regulated insurance carrier of aig that covers all losses in excess of $1 million per occurrence and also any aggregate losses within the $1 million retention that collectively exceed a certain level in certain policy years. should aig and its wholly-owned insurance company be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations, adp would also become responsible for satisfying these worksite employee workers' compensation obligations for these claims in excess of $1 million per occurrence. we utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability for the peo services business. premiums are charged to peo services to cover the claims expected to be incurred by the peo services' worksite employees. changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are recognized by adp indemnity. during fiscal 2015, adp indemnity paid a premium of $167.9 million to enter into a reinsurance agreement with ace american insurance company to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for the fiscal 2015 policy year up to $1 million per occurrence related to the workers' compensation and employers' liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for peo services worksite employees. adp indemnity paid a premium of $202.0 million in july 2015 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with ace american insurance company to cover substantially all losses for the fiscal 2016 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2015 reinsurance policy. at june 30, 2015, adp indemnity had total assets of $433.3 million to satisfy the actuarially estimated unpaid losses of $369.8 million for the policy years since july 1, 2003. adp indemnity paid claims of $26.0 million and $45.3 million, net of insurance recoveries, in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively.
in the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products. we do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties.
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and long-term marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees).
our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities.  these assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury and/or acquisitions, as well as other
31
corporate operating purposes.  all of our short-term and long-term fixed-income securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.
our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary objectives. consistent with those objectives, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income.  client funds assets are invested in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase, and money market securities and other cash equivalents.  at june 30, 2015, approximately 93% of the available-for-sale securities categorized as u.s. treasury and direct obligations of u.s. government agencies were invested in senior, unsecured, non-callable debt directly issued by the federal home loan banks and federal farm credit banks.
we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations.  our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio).  as part of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities.  we minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client's obligation becomes due by impounding, in virtually all instances, the client's funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client's obligation.  as a result of this practice, we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations.
there are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets.  such risks include liquidity risk, including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available-for-sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations.  however, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations.  we also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under our $8.25 billion commercial paper program (rated a-1+ by standard and poor's and prime-1 (p-1) by moody's, the highest possible credit ratings), our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions ($3.25 billion of which is available on a committed basis), and available borrowings under our $8.25 billion committed credit facilities. the reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short-term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business.  in addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below.
we have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments.  the minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate and canadian provincial bonds is bbb, for asset-backed securities is aaa, and for municipal bonds is a.  the maximum maturity at time of purchase for bbb rated securities is 5 years, for single a rated securities is 7 years, and for aa rated and aaa rated securities is 10 years. time deposits and commercial paper must be rated a-1 and/or p-1. money market funds must be rated aaa/aaa-mf.

we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested.  factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short-term and long-term investments.  this mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes.  the annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio remained consistent at 1.7% for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014.  a hypothetical change in both short-term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $12 million impact to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending june 30, 2016.  a hypothetical change in only short-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short-term investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $4 million impact to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending june 30, 2016.
we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities.  we limit credit risk by investing in investment-grade securities, primarily aaa and aa rated securities, as rated by moody's, standard & poor's, and for canadian securities, dominion bond rating service. approximately 80% of our available-for-sale securities held a aaa or aa rating at june 30, 2015.  in addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than u.s. and canadian government or government agency securities.
we operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. we experienced pressure from foreign currency translation on our revenue and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes in fiscal 2015 and expect this pressure to continue in the early part of fiscal 2016. we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. we may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. we had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at june 30, 2015 or 2014.

recently issued accounting pronouncements in april 2015, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") 2015-05, customer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. the update provides guidance on whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. if a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. asu no. 2015-05 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2015. early adoption is permitted. we have not yet determined the impact of asu 2015-05 on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
in april 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-04, "compensation - retirement benefits (topic 715): practical expedient for the measurement date of an employer's defined benefit obligation and plan assets." the update allows an entity to remeasure their pension and other post-retirement benefit plan assets and liabilities at the month-end closest to a significant event such as a plan amendment, curtailment, or settlement. asu 2015-04 is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2015. early adoption is permitted. the impact of asu 2015-04 is dependent upon the nature of future significant events impacting our pension plans, if any.
in april 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-03, "simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs." the update requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset. the update requires retrospective application. asu 2015-03 is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2015. early adoption is permitted. the impact of asu 2015-03 is dependent upon the nature of future debt issuances, if any.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers," which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. asu 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize revenue depicting the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. asu 2014-09 will also result in enhanced revenue related disclosures. asu 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is permitted. we have not yet determined the impact of asu 2014-09 on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
in april 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-08, "reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity." asu 2014-08 requires that a disposal representing a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's financial results or a business activity classified as held for sale should be reported as discontinued operations. asu 2014-08 also expands the disclosure requirements for discontinued operations and adds new disclosures for individually significant dispositions that do not qualify as discontinued operations. asu 2014-08 is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2014. the impact of asu 2014-08 is dependent upon the nature of dispositions, if any, after adoption.
in july 2014, we adopted asu 2013-11, "presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists." asu 2013-11 requires netting of unrecognized tax benefits against a deferred tax asset for a loss or other carryforward that would apply in settlement of the uncertain tax position. the adoption of asu 2013-11 did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. the estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.
34
revenue recognition. our revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services (e.g., employer services' payroll processing fees), investment income on payroll funds, payroll tax filing funds and other employer services' client-related funds, and fees charged to implement clients on the company's solutions. we enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction (e.g., number of payees or number of payrolls processed). fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
we report peo revenues net of direct pass-through costs, which are costs billed and incurred for peo services worksite employees, primarily consisting of payroll wages and payroll taxes. benefits, workers' compensation, and state unemployment tax fees for worksite employees are included in peo revenues and the associated costs are included in operating expenses.
we recognize interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients in revenues as earned, as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services.
client implementation fees are charged to set clients up on our solutions and are deferred until the client has gone live and services have begun. these fees are amortized to revenue over the longer of the contractual term or expected client life, including estimated renewals of client contracts.
we assess the collectability of revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer's payment history.
goodwill. we account for goodwill in accordance with asc 350-10, which states that goodwill should not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. we perform this impairment test by first comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. if the carrying value for a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then compare the implied fair value of our goodwill to the carrying amount in order to determine the amount of the impairment, if any. we determine the fair value of our reporting units using an equal weighted blended approach, which combines the income approach, which is the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital; and the market approach, which is based on using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business. significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of our reporting units include projected revenue growth rates, profitability projections, working capital assumptions, the weighted-average cost of capital, the determination of appropriate market comparison companies, and terminal growth rates. we had $1,793.5 million of goodwill as of june 30, 2015. based on the fair value analysis completed in the fourth quarter of 2015, management concluded that fair value exceeded carrying value for all reporting units and that no reporting units were at risk of goodwill impairment. in completing the annual impairment test for fiscal 2015, we evaluated the reasonableness of differences noted between the fair value and carrying value of each reporting unit. given the significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated earnings if we are unable to generate the anticipated revenue growth, synergies and/or cost savings associated with our acquisitions. in fiscal 2014, the company performed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill and determined that there were no impairments. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, there was an impairment charge of $42.7 million for the adp advancedmd reporting unit.
income taxes. the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities. a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
there is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. specifically, the likelihood of an entity's tax benefits being sustained must be "more likely than not" assuming that those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements. if a tax position drops below the "more likely than not" standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. assumptions, judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the "more likely than not" standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes. a change in the assessment of the "more likely than not" standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. as of june 30, 2015 and 2014, the company's liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were $27.1 million and $56.5 million, respectively.
35
if certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions. based on current estimates, favorable settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to $5 million in the next twelve months. audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.
stock-based compensation. we measure stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option-pricing model. the binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, and employee exercise behavior. expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price, and other factors. similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. the risk-free rate is derived from the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. the binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. determining these assumptions is subjective and complex, and, therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options.

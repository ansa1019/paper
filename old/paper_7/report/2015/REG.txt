item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executing on our strategy during 2015, we executed on our strategic objectives to further solidify regency's position as a leader among shopping center reits:
sustain average annual 3% noi growth from a high-quality, growing portfolio of thriving community and neighborhood shopping centers.
we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores, major retail anchors, restaurants, side-shop retailers, and service providers, as well as ground leasing or selling out-parcels to these same types of tenants. we experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers, by acquiring and developing new shopping centers, and by redeveloping shopping centers within our portfolio. noteworthy milestones and achievements during 2015 include:
•   we achieved pro-rata same property noi growth, excluding termination fees, of 4.4% in 2015, marking four consecutive years of 4% growth.
•   we maintained our pro-rata same property percent leased at 95.8% at december 31, 2015 and 2014.
•   we grew rental rates 9.6% on comparable spaces for new and renewal leases.
•   we cost effectively invested in the acquisition of one operating property and funded the purchase with $50 million from the sale of a center with a similar cap rate but a lower growth opportunity and greater anchor risk.
develop new, high quality shopping centers and redevelop existing centers at attractive returns on investment from a disciplined development program.
we capitalize on our development capabilities, market presence, and anchor relationships by investing in new developments and redevelopments of existing centers.
•   during 2015, we started $116.7 million of development and redevelopment projects with a weighted average estimated yield of 7.5%.
•   as of december 31, 2015, we have seven ground-up developments in process, with total expected net development costs of $163.9 million with projected return on capital of 7.7%, and are currently 83% leased. we also have thirteen redevelopments of existing centers in process with total expected net redevelopment costs of $81.8 million and incremental yields ranging from 7.0% - 10.0%.
cost-effectively enhance our already strong balance sheet to reduce our cost of capital, provide financial flexibility and weather economic downturns.
we fund acquisitions and development activities from various capital sources including operating cash flow, property sales through a disciplined match-funding strategy of selling low growth assets, equity offerings, new debt financing, and capital from our co-investment partners.
•   we managed our balance sheet to improve our debt maturity profile by refinancing and reducing our unsecured borrowings, thereby leveling our maturities to better withstand downturns in the financial markets and efficiently fund investments.
•   we cost effectively sold $193.6 million in common stock through our forward equity offering in january. net proceeds of $186.2 million were received in november upon settlement and used a portion to improve our debt maturity profile. in addition, we issued 189,200 shares through our atm program resulting in net proceeds of $12.7 million.
•   at december 31, 2015, our net debt-to-core ebitda ratio was 5.2x versus 5.7x at december 31, 2014. we had $36.9 million of cash and no outstanding balance on our $800.0 million line of credit.

engage a talented and dedicated team that operates efficiently and is recognized as a leader in the real estate industry with respect to development and operating capabilities, customer relationships, operating and technology systems, and environmental sustainability.
•   we executed on our succession plan with our bench of proven and experienced executives with the promotion of lisa palmer to president, in addition to her existing role of chief financial officer. additionally, we promoted two managing directors to executive vice president of operations and of development, respectively.
•   we worked to increase employee engagement through a variety of employee-related initiatives.
•   we developed critical information platforms that provide value added decision making capabilities.
leasing activity and significant tenants we believe our high-quality, grocery anchored shopping centers located in densely populated, desirable infill trade areas create attractive spaces for retail tenants. improvements in the economy, combined with historically low levels of new supply and robust tenant demand, allow us to focus on merchandising of our centers to ensure the right mix of operators and unique retailers, which draws more retail customers to our centers.
pro-rata occupancy for the purpose of the following disclosures of occupancy and leasing activity, anchor space is considered space greater than or equal to 10,000 sf and shop space is less than 10,000 sf. the following table summarizes pro-rata occupancy rates of our combined consolidated and unconsolidated shopping center portfolio:
december 31,   december 31,
2015           2014
% leased - operating          95.9%          95.9%
anchor space                  98.5%          98.8%
shop space                    91.7%          91.2%
the percent leased in our operating portfolio remained constant in 2015. during the fourth quarter of 2015, we successfully recaptured two anchor spaces, giving us control over the future tenant mix at these centers and the ability to improve rents. our shop space experienced pro-rata occupancy gains of 50 basis points driven primarily by new leasing and lower than historical move-out rates.

overall, leasing activity continues to be strong. in the shop space category for both new leases and renewals, base rent psf continued to increase on leases executed in 2015. in the anchor category, base rent psf on new leases decreased slightly due to the geographic location of anchor deals in 2015 as compared to 2014.
significant tenants and concentrations of risk we seek to reduce our operating and leasing risks through geographic diversification and by avoiding dependence on any single property, market, or tenant. the following table summarizes our three most significant tenants, each of which is a grocery tenant, occupying our shopping centers:

(2) includes our pro-rata share of unconsolidated properties and excludes those owned by anchors.
bankruptcies although base rent is supported by long-term lease contracts, tenants who file bankruptcy may have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores. in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases, we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues. we monitor the operating performance and rent collections of all tenants in our shopping centers, especially those tenants operating retail formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition, business practice, and store closings in other locations. we are not currently aware of the pending bankruptcy or announced store closings of any tenants in our shopping centers that would individually cause a material reduction in our revenues, and no tenant represents more than 5% of our annual base rent on a pro-rata basis.
our management team devotes significant time to monitoring consumer preferences, shopping behaviors, and demographics to anticipate both challenges and opportunities in the changing retail industry that may affect our tenants. as a result of our findings, we may reduce new leasing, suspend leasing, or curtail the allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer.

the $6.9 million decrease in interest expense, net is mainly due to lower interest rates from refinancing our long-term debt during 2014 and 2015 and lower outstanding balances on notes payable.
we did not recognize impairment losses during 2015. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recognized a $1.1 million loss on the disposal of one operating property and one land parcel and a $175,000 impairment on two parcels of land held.
during november 2015, we incurred an $8.2 million charge from a make-whole premium on our $100.0 million early redemption of the $400.0 million outstanding 5.875% senior unsecured notes that are due in 2017.
net investment income decreased $8.8 million, largely driven by an $8.1 million gain realized on the sale of available-for-sale securities in 2014 and a $1.1 million decrease in the fair value of plan assets in the non-qualified deferred compensation plan during 2015, which is consistent with the change in plan liabilities included in general and administrative expenses above.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we acquired the remaining 50% interest and gained control of a previously unconsolidated investment in a real estate partnership that owns a single operating property. as the operating property constitutes a business, acquisition of control was accounted for as a step acquisition, and the net assets acquired were recognized at fair value. the gain of $18.3 million was recognized as the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the company's previously held equity interest, using an income approach to measure fair value.

columbia i: $1.8 million decrease from impairment loss upon the sale of one operating property during 2015;
columbia ii: $424,000 increase due to impairment losses recognized upon the sale of two properties during 2014; and other investments in real estate partnerships: $11.4 million decrease within our other investment partnerships driven by the $10.9 million gains on the sale of two land parcels and two operating properties during 2014.

our interest expense, net increased $525,000 mainly due to the $77.8 million of mortgage debt assumed with a portfolio acquisition in the first quarter of 2014, offset by additional capitalized interest on development projects.
during 2014, we recognized a $1.1 million of loss on the disposal of one operating property and one land parcel and a $175,000 impairment on two parcels of land held. during the year ended december 31, 2013, we recognized a $6.0 million impairment on a single operating property.
net investment income increased $6.2 million, largely driven by an $8.1 million gain realized on the sale of available-for-sale securities offset by a $1.9 million decrease in net investment income from the deferred compensation plan relating to the change in the fair value of plan assets.
during 2014, we acquired the remaining 50% interest and gained control of a previously unconsolidated investment in a real estate partnership that owns a single operating property. as the operating property constitutes a business, acquisition of control was accounted for as a step acquisition, and the net assets acquired were recognized at fair value. the gain of $18.3 million was recognized as the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the company's previously held equity interest, using an income approach to measure fair value.

(1) as of december 31, 2012, our ownership interest in mcwr iii was 24.95%. the liquidation of mcwr iii was complete effective march 20, 2013.
(2) on august 13, 2013, the fund sold 100% of its interest in its entire portfolio of shopping centers to a third party. the fund will be dissolved following the final distribution of proceeds in 2014.
(3) on october 23, 2013, the company sold 100% of its interest in the bret unconsolidated real estate partnership and received a capital distribution of $47.5 million, its share of the undistributed income of the partnership, and a redemption premium. regency no longer has any interest in the bret partnership.
the decrease in our equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships is principally due to the following:
•   grir: $947,000 increase from gain on one operating property disposal in 2014;
•   columbia ii: $1.0 million decrease due to $424,000 of impairment losses recognized upon sale of two properties in 2014 compared to $830,000 of gains recognized in 2013 on the sale of four operating properties and one land parcel;
•   regcal: $654,000 gain on one operating property disposal in 2014;
•   the fund: all operating properties were sold in august 2013 for gains of $7.4 million. the only activity in 2014 was collection of remaining receivables and the final distribution;
•   bret: $4.5 million decrease from liquidating our ownership interest in october 2013; and,
•   other investments in real estate partnerships: $11.2 million increase driven by 2014 gains of $10.9 million on the sale of two land parcels and two operating properties.

net cash provided by operating activities:
net cash provided by operating activities increased by $2.1 million during 2015 as compared to 2014 due to:
•   $18.3 million increase in cash from operating income; and
•   $3.9 million increase in operating cash flow distributions from our unconsolidated real estate partnerships as several redevelopment projects were completed and began distributing cash flows; reduced by,
•   $12.3 million net decrease in cash due to timing of cash receipts and payments related to operating activities; and
•   $11.9 million decrease in cash from payments to settle our treasury hedges in connection with our bond issuances. during 2015 we paid $7.3 million as compared to receiving $4.6 million in 2014 because of changes in the underlying ten year treasury rates.
we operate our business such that we expect net cash provided by operating activities will provide the necessary funds to pay our distributions to our common and preferred stock and unit holders, which were $202.8 million and $194.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. our dividend distribution policy is set by our board of directors who monitors our financial position. our board of directors recently declared our common stock quarterly dividend of $0.500 per share, payable on march 3, 2016. future dividends will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors and will be subject to capital requirements and availability. we plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that, at a minimum, meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a reit for federal income tax purposes.

significant investing and divesting activities included:
•   we acquired one shopping center in 2015, compared to four during 2014.
•   we received proceeds of $108.8 million from the sale of five shopping centers and two out-parcels in 2015, compared to $118.8 million for eleven shopping centers and six out-parcels in 2015.
•   we invested $20.1 million in our unconsolidated partnerships during 2015 to fund our share of maturing mortgage debt and redevelopment activities. in 2014, we invested $23.6 million to acquire an operating property and to fund redevelopment activity.
•   distributions from our unconsolidated partnerships include return of capital from sales or financing proceeds. the $23.8 million received in 2015 includes $12.8 million of proceeds from the sale of one shopping center with a co-investment partner and $11.0 million of financing proceeds. distributions in 2014 were from real estate sales proceeds of $32.1 million and $5.1 million from refinancing a loan.
•   acquisition of securities and proceeds from sale of securities include investments in equity and debt securities. during 2015, we invested $7.9 million of funds held in our captive insurance subsidiary in available-for-sale marketable securities. our insurance subsidiary is required to maintain statutory minimum capital and surplus, and therefore, our access to these securities may be limited. in 2014, we paid $14.3 million for the acquisition of amreit common stock, and received $22.1 million in proceeds upon the subsequent sale. the remaining activity, during both 2015 and 2014, primarily relating to our deferred compensation plan.
we plan to continue developing and redeveloping shopping centers for long-term investment purposes. we deployed capital of $205.1 million for the development, redevelopment, and improvement of our real estate properties as comprised of the following:

•   during 2015 we acquired two land parcels for new development projects as compared to six in 2014.
•   building and tenant improvements decreased $5.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily related to timing of capital projects.
•   redevelopment expenditures were higher during 2015 due to the timing, magnitude, and number of projects currently in process. we intend to continuously improve our portfolio of shopping centers through redevelopment which can include adjacent land acquisition, existing building expansion, new out-parcel building construction, and tenant improvement costs. the size and scope of each redevelopment project varies with each redevelopment plan.
•   the $1.7 million increase in our development project expenditures was due to the size of and progress on developments. see the table below for a detail of current and recently completed development projects.
•   capitalized direct compensation represents overhead costs of our development and construction team directly related to the development projects, with the majority of capitalizable direct compensation costs incurred at or near inception of a development project. the decreased number and size of projects starting in 2015 as compared to 2014 resulted in the decrease in capitalized compensation costs. during 2015 we started $106.1 million of development and redevelopment projects as compared to $213.7 million in 2014.
we have a staff of employees who directly support our development and redevelopment program. internal compensation costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized as part of each project as summarized in the table above. changes in the level of future development and redevelopment activity could adversely impact results of operations by reducing the amount of internal costs for development and redevelopment projects that may be capitalized. a 10% reduction in development and redevelopment activity without a corresponding reduction in the compensation costs directly related to our development and redevelopment activities could result in an additional charge to net income of $1.4 million per year.
as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, we had seven development projects that were either under construction or in lease up. the following table summarizes our development projects:

significant financing activities during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 include:
•   during 2015, the parent company issued 2.9 million shares of common stock in an underwritten forward public equity offering that settled in november 2015 resulting in net proceeds of $185.8 million. additionally, the parent company issued 189,000 shares of common stock through its atm program at an average price of $67.86 per share resulting in net proceeds of $12.7 million. during 2014, the parent company issued 1.7 million shares of common stock through our atm program at an average price of $60.00 per share. the proceeds were used to repay debt and fund investment activities.
•   during 2015, we increased our dividend distribution rate on our common stock and operating partnership units.
•   during 2015, we borrowed $90.0 million on our term loan, with no such borrowings during 2014.
•   during both 2015 and 2014, we issued new $250.0 million fixed rate ten-year unsecured public debt, net of discount and issuance costs, and received proceeds of $4.3 million and $10 million from a non-recourse property mortgages during 2015 and 2014, respectively.
•   during 2015, we used $532.0 million to repay debt, including $350.0 million to repay our 5.25% fixed rate ten-year unsecured public debt that matured in august 2015, $100 million to redeem a portion of our 2017 unsecured public debt in november 2015, $76.2 million to repay three mortgages that matured in 2015, and $5.9 million for scheduled principal payments. during 2014, we used $195.6 million to repay debt, including $150.0 million to repay our 4.95% fixed-rate ten-year unsecured public debt that matured, $38.7 million to repay mortgages that matured in 2014, and $6.9 million for scheduled principal payments.
we endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets. as of december 31, 2015, 80.3% of our wholly-owned real estate assets were unencumbered. such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain availability on the line. our coverage ratio, including our pro-rata share of our partnerships, was 2.8 and 2.5 times for the trailing four quarters ended december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively. we define our coverage ratio as earnings before interest, taxes, investment transaction profits net of deal costs, depreciation and amortization ("core ebitda")
50
divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders.
through the end of 2016, we estimate that we will require approximately $198.7 million of cash, including $126.2 million to complete in-process developments and redevelopments, $41.4 million to repay maturing debt, and $31.1 million to fund our pro-rata share of estimated capital contributions to our co-investment partnerships for repayment of debt. if we start new developments or redevelop additional shopping centers, our cash requirements will increase. if we refinance maturing debt, our cash requirements will decrease. to meet our cash requirements, we may utilize cash generated from operations, proceeds from the sale of real estate, available borrowings from our line, and when the capital markets are favorable, proceeds from the sale of equity and the issuance of new long-term debt.
we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt, to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments. based upon the current capital markets, our current credit ratings, and the number of high quality, unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings, we currently expect that we will successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund our obligations, as needed.
we have $300.0 million of fixed rate, unsecured debt maturing june 15, 2017. we expect to issue new fixed rate unsecured debt in 2017. in order to mitigate the risk of interest rate volatility, we previously entered into $220.0 million of forward starting interest rate swaps to partially hedge the new long-term debt issued in 2017. these interest rate swaps lock in the 10-year treasury rate and swap spread at a weighted average fixed rate of 3.48%, respectively. a current market based credit spread applicable to regency will be added to the locked in fixed rate at time of issuance that will determine the final bond yield. we will cash settle these forward starting interest rate swaps when we issue the new debt. the actual cash settlement may differ from the current fair value of these interest rate swaps based on movements in interest rates.
our line, term loan, and unsecured loans require that we remain in compliance with various covenants, which are described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. we are in compliance with these covenants at december 31, 2015 and expect to remain in compliance.
contractual obligations we have debt obligations related to our mortgage loans, unsecured notes, unsecured credit facilities and interest rate swap obligations as described further below and in note 9 and note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. we have shopping centers that are subject to non-cancelable long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to us to construct and/or operate a shopping center. in addition, we have non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which we conduct our business.
the following table of contractual obligations summarizes our debt maturities, including our pro-rata share of obligations within co-investment partnerships as of december 31, 2015, and excludes the following:
•   recorded debt premiums or discounts that are not obligations;
•   obligations related to construction or development contracts, since payments are only due upon satisfactory performance under the contracts;
•   letters of credit of $5.9 million issued to cover performance obligations on certain development projects, which will be satisfied upon completion of the development projects; and
•   obligations for retirement savings plans due to uncertainty around timing of participant withdrawals, which are solely within the control of the participant, and are further discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.

(1) includes interest payments.
(2) we are obligated to contribute our pro-rata share to fund maturities if they are not refinanced. we believe that our partners are financially sound and have sufficient capital or access thereto to fund future capital requirements.  in the event that a co-investment partner was unable to fund its share of the capital requirements of the co-investment partnership, we would have the right, but not the obligation, to loan the defaulting partner the amount of its capital call.
critical accounting estimates knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements. the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities as of a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period. these accounting estimates are based upon, but not limited to, our judgments about historical and expected future results, current market conditions, and interpretation of industry accounting standards. they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments, or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates. we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness; however, the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates.
accounts receivable and straight line rent minimum rent, percentage rent, and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs, insurance and real estate taxes are the company's principal source of revenue. as a result of generating this revenue, we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants. we are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that may affect the collection of outstanding receivables. to address the collectability of these receivables, we analyze historical tenant collection rates, write-off experience, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and straight line rent reserve. although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income, actual experience may differ from those estimates.
real estate investments acquisition of real estate investments upon acquisition of real estate operating properties, the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building, building improvements and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases and in-place leases), assumed debt, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date. based on these estimates, the company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities. fair value is determined based on an exit price approach, which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. if, up to one year from the acquisition date, information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined, appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation on a retrospective basis. the company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred.
we strategically co-invest with partners to own, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop operating properties. we analyze our investments in real estate partnerships in order to determine whether the entity should be consolidated. if it is determined that these investments do not require consolidation because the entities are not variable interest entities ("vies"), we are not considered the primary beneficiary of the entities determined to be vies, we do not have voting control, and/or the limited partners (or non-managing members) have substantive participatory rights, then the selection of the accounting method used to account for our investments in real estate partnerships is generally determined by our voting interests and the degree of influence we have over the entity. management uses its judgment when making these determinations. we use the equity method of accounting for investments in real estate partnerships when we own 20% or more of the voting interests and have significant influence but do not have a controlling financial interest, or if we own less than 20% of the voting interests but have determined that we have significant influence. under the equity method, we record our investments in and advances to these entities as investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated balance sheets, and our proportionate share of earnings or losses earned by the joint venture is recognized in equity in income (loss) of investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated statements of operations.
development of real estate assets and cost capitalization we capitalize the acquisition of land, the construction of buildings, and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them in properties in development in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. other specifically identifiable development costs include pre-development costs essential to the development process, as well as, interest, real estate taxes, and direct employee costs incurred during the development period. once a development property is substantially complete and held available for occupancy, these indirect costs are no longer capitalized.
52
•   pre-development costs are incurred prior to land acquisition during the due diligence phase and include contract deposits, legal, engineering, and other professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center. if we determine it is probable that a specific project undergoing due diligence will not be developed, we immediately expense all related capitalized pre-development costs not considered recoverable.
•   interest costs are capitalized to each development project based on applying our weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development costs expended. we cease interest cost capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after the anchor opens for business. during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we capitalized interest of $6.7 million, $7.1 million, and $6.1 million, respectively, on our development projects.
•   real estate taxes are capitalized to each development project over the same period as we capitalize interest.
•   we have a staff of employees who directly support our development program. all direct internal costs attributable to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development project. the capitalization of costs is directly related to the actual level of development activity occurring. during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we capitalized $13.8 million, $16.1 million, and $11.7 million, respectively, of direct internal costs incurred to support our development program.
valuation of real estate investments we evaluate whether there are any indicators that have occurred, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that would result in us determining that the carrying value of our real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable. if such indicators occur, we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, anticipated hold period, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate. these key assumptions are subjective in nature and the resulting impairment, if any, could differ from the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate sale in an arm's length transaction. if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value. changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group, which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the company's financial condition or operating performance.
we evaluate our investments in real estate partnerships for impairment whenever there are indicators, including underlying property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of our investments in real estate partnerships may be impaired. an investment in a real estate partnerships is considered impaired only if we determine that its fair value is less than the net carrying value of the investment in that real estate partnerships on an other-than-temporary basis. cash flow projections for the investments consider property level factors, such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. we consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment is other-than-temporary. these factors include the age of the real estate partnerships, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, the financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity and relationships with our partners and banks. if we believe that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary, no impairment charge is recorded. if our analysis indicates that there is an other-than-temporary impairment related to the investment in a particular real estate partnership, the carrying value of the investment will be adjusted to an amount that reflects the estimated fair value of the investment.
the fair value of real estate investments is subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available, or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization or the traditional discounted cash flow methods. such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors, and therefore are subject to management judgment and changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value. in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, we generally use market data and comparable sales information.
derivative instruments the company utilizes financial derivative instruments to manage risks associated with changing interest rates. specifically, the company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or future payment of known and uncertain cash amounts, the amount of which are determined by interest rates.  the company's derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the company's known or expected cash payments principally related to the company's borrowings.  for additional information on the company's use and accounting for derivatives, see notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
53
the company assesses effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis. the effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of equity. our cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts, settlement dates, reset dates, calculation period and libor rate.  if a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective, the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected.
the fair value of the company's interest rate derivatives is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.  this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities.  the company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 1 to consolidated financial statements.
environmental matters we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry, the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers, and underground petroleum storage tanks. we believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations. generally, we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendly systems. where available, we have applied and been accepted into state-sponsored environmental programs. we have a blanket environmental insurance policy for third-party liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination. we have also placed environmental insurance, where possible, on specific properties with known contamination, in order to mitigate our environmental risk. we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites. we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so.
as of december 31, 2015 we had accrued liabilities of $9.1 million for our pro-rata share of environmental remediation. we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations; however, we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us; that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by unrelated third parties; or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with other unconsolidated entities (other than our unconsolidated investment partnerships) or other persons, also known as variable interest entities, not previously discussed. our unconsolidated investment partnership properties have been financed with non-recourse loans. we have no guarantees related to these loans.
inflation/deflation inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers; however, inflation may become a greater concern in the future. substantially all of our long-term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. most of our leases require tenants to pay their pro-rata share of operating expenses, including common-area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. in addition, many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years, which permits us to seek increased rents upon re-rental at market rates. however, during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness, minimum rents and percentage rents will decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines. occupancy declines resulting from a weak economic period will also likely result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses.

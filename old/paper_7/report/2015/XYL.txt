item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and the financial condition of our business during each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended december 31, 2015. except as otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, "xylem," "we," "us," "our" and "the company" refer to xylem inc. and its subsidiaries.
overview xylem is a leading equipment and service provider for water and wastewater applications with a broad portfolio of products and services addressing the full cycle of water, from collection, distribution and use to the return of water to the environment. our business focuses on providing technology-intensive equipment and services. our product and service offerings are organized into two reportable segments: water infrastructure and applied water. our segments are aligned with each of the sectors in the cycle of water, water infrastructure and usage applications.
•   water infrastructure serves the water infrastructure sector with pump systems that transport water from aquifers, lakes, rivers and seas; with filtration, ultraviolet and ozone systems that provide treatment, making the water fit to use; and pumping solutions that move the wastewater to treatment facilities where our mixers, biological treatment, monitoring and control systems provide the primary functions in the treatment process. we provide analytical instrumentation used to measure water quality, flow and level in wastewater, surface water and coastal environments. in the water infrastructure segment, we provide the majority of our sales directly to customers with strong application expertise, while the remaining amount is through distribution partners.
•   applied water serves the usage applications sector with water pressure boosting systems for heating, ventilation and air conditioning and for fire protection systems to the residential and commercial building services markets. in addition, our pumps, heat exchangers, valves and controls provide cooling to power plants and manufacturing facilities, as well as circulation for food and beverage processing. we also provide boosting systems for farming irrigation, pumps for dairy operations and rainwater reuse systems for small scale crop and turf irrigation. in the applied water segment, we provide the majority of our sales through long-standing relationships with the world's leading distributors, with the remainder going directly to customers.
we sell our equipment and services through direct and indirect channels that serve the needs of each customer type. in the water infrastructure segment, we provide the majority of our sales direct to customers with strong application expertise, while the remaining amount is through distribution partners. in the applied water segment, we provide the majority of our sales through long-standing relationships with the world's leading distributors, with the remainder going direct to customers.
key performance indicators and non-gaap measures management reviews key performance indicators including revenue, gross margin, segment operating income and margins, earnings per share, orders growth, working capital, free cash flow and backlog, among others. in addition, we consider certain measures to be useful to management and investors evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented, and provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations, liquidity and management of assets. this information can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital for deployment among competing strategic alternatives and initiatives, including, but not limited to, dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. these metrics, however, are not measures of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered a substitute for revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share (basic and diluted) or net cash from operations as determined in accordance with gaap. we consider the following non-gaap measures, which may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, to be key performance indicators:
•   "organic revenue" and "organic orders" defined as revenue and orders, respectively, excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency translation, intercompany transactions and contributions from acquisitions and divestitures. divestitures include sales of insignificant portions of our business that did not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation. the period-over-period change resulting from foreign currency translation assumes no change in exchange rates from the prior period.
•   "constant currency" defined as financial results adjusted for foreign currency translation impacts by translating current period and prior period activity using the same currency conversion rate. this approach is used for countries whose functional currency is not the u.s. dollar.

executive summary xylem reported revenue of $3,653 million for 2015, a decrease of 6.7% from $3,916 million reported in 2014. revenue increased 1.3% on a constant currency basis due to strong organic growth in the public utility, commercial and residential markets, partially offset by declines in industrial in the oil and gas market. operating income for 2015 was $449 million, reflecting a decrease of $14 million or 3.0% compared to $463 million in 2014. operating income as a percentage of revenue was 12.3% for 2015 versus 11.8% for 2014, an increase of 50 basis points. this increase in operating margin was primarily due to reduced restructuring and realignment costs as well as incremental cost savings from continuous improvement initiatives and restructuring actions. partially offsetting these actions were cost inflation, unfavorable mix and unfavorable foreign exchange translation impacts.

additional financial highlights for 2015 include the following:
•   net income of $340 million, or $1.87 per diluted share ($336 million or $1.85 per diluted share on an adjusted basis)
•   free cash flow of $347 million, and net cash from operating activities of $464 million
•   orders of $3,711 million (a 0.5% increase from 2014 on an organic basis)
•   we repurchased a total of $175 million in shares under our share repurchase programs approved by our board of directors as part of our strategy to enhance shareholder return
•   dividends paid to shareholders increased 10% in 2015.
2016 business outlook we continue to anticipate organic revenue growth in the low-to-mid single digits in 2016. the following is a summary of our outlook by market.
•   industrial was down 1% for 2015 as general industrial strength was more than offset by oil and gas declines in canada and the united states. for 2016, we expect growth to be flat to up in the low-single-digits. this projection assumes low-single-digit growth in light industrial applications, and double-digit declines in oil and gas, and mining applications.
•   public utilities increased 4% for 2015 driven by the united states recovery and continued emerging markets investments. we expect growth in mid-single-digits for 2016 as we anticipate continued growth in the united states and continued investments across emerging markets. we also anticipate that market conditions in europe will remain stable.
•   commercial experienced growth of 4% for 2015 driven by a recovering institutional building sector in the united states. we expect continued growth in the mid-single-digit range for 2016. our expectation is that growth in the u.s. institutional building market will continue through the year, urbanization will continue to drive growth in most emerging markets and that conditions in europe will modestly improve.
•   residential markets grew 4% in 2015 with the strongest growth in the u.s. for 2016 we expect low-to-mid-single digit growth driven by continued strength in the u.s. we also expect continued low-single-digit growth in europe.
•   our agriculture markets, which is our smallest end market, declined 8% in 2015 driven by unfavorable u.s. weather conditions. we expect 2016 to grow low-single-digits as we will likely see a modest recovery from the significant weather events in 2015.
we will continue to strategically execute restructuring and realignment actions primarily to reposition our european and north american business in an effort to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness. during 2015, we incurred $6 million and $14 million in restructuring and realignment costs, respectively. as a result of the restructuring actions in 2015, we realized $2 million of net savings and expect to realize approximately $1 million of incremental net savings in 2016. during 2016, we expect to incur approximately $25 million in restructuring and realignment costs. we expect to realize approximately $8 million of savings from our 2016 actions.
additional strategic actions we are taking include strategic initiatives to drive above-market growth, advance continuous improvement activities to increase productivity, focus on improving cash performance and drive a disciplined capital deployment strategy.

2015 versus 2014
revenue revenue generated for 2015 was $3,653 million, a decrease of $263 million, or 6.7%, compared to $3,916 million in 2014. on a constant currency basis, revenue grew 1.3%. this increase was primarily driven by strong organic growth within emerging markets, particularly in china and india. the united states and western europe also grew organically, which was partially offset by declines in canada. in addition, the organic growth was partially offset by the divestiture of the wolverhampton valves business early in the third quarter of 2014.
the following table illustrates the impact on 2015 revenue from organic growth, recent acquisitions/divestitures, and foreign currency translation in relation to revenue.

water infrastructure water infrastructure's revenue decreased $211 million, or 8.6% in 2015 (0.9% increase on a constant currency basis) compared to 2014. the constant currency increase was driven by organic growth of $22 million or 0.9% due to continued strength in the public utility end market partially offset by weakness in the industrial market. the industrial market performance decline was due to decreases in dewatering applications in the oil and gas market which more than offset increases in the balance of the industrial market.
from an application perspective, organic revenue grew in transport, treatment and test applications. the organic revenue growth from transport applications was predominately due to public utility strength in the emerging markets, the united states and in western europe, partially offset by declines in industrial dewatering applications from weakness in the oil and gas market in canada and the united states. the organic revenue growth from treatment applications was due to ozone and filtration projects in china and australia which was somewhat offset by the lapping of a large project in latin america in 2014 and general weakness in europe. organic revenue growth from test applications was driven by growth in china and india due to demand for new wastewater and river monitoring products.
applied water applied water's revenue decreased $52 million, or 3.5% in 2015 (a 1.8% increase on a constant currency basis) compared to 2014. the growth on a constant currency basis is driven primarily by organic revenue growth of $38 million or 2.6% due to strength in the commercial, industrial water and residential end markets, partially offset by declines in the agriculture end market. this increase in the current year was partially offset by the absence of $11 million in revenue from the divested wolverhampton valves business.
from an applications perspective, the increase in organic revenue was predominately due to continued growth in commercial building services from a recovering institutional building sector in the united states and strength in asia. the industrial water application organic revenue grew from project strength in western europe and the united states, which was partially offset by the aforementioned wolverhampton divestiture. residential building services organic revenue increased primarily in the united states due to improvements in the home construction market and market share gain. irrigation applications organic revenue decline was largely impacted by severe flooding conditions in the southeast and southwest regions of the united states and the lapping of a strong fourth quarter in 2014.
orders/backlog orders received during 2015 decreased by $310 million, or 7.7% to $3,711 million (a 0.2% increase on a constant currency basis). organic order growth increased $19 million or 0.5% for the year.
water infrastructure segment orders decreased $215 million, or 8.6% to $2,296 million (1.0% growth on a constant currency basis). organic order growth of 1.0% was predominantly due to organic order increases for treatment applications due to large projects in the middle east and greater asia. the organic orders for test applications were slightly up. slightly offsetting these increases was a decline in organic orders for transport applications predominately due to decreases in the dewatering transport application due to weakness in the oil and gas market, which more than offset solid growth in the remainder of the transport applications.
orders decreased in our applied water segment $95 million, or 6.3% to $1,415 million (1.0% decline on a constant currency basis). the order decline on a constant currency basis was due to the organic order volume decrease of 0.3%, due to market softness in the oil and gas and agricultural markets, as well as the absence of orders from our wolverhampton valves divestiture.
delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based upon their requirements. typically, large projects require longer lead production cycles, and delays can occur from time to time. total backlog was $716 million at december 31, 2015 and $740 million at december 31, 2014. this decrease is due to foreign currency translation impacts. we anticipate that approximately 81% of the backlog at december 31, 2015 will be recognized as revenue during 2016.
gross margin gross margins as a percentage of consolidated revenue declined to 38.4% in 2015 from 38.6% in 2014. the gross margin decline was primarily due to negative currency translation impacts. excluding the negative currency translation impacts, gross margin was slightly higher as compared to 2014. benefits realized from cost saving initiatives through global sourcing and lean six sigma, as well as increased volume, more than offset material and labor inflation headwinds and unfavorable sales mix, primarily due to higher volume sold to the emerging markets.

research and development expenses r&d spending decreased $9 million or 8.7% to 2.6% of revenue in 2015 as compared to 2.7% of revenue in 2014 primarily due to currency translation impacts.
restructuring charges during 2015, we incurred restructuring costs of $5 million and $1 million in our water infrastructure and applied water segments, respectively. these charges were incurred primarily in an effort to realign our organizational structure in europe and north america to optimize our cost structure. the charges relate to the reduction in structural costs, including a decrease in headcount and consolidation of facilities. during 2014, we recognized restructuring costs of $19 million, $6 million and $1 million in our water infrastructure and applied water segments, and corporate and other, respectively. these charges were incurred primarily in an effort to realign our organizational structure in europe and north america to optimize our cost structure. the charges relate to the reduction in structural costs, including a decrease in headcount and consolidation of facilities.
total expected costs associated with actions that commenced during 2015 are approximately $5 million for water infrastructure and approximately $1 million for applied water. these costs primarily comprise severance charges. the water infrastructure actions are expected to continue through the second quarter of 2016. substantially all of cost associated with the applied water actions have been incurred. as a result of these actions initiated in 2015, we achieved savings of approximately $2 million in 2015 and estimate annual future net savings beginning in 2016 of approximately $3 million, resulting in $1 million of incremental savings in 2016 from the 2015 actions.
operating income we generated operating income of $449 million during 2015, a $14 million or 3.0% decrease from the prior year. operating income as a percentage of revenue was 12.3% for 2015 versus 11.8% for 2014, an increase of 50 basis points. this increase in operating margin was primarily due to reduced restructuring and realignment costs, incremental cost savings from continuous improvement initiatives and slightly higher volume. partially offsetting these actions were cost inflation, unfavorable mix and unfavorable foreign exchange translation impacts.

nm    not meaningful water infrastructure operating income for our water infrastructure segment decreased $18 million or 5.6% (decreased $33 million or 9.4% on an adjusted basis) compared to the prior year. on an adjusted basis the operating margin decreased from 14.3% to 14.2%. the reduction in operating margin was due to cost inflation and unfavorable mix resulting from the declines in our dewatering business driven by oil and gas weakness, and lower emerging market margins. this reduction was not quite offset by cost savings from procurement initiatives, lean six sigma initiatives and restructuring actions.
applied water operating income for our applied water segment decreased $3 million or 1.6% (decreased $9 million or 4.4% on an adjusted basis) compared to the prior year. on an adjusted basis the operating margin decreased from 14.0% to 13.9%. the reduction in operating margin was due to cost inflation, unfavorable mix and foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by cost reductions from procurement and lean six sigma initiatives and higher volume.
34
corporate and other operating loss for corporate and other decreased $7 million or 13.7% (decreased $6 million or 12.0% on an adjusted basis) compared to the prior year. the reduction in adjusted operating loss was primarily due to reduced information technology and franchise tax costs.
interest expense interest expense was $55 million and $54 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily related to interest expense on $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes. refer to note 13, "credit facilities and long-term debt," for further details.
income tax expense the income tax provision for 2015 was $63 million at an effective tax rate of 15.6% compared to $84 million at an effective tax rate of 19.8% in 2014. the 2015 effective tax rate is lower than 2014 due primarily to geographic mix of earnings as well as a reduction in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded.
other comprehensive (loss) income other comprehensive loss before tax of $130 million in 2015 as compared to $284 million loss in 2014 was primarily due to a $23 million net gain in postretirement benefit plans foreign currency in 2015 as compared to a net loss of $110 million for 2014. further contributing to this decreased loss was a lower translation loss of $26 million primarily due to less weakening of the euro against the u.s. dollar largely offset by the additional weakening of the swedish krona against the u.s. dollar. additionally, there was a release of $8 million of currency translation gains out of other comprehensive (loss) income recognized as part of the sale of a business.
2014 versus 2013
revenue revenue generated for 2014 was $3,916 million, an increase of $79 million, or 2.1%, compared to $3,837 million in 2013. on a constant currency basis, revenue grew 3.3%. the following table illustrates the impact on 2014 revenue from organic growth, recent acquisitions, and fluctuations in foreign currency.

water infrastructure water infrastructure's revenue increased $58 million, or 2.4% in 2014 (4.4% on a constant currency basis). the 4.4% constant currency increase reflects growth within the industrial water and public utility end markets and $6 million of incremental revenue from our 2013 acquisitions.
organic revenue increased $99 million or 4.2% during the year, which was substantially due to higher volumes in transport, test and treatment applications. revenue from transport applications grew primarily from increased industrial dewatering applications in the united states from oil and gas market-related rental activities. transport
35
also grew organically from public utility pump and aftermarket demand. revenue from test applications increased due to significant strength in the united states from increased government spending coupled with the continued success of new products and cross-selling of our european technologies. revenue from treatment applications grew from the delivery of several large projects in the emerging markets, particularly in latin america, partially offset by lower deliverable project backlog in the united states and european markets.
applied water applied water's revenue increased $21 million, or 1.4% in 2014 (a 1.6% increase on a constant currency basis). the growth on a constant currency basis is driven primarily by organic revenue growth of $35 million, or 2.4% versus the prior year due to strength in the commercial building services, industrial water and agriculture end markets, which more than offset declines in the residential building services. the increase in the current year was partially offset by the absence of revenue from our wolverhampton valves business following its divestiture in the third quarter of 2014 as compared to $12 million of revenue for the comparative period in 2013.
organic revenue increased $35 million or 2.4% for the year due primarily to commercial building recovery in the united states institutional building market, including distributor restocking and promotional activity. also contributing to the organic growth was industrial water application strength across all regions, particularly from projects in the middle east and latin america. irrigation application revenue also grew, driven by the timing of project shipments and increased demand for vertical turbines. a decline in european demand for residential applications partially offset organic growth.
orders/backlog orders received during 2014 increased by $109 million, or 2.8% to $4,021 million (a 3.9% increase on a constant currency basis). organic order growth increased $153 million or 3.9% for the year.
water infrastructure segment orders increased $68 million, or 2.8% to $2,511 million (4.4% growth on a constant currency basis), including $8 million from acquisitions. organic order growth of 4.1% was primarily due to higher industrial demand within transport for wastewater pumps in the united states and europe as well as strength within the dewatering business for rental and equipment sales into oil and gas markets. orders for test applications also bolstered the growth for the segment from large orders in the united states. the strength in transport and test offset declines in treatment from project delays in the united states and europe.
orders increased in our applied water segment $41 million, or 2.8% to $1,510 million (3.0% growth on a constant currency basis). organic growth of 3.6% was driven by strong performance in the commercial building services and industrial water markets in the united states, as well as continued strength in china. the growth was partially offset by weakness in the residential markets of europe.
delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based upon their requirements. typically, large projects require longer lead production cycles, and delays can occur from time to time. total backlog was $740 million at december 31, 2014 and $707 million at december 31, 2013. we anticipate that more than 85% of the backlog at december 31, 2014 will be recognized as revenue during 2015.
gross margin gross margins as a percentage of consolidated revenue declined to 38.6% in 2014 from 39.1% in 2013. the decrease is primarily attributable to lower margin sales within the water infrastructure segment caused by higher mix sold to emerging markets, which have lower margins, in conjunction with foreign exchange headwinds as well as unfavorable product sales mix. these negative impacts were partially mitigated by benefits from restructuring savings and cost-saving initiatives through lean six sigma and global sourcing across both segments.

research and development expenses r&d spending was flat at $104 million or 2.7% of revenue in both 2014 and 2013.
restructuring and asset impairment charges during 2014, we incurred restructuring costs of $19 million, $6 million and $1 million in our water infrastructure and applied water segments, and corporate and other, respectively. these charges were incurred primarily in an effort to realign our organizational structure in europe and north america to optimize our cost structure. the charges relate to the reduction in structural costs, including a decrease in headcount and consolidation of facilities. during 2013, we recognized restructuring costs of $31 million and $9 million in our water infrastructure and applied water segments, respectively. these charges were incurred primarily in an effort to realign our organizational structure in europe and north america to address declines in sales volumes and optimize our cost structure. the charges relate to the reduction in structural costs, including a decrease in headcount and consolidation of facilities.
total expected costs associated with actions that commenced during 2014 are approximately $19 million for water infrastructure, approximately $6 million for applied water and approximately $1 million for corporate and other. these costs primarily comprise severance charges and the actions are substantially complete. as a result of these actions initiated in 2014, we achieved savings of approximately $13 million in 2014 and annual future net savings beginning in 2015 of approximately $26 million.
total costs associated with actions that commenced during 2013 are approximately $32 million for water infrastructure and approximately $8 million for applied water. these costs primarily comprise severance charges. these actions are substantially complete. as a result of actions initiated during 2013, we achieved net savings of approximately $13 million in 2013 and annual future net savings beginning in 2014 of approximately $36 million.
additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded a $2 million impairment charge related to three trade names in our water infrastructure segment associated with acquired businesses within our analytics operating unit, reflecting a decline in their value since being acquired. refer to note 4, "restructuring and asset impairment charges," for additional information.

operating income we generated operating income of $463 million during 2014, a $100 million or 27.5% increase from the prior year operating income of $363 million, primarily reflecting cost-saving initiatives and savings from restructuring actions. these benefits were partially offset by cost inflation combined with unfavorable impacts from our geographic and product sales mix described above. another driving factor in the year-over-year improvement was the absence of the aforementioned special charges in 2013 within sg&a, which did not recur as well as lower restructuring and realignment costs. the following table illustrates operating income results by business segments for 2014 and 2013.

water infrastructure operating income for our water infrastructure segment increased $58 million or 22.1% (increased $35 million or 11.1% on an adjusted basis) compared with the prior year. the 11.1% increase was primarily driven by higher volume, restructuring savings and cost reduction initiatives, such as global sourcing and lean six sigma. the increase was partially offset by cost inflation, unfavorable sales mix and price.
applied water operating income for our applied water segment increased $18 million or 10.3% (increased $15 million or 7.9% on an adjusted basis) compared to the prior year. the 7.9% increase was driven by lean six sigma initiatives, global sourcing and restructuring savings combined with modest price realization. the increase was partially offset by cost inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange headwinds.
corporate and other operating loss for corporate and other decreased $24 million or 32.0% (decreased $5 million or 9.1% on an adjusted basis) compared to the prior year. the reduction in adjusted operating loss was primarily due to reduced stock based compensation expense and costs associated with the corporate headquarter move in 2013 that did not recur in 2014.
interest expense interest expense was $54 million and $55 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily related to interest expense on $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes. refer to note 13, "credit facilities and long-term debt," for further details.
income tax expense the income tax provision for 2014 was $84 million at an effective tax rate of 19.8% compared to $70 million at an effective tax rate of 23.5% in 2013. the 2014 effective tax rate is lower than 2013 due primarily to geographic mix of earnings.
other comprehensive (loss) income other comprehensive loss before tax of $284 million in 2014 as compared to income of $74 million in 2013 was primarily due to a $221 million foreign currency translation impact due to a weakening of the euro, british pound and swedish krona against the u.s. dollar. further contributing to the year-over-year decline was a $110 million net loss in postretirement benefit plans in 2014 as compared to a net gain of $34 million in 2013 due to a decrease in discount rates, partially mitigated by actual gains on plan assets in excess of the assumed long-term rate of return. the effective tax rate on other comprehensive income decreased as compared to 2013 due primarily to the shift in comprehensive earnings from foreign currency translation, which is not taxable, as well as from a change in the jurisdictional mix of net gains and losses from postretirement benefit plans.
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash:

(a)   2015 and 2014 impact is primarily due to the weakness of the euro against the u.s. dollar.
sources and uses of liquidity operating activities during 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $464 million, compared to $416 million in 2014. the $48 million year-over-year increase was primarily driven by a decrease in the use of working capital from reduced inventory levels in 2015 and improved collections of receivables. lower payments for restructuring and
39
postretirement benefit plans were more than offset by increased payments for foreign value-added taxes as compared to the prior year.
during 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $416 million, compared to $324 million in 2013. the $92 million year-over-year increase was driven by an increase in income, as well as a modest improvement in working capital performance. reductions in payments made for restructuring and postretirement plan contributions in 2014 were largely offset by an increase in tax payments. also contributing to the increase was a refund of value-added tax in the current year that had been paid during 2013.
investing activities cash used in investing activities was $132 million for 2015, compared to $86 million in 2014. the increase of $46 million was primarily due to $18 million spent on an acquisition in 2015 as compared to nothing in 2014 as well as cash received in 2014 of $30 million for the sale of our wolverhampton business.
cash used in investing activities was $86 million in 2014 compared to $199 million in 2013. the decrease of $113 million was primarily driven by a decrease in acquisition activity as there were no acquisitions in 2014, whereas we spent $81 million for acquisitions during 2013. also contributing to the decrease was the receipt of $30 million in 2014 for the sale of a business. capital expenditures were also lower in 2014, with a $7 million reduction primarily due to a decrease in the spending on post spin-off information technology investments and the relocation of our corporate headquarters.
financing activities cash used by financing activities was $262 million, $147 million and $100 million during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. in 2015, the $115 million increase is primarily driven by an increase in share repurchase activity of $45 million and an increase of $8 million, or a 10% per share increase, in dividends paid to shareholders as well as a decrease in cash received from short-term debt borrowings under the european investment bank facility of $50 million. in 2014, the $47 million increase reflected cash used for share repurchase activity increasing $61 million and dividend payments increasing $7 million compared to 2013. these uses were partially offset by an increase in cash received from short-term debt borrowings under the european investment bank facility of $50 million in 2014 versus $38 million in 2013.
funding and liquidity strategy our ability to fund our capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations, and access to bank financing and the capital markets. historically, we have generated operating cash flow sufficient to fund our primary cash needs centered on operating activities, working capital, capital expenditures, and strategic investments. if our cash flows from operations are less than we expect, we may need to incur debt or issue equity. from time to time, we may need to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including: (i) our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating, (ii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets, and (iii) the current state of the economy. there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or that such financing will be available at all.
our global funding requirements are continually monitored with appropriate strategies executed to ensure liquidity needs are met cost effectively. based on our current global cash positions, cash flows from operations and access to the commercial paper markets, we believe there is sufficient liquidity to meet our funding requirements.  in addition, our existing committed credit facilities and access to the public debt markets would provide further liquidity if required.
we anticipate that our present sources of funds, including funds from operations and additional borrowings, will provide us with sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our liquidity and capital needs in both the united states and outside of the united states over the next twelve months.
senior notes on september 20, 2011, we issued 3.550% senior notes of $600 million aggregate principal amount due september 2016 (the "senior notes due 2016") and 4.875% senior notes of $600 million aggregate principal amount due october 2021 (the "senior notes due 2021" and together with the senior notes due 2016, the "senior notes").
the senior notes include covenants which restrict our ability, subject to exceptions, to incur debt secured by liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions, as well as provide for customary events of default (subject, in certain cases, to receipt of notice of default and/or customary grace and cure periods). we may redeem the senior
40
notes, as applicable, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed, plus a make-whole premium. if a change of control triggering event (as defined in the senior notes) occurs, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. as of december 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants.
interest on the senior notes due 2016 is payable on march 20 and september 20 of each year. interest on the senior notes due 2021 is payable on april 1 and october 1 of each year.
as of december 31, 2015, we have classified $600 million of our senior notes due 2016 as long-term based on our current ability and intent to refinance the outstanding borrowings on a long-term basis.
credit facility effective march 27, 2015, xylem entered into a five-year revolving credit facility with citibank, n.a., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders. the credit facility provides for an aggregate principal amount of up to $600 million of: (i) revolving extensions of credit outstanding at any time and (ii) the issuance of letters of credit in a face amount not in excess of $100 million outstanding at any time. the credit facility provides for increases of up to $200 million for a possible maximum total of $800 million in aggregate principal amount at our request and with the consent of the institutions providing such increased commitments.
at our election, the interest rate per annum applicable to the revolving loans will be based on either (i) a eurodollar rate determined by reference to libor, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, plus an applicable margin or (ii) a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to the greatest of: (a) the prime rate of citibank, n.a., (b) the u.s. federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% or (c) the eurodollar rate determined by reference to libor, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, in each case, plus an applicable margin.
in accordance with the terms, we may not exceed a maximum leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 (based on a ratio of total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) throughout the term. the credit facility also contains limitations on, among other things, incurring secured debt, granting liens, entering into sale and leaseback transactions, mergers, consolidations, liquidations, dissolutions and sales of assets. in addition, the credit facility contains other terms and conditions such as customary representations and warranties, additional covenants and customary events of default. as of december 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants.
as of december 31, 2015, the credit facility was undrawn.
research and development facility agreement on december 3, 2015, the company amended and restated its risk sharing finance facility agreement (the "r&d facility agreement") with the european investment bank (the "eib") to amend the maturity date. the facility provides an aggregate principal amount of up to €120 million (approximately $132 million) to finance research projects and infrastructure development in the european union. the company's wholly owned subsidiaries in luxembourg, xylem holdings s.á r.l. and xylem international s.á r.l., are the borrowers under the r&d facility agreement.  the obligations of the borrowers under the r&d facility agreement are guaranteed by the company under an amended and restated deed of guarantee, dated as of december 4, 2013, in favor of the eib. the funds are available during the period from 2013 through 2016 at the company's facilities in sweden, germany, italy, the united kingdom, austria, norway and hungary.
under the r&d facility agreement, the borrower can draw loans on or before march 31, 2016 with a maturity of no longer than 12 years. the r&d facility agreement provides for fixed rate loans and floating rate loans. the interest rate per annum applicable to fixed rate loans is at a fixed percentage rate per annum specified by the eib which includes the applicable margin. the interest rate per annum applicable to floating rate loans is at the rate determined by reference to euribor for loans drawn in euros and libor for loans drawn in pounds sterling or u.s. dollars, plus an applicable spread specified by the eib which includes the applicable margin. the applicable margin for both fixed rate loans and floating rate loans is determined by reference to the credit rating of the company.
in accordance with the terms of the r&d facility agreement, we may not exceed a maximum leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 (based on a ratio of total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) throughout the term. the r&d facility agreement also contains limitations on, among other things, incurring debt, granting liens, and entering into sale and leaseback transactions. in addition, the r&d facility agreement contains other terms and conditions, such as customary representations and warranties, additional covenants and customary events of default. as of december 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants.
41
as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, $76 million and $84 million was outstanding, respectively, under the r&d facility agreement. although the borrowing term for this arrangement is up to five years, we have classified it as short-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet since we intend to repay this obligation in less than a year.
non-u.s. operations for 2015 and 2014, we generated 59% and 62% of our revenue from non-u.s. operations, respectively. as we continue to grow our operations in the emerging markets and elsewhere outside of the united states, we expect to continue to generate significant revenue from non-u.s. operations and we expect our cash will be predominately held by our foreign subsidiaries. we expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. we may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the u.s. and other international subsidiaries when we believe it is cost effective to do so. we continually review our domestic and foreign cash profile, expected future cash generation and investment opportunities, which support our current designation of a portion of these funds as being indefinitely reinvested and reassess whether there is a demonstrated need to repatriate funds held internationally to support our u.s. operations. if, as a result of our review, it is determined that all or a portion of the funds may be needed for our operations in the united states, we may be required to accrue additional u.s. taxes. as of december 31, 2015, our foreign subsidiaries were holding $656 million in cash or marketable securities.
as of december 31, 2015, our excess of financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in certain foreign subsidiaries totaled $1.9 billion. we have not asserted that $41 million of our excess basis difference will be indefinitely reinvested and have therefore provided for u.s or additional foreign withholding taxes for that portion. generally, such amounts become subject to u.s. taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december 31, 2015:
(in millions)                                                       2016          2017 - 2018          2019 - 2020           thereafter               total debt and capital lease obligations (1)                          $678                 $-                   $-                 $600                $1,278

total commitments                                               $869               $144                 $104                 $656                $1,773
in addition to the amounts presented in the table above, we have recorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $47 million, net investment hedges of $18 million and employee severance indemnity of $13 million. these amounts have been excluded from the contractual obligations table due to an inability to reasonably estimate the timing or amounts of such payments in individual years. further, benefit payments which reflect expected future service related to the company's pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations are presented in note 14, "postretirement benefit plans" of the consolidated financial statements and not included in the above table. finally, estimated environmental payments and workers' compensation and general liability reserves are excluded from the table above. we estimate, based on historical experience, that we will spend approximately $1 million to $2 million per year on environmental investigation and remediation and approximately $4 million to $5 million per year on workers' compensation and general liability. at december 31, 2015, we had estimated and accrued $4 million and $24 million related to environmental matters, and workers' compensation and general liability, respectively.
(1)   refer to note 13, "credit facilities and long-term debt," of the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the use and availability of debt and revolving credit agreements. amounts represent principal payments of long-term debt including current maturities and exclude unamortized discounts. as of december 31, 2015, we have classified $600 million of our senior notes due 2016 as long-term based on our current ability and intent to refinance the outstanding borrowings on a long-term basis, however, we cannot reasonably estimate the future debt terms and interest payments.
(2)   amounts represent estimates of future interest payments on long-term debt outstanding as of december 31, 2015.
(3)   represents unconditional purchase agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms to purchase goods or services, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. purchase agreements that are able to cancel without penalty have been excluded.
42
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2015, we have issued guarantees for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries in the normal course of business. we have determined that none of these arrangements has a material current effect or is reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our consolidated financial statements, financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
we obtain certain stand-by letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds from third-party financial institutions in the ordinary course of business when required under contracts or to satisfy insurance related requirements. as of december 31, 2015, the amount of stand-by letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds was $161 million.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed in note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies," of the consolidated financial statements. accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they are inherently uncertain, involve significant judgments, include areas where different estimates reasonably could have been used, and changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results in these areas could differ from management's estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
revenue recognition. we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured. for product sales, delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped, risk of loss has been transferred to the customer and the contractual terms have been fulfilled. in instances where contractual terms include a provision for customer acceptance, revenue is recognized when either (i) we have previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria based on either seller- or customer-specified objective criteria or (ii) upon formal acceptance received from the customer where the product has not been previously demonstrated to meet customer-specified objective criteria. revenue on service and repair contracts is recognized after services have been agreed to by the customer and rendered.
we enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, certain agreements contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. where sales agreements contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions, judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and, if so, how the transaction price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. when a sale involves multiple deliverables, the total revenue from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of the deliverable to all other deliverables in the contract. revenue for multiple element arrangements is recognized when the appropriate revenue recognition criteria for the individual deliverable have been satisfied. the allocation of sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition, but will not change the total revenue recognized on the arrangement. for delivered elements accounted for as separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement, revenue is recognized only when the delivered elements have standalone value, there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance and there are no customer-negotiated refund or return rights affecting the sales recognized.
certain businesses enter into long-term construction-type sales contracts for which revenue is recognized under the percentage-of-completion method based upon percentage of costs incurred to total estimated costs.
we record a reduction in revenue at the time of sale for estimated product returns, rebates and other allowances, based on historical experience and known trends.
income taxes. deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which
43
we expect the differences will reverse. based on the evaluation of available evidence, we recognize future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not we will realize these benefits. we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes to our estimate of the amount we are more likely than not to realize in the valuation allowance, with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income, as appropriate.
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback years and the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income. the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates.
our effective tax rate reflects the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided u.s. taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states. we plan foreign earnings remittance amounts based on projected cash flow needs, as well as the working capital and long-term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations. based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount we will distribute to the united states and provide the u.s. federal taxes due on these amounts. material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact our effective tax rate.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the u.s. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and to the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. furthermore, we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
we adjust our liability for uncertain tax positions in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional tax expense would result. if a payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
goodwill and intangible assets. we review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. we also review the carrying value of our finite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment when impairment indicators arise. we conduct our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter. we perform a two-step impairment test for goodwill. in the first step, we compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to measure the impairment loss to be recorded, if any. if the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference. in our annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets, we compare the fair value of those assets to their carrying value. we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. we estimate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives using an income approach. under the income approach, we calculate fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows.
determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, particularly related to future operating results and cash flows. these estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, assumed royalty rates, future economic and market conditions and identification of appropriate market comparable data. in addition, the identification of reporting units and the allocation of assets and liabilities to the reporting units when determining the carrying value of each reporting unit also require judgment. goodwill is tested for impairment at either the operating segment identified in note 20, "segment and geographic data," of the consolidated financial statements, or one level below. the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets is based on estimates and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. significant changes to these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact our conclusions. actual future results may differ from those estimates.

during the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed our annual impairment assessment and determined that the estimated fair values of our goodwill reporting units were substantially in excess of each of their carrying values. however, future goodwill impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings. we will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment. we determined that no impairment of the indefinite-lived intangibles existed as of the measurement date in 2015.
contingent liabilities. as discussed in note 18, "commitments and contingencies" of the consolidated financial statements, the company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation, environmental liabilities, product liabilities, and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). the company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims. in addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to various factors, including those discussed in note 18 of the consolidated financial statements. if the liabilities established by the company with respect to these contingencies are inadequate, the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the recorded liability, which would adversely affect the company's financial statements.
receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts and discounts. receivables primarily comprise uncollected amounts owed to us from transactions with customers and are presented net of allowances for doubtful accounts and early payment discounts.
we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts using a combination of factors to reduce our trade receivable balances to their estimated net realizable amount. we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due, macroeconomic trends and conditions, significant one-time events, historical experience and the financial condition of customers. in addition, we record a specific reserve for individual accounts when we become aware of specific customer circumstances, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position. the past due or delinquency status of a receivable is based on the contractual payment terms of the receivable. if circumstances related to the specific customer change, we adjust estimates of the recoverability of receivables as appropriate. we determine our allowance for early payment discounts primarily based on historical experience with customers.
credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different geographical regions. we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our third-party distributors, resellers and other customers and require collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, in certain circumstances. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014 we do not believe we have any significant concentrations of credit risk.
postretirement plans. company employees around the world participate in numerous defined benefit plans. the determination of projected benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to these plans are dependent on various assumptions. these major assumptions primarily relate to discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, mortality, health care inflation and years of service (some of which are disclosed in note 14, "postretirement benefit plans," of the consolidated financial statements) and other factors. actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized on a straight-line basis only to the extent they exceed 10% of the higher of the market-related value or projected benefit obligation, over the average remaining service period of active plan participants, or for plans with all or substantially all inactive participants, over the average remaining life expectancy.

significant assumptions management develops each assumption using relevant company experience, in conjunction with market-related data for each individual country in which such plans exist. all assumptions are reviewed annually with third-party consultants and adjusted as necessary. the table included below provides the weighted average assumptions used to estimate our defined benefit pension obligations and costs as of and for the years ended 2015 and 2014.

nm   not meaningful. the pension benefits for future service for all the u.s. pension plans are based on years of service and not impacted by future compensation increases.
we determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and estimates of future returns. specifically, the company analyzes the estimated future returns based on independent estimates of asset class returns and evaluates historical broad market returns over long-term timeframes based on the strategic asset allocation, which is detailed in note 14, "postretirement benefit plans," of the consolidated financial statements.
based on the approach described above, the chart below shows weighted average actual returns versus the weighted average expected long-term rates of return for our pension plans that were utilized in the calculation of the net periodic pension cost for each respective year.
2015                                                                 2014          2013
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets   7.38   %      7.38   %      7.40   %
actual rate of return on plan assets               3.51   %     18.13   %     10.17   %
for the recognition of net periodic pension cost, the calculation of the expected return on plan assets is generally derived by applying the expected long-term rate of return to the market-related value of plan assets. the market-related value of plan assets is based on average asset values at the measurement date over the last five years. the use of fair value, rather than a calculated value, could materially affect net periodic pension cost. the weighted average expected long-term rate of return for all of our plan assets to be used in determining net periodic benefit costs for 2016 is estimated at 7.32%. we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets impacts the expense by $1 million.
the discount rate reflects our expectation of the present value of expected future cash payments for benefits at the measurement date. a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. we base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields of high-quality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period. the pension discount rate was determined by considering an interest rate yield curve comprising aaa/aa bonds, with maturities between zero and 30 years, developed by the plan's actuaries. annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield curve to develop a single-point discount rate matching the plan's characteristics. our weighted average discount rate for all pension plans effective january 1, 2016, is 3.53%. we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the expense by $1 million.
the rate of future compensation increase assumption reflects our long-term actual experience and future and near-term outlook. effective january 1, 2016, our expected rate of future compensation is 3.29% for all pension plans. the estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of future compensation is less than $1 million.
the assumed rate of future increases in the per capita cost of health care (the health care trend rate) is 7.00% for 2016, decreasing ratably to 4.50% in 2027. an increase or decrease in the health care trend rates by one percent per year would impact the aggregate annual service and interest components by less than $1 million, and impact the benefit obligation by approximately $4 million.
46
we currently anticipate making contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans in the range of $26 million to $36 million during 2016, of which $8 million is expected to be made in the first quarter.
funded status funded status is derived by subtracting the respective year-end values of the projected benefit obligations from the fair value of plan assets. we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the funded status by approximately $26 million.
fair value of plan assets the plan assets of our pension plans comprise a broad range of investments, including domestic and foreign equity securities, interests in private equity and hedge funds, fixed income investments, insurance contracts, and cash and cash equivalents.
a portion of our pension benefit plan assets portfolio comprises investments in private equity and hedge funds. the private equity and hedge fund investments are generally measured at net asset value. however, in certain instances, the values reported by the asset managers were not current at the measurement date. accordingly, we made estimate adjustments to the last reported value where necessary to measure the assets at fair value at the measurement date. these adjustments consider information received from the asset managers, as well as general market information. the adjustment recorded at december 31, 2015 and 2014 for these assets represented less than one percent of total plan assets in each respective year. asset values for other positions were generally measured using market observable prices. we estimate that a 5% change in asset values will impact funded status by approximately $25 million.

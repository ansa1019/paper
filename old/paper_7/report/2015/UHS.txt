item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

overview our principal business is owning and operating, through our subsidiaries, acute care hospitals, behavioral health centers, surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers. as of february 25, 2016, we owned and/or operated 24 inpatient acute care hospitals, 3 free-standing emergency departments and 213 inpatient and 16 outpatient behavioral health care facilities located in 37 states, washington, d.c., the united kingdom, puerto rico and the u.s. virgin islands. in addition, we are building a newly-constructed acute care hospital located in henderson, nevada, that is scheduled to be completed and opened during the fourth quarter of 2016. we also manage and/or own outright or in partnerships with physicians, 4 surgical hospitals and surgery and radiation oncology centers located in 4 states.
as a percentage of our consolidated net revenues, net revenues from our acute care hospitals, surgical hospitals, commercial health insurer, surgery centers and radiation oncology centers accounted for 51% during each of 2015 and 2014 and 49% during 2013.  net revenues from our behavioral health care operations accounted for 49% of our consolidated net revenues during each of 2015 and 2014 and 51% during 2013.
services provided by our hospitals include general and specialty surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services, pharmacy services and/or behavioral health services. we provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities, including central purchasing, information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.
forward-looking statements and risk factors you should carefully review the information contained in this annual report, and should particularly consider any risk factors that we set forth in this annual report and in other reports or documents that we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission (the "sec"). in this annual report, we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance. this annual report contains "forward-looking statements" that reflect our current estimates, expectations and projections about our future results, performance, prospects and opportunities. forward-looking statements include, among other things, the information concerning our possible future results of operations, business and growth strategies, financing plans, expectations that regulatory developments or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, our competitive position and the effects of competition, the projected growth of the industry in which we operate, and the benefits and synergies to be obtained from our completed and any future acquisitions, and statements of our goals and objectives, and other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. words such as "may," "will," "should," "could," "would," "predicts," "potential," "continue," "expects," "anticipates," "future," "intends," "plans," "believes," "estimates," "appears," "projects" and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements. in evaluating those statements, you should specifically consider various factors, including the risks related to healthcare industry trends and those set forth herein in item 1a. risk factors.
forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved. forward-looking information is based on information available at the time and/or our good faith belief with respect to future events, and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. such factors include, among other things, the following:
·   our ability to comply with the existing laws and government regulations, and/or changes in laws and government regulations;

·   an increasing number of legislative initiatives have been passed into law that may result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or state level. no assurances can be given that the implementation of these laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations;

·   possible unfavorable changes in the levels and terms of reimbursement for our charges by third party payors or government based payors, including medicare or medicaid in the united states, and government based payors in the united kingdom;

·   our ability to enter into managed care provider agreements on acceptable terms and the ability of our competitors to do the same, including contracts with united/sierra healthcare in las vegas, nevada;

·   the outcome of known and unknown litigation, government investigations, false claim act allegations, and liabilities and other claims asserted against us and other matters as disclosed in item 3. legal proceedings;

37
·   the potential unfavorable impact on our business of deterioration in national, regional and local economic and business conditions, including a worsening of unfavorable credit market conditions;

·   competition from other healthcare providers (including physician owned facilities) in certain markets;

·   technological and pharmaceutical improvements that increase the cost of providing, or reduce the demand for healthcare;

·   our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, nurses, physicians and other healthcare professionals and the impact on our labor expenses resulting from a shortage of nurses and other healthcare professionals;

·   demographic changes;

·   our ability to successfully integrate and improve our recent acquisitions and the availability of suitable acquisitions and divestiture opportunities;

·   as discussed below in sources of revenue, we receive revenues from various state and county based programs, including medicaid in all the states in which we operate, (we receive medicaid revenues in excess of $90 million annually from each of texas, washington, d.c., california, nevada, illinois, pennsylvania, virginia, massachusetts and florida); cms-approved medicaid supplemental programs in certain states including texas, illinois, oklahoma, mississippi, california, ohio and arkansas, and; state medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments in certain states including texas and south carolina. we are therefore particularly sensitive to potential reductions in medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states. we can provide no assurance that reductions to revenues earned pursuant to these programs, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations;

·   our ability to continue to obtain capital on acceptable terms, including borrowed funds, to fund the future growth of our business;

·   some of our acute care facilities experience decreasing inpatient admission trends;

·   our financial statements reflect large amounts due from various commercial and private payors and there can be no assurance that failure of the payors to remit amounts due to us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations;

·   in march, 2010, the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 and the patient protection and affordable care act were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for u.s. citizens as well as material revisions to the federal medicare and state medicaid programs. the two combined primary goals of these acts are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses. medicare, medicaid and other health care industry changes are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade. we cannot predict the effect, if any, these enactments will have on our future results of operations;

·   the department of health and human services ("hhs") published final regulations in july, 2010 implementing the health information technology ("hit") provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act (referred to as the "hitech act"). the final regulation defines the "meaningful use" of electronic health records ("ehr") and establishes the requirements for the medicare and medicaid ehr payment incentive programs. the implementation period for these new medicare and medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for medicare and 2021 for the state medicaid programs. hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of ehr by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the inpatient prospective payment system ("ipps") standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year. we believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria and therefore were not subject to a reduced market basked update to the ipps standardized amount in federal fiscal year 2015. however, under the hitech act, hospitals must continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year. failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations. there will likely be timing differences in the recognition of the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of the ehr applications which may cause material period-to-period changes in our future results of operations;

38
·   in august, 2011, the budget control act of 2011 (the "2011 act") was enacted into law. the 2011 act imposed annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the congressional budget office. among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan congressional committee, known as the joint select committee on deficit reduction (the "joint committee"), which was tasked with making recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years. the joint committee was unable to reach an agreement by the november 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and medicare spending were implemented on march 1, 2013 resulting in medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year (annual reduction of approximately $36 million to our medicare net revenues) with a uniform percentage reduction across all medicare programs. the bipartisan budget act of 2015, enacted on november 2, 2015, continued the 2% reductions to medicare reimbursement imposed under the 2011 act. we cannot predict whether congress will restructure the implemented medicare payment reductions or what other federal budget deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by congress going forward;

·   our accounts receivable as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 include amounts due from illinois of approximately $28 million and $44 million, respectively. collection of the outstanding receivables continues to be delayed due to state budgetary and funding pressures. approximately $12 million as of december 31, 2015 and $23 million as of december 31, 2014, of the receivables due from illinois were outstanding in excess of 60 days, as of each respective date. in addition, our accounts receivable as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 includes approximately $80 million and $102 million, respectively, due from texas in connection with medicaid supplemental payment programs. the $80 million due from texas as of december 31, 2015 consists of $47 million related to uncompensated care program revenues, $9 million related to disproportionate share hospital program revenues and $24 million related to delivery service reform incentive payment program ("dsrip") revenues. the above-mentioned texas dsrip receivables outstanding as of december 31, 2015 were collected in january, 2016. although the accounts receivable due from illinois and texas could remain outstanding for the foreseeable future, since we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us, no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements. however, we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from illinois and/or texas. failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due from these states would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows;

·   there have been several attempts in congress to repeal or modify various provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act (the "ppaca"). we cannot predict whether or not any of these proposed changes to the ppaca will become law and therefore can provide no assurance that changes to the ppaca, as currently implemented, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations;

·   uninsured and self-pay patients treated at our acute care facilities unfavorably impact our ability to satisfactorily and timely collect our self-pay patient accounts;

·   the ability to obtain adequate levels of general and professional liability insurance on current terms;

·   changes in our business strategies or development plans;

·   fluctuations in the value of our common stock, and;

·   other factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
a summary of our significant accounting policies is outlined in note 1 to the financial statements. we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements, including the following:
39
revenue recognition: we record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided. medicare and medicaid revenues represented 35% of our net patient revenues during 2015, 38% during 2014 and 39% during 2013. revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed medicare and medicaid programs accounted for 52% of our net patient revenues during 2015, 50% during 2014 and 49% during 2013.
we report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third-party payors and others for services rendered. we have agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates. payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges and per diem payments. estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. we closely monitor our historical collection rates, as well as changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations and contract terms, to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available. however, due to the complexities involved in these estimations, actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record.
we estimate our medicare and medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information, patient utilization data, government provided data and in accordance with applicable medicare and medicaid payment rules and regulations. the laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term. certain types of payments by the medicare program and state medicaid programs (e.g. medicare disproportionate share hospital, medicare allowable bad debts and inpatient psychiatric services) are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements. such amounts are included in accounts receivable, net, on our consolidated balance sheets. the funding of both federal medicare and state medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes. as such, we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations, if enacted, will not have a material impact on our future medicare and medicaid reimbursements. adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2015, 2014 and 2013. if it were to occur, each 1% adjustment to our estimated net medicare revenues that are subject to retrospective review and settlement as of december 31, 2015, would change our after-tax net income by approximately $1 million.
we provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates. because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net. see additional disclosure below in charity care, uninsured discounts and provision for doubtful accounts for our estimated uncompensated care provided and estimated cost of providing uncompensated care.
charity care, uninsured discounts and provision for doubtful accounts: collection of receivables from third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient's responsibility, primarily co-payments and deductibles. we estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience. we routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted. at our acute care hospitals, third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account. for those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients, the patient receives statements and collection letters. our hospitals establish a partial reserve for self-pay accounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts for both unbilled balances and those that have been billed and are under 90 days old. all self-pay accounts are fully reserved at 90 days from the date of discharge. third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge. patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of financial assistance including our charity care policy. if the patient is deemed unwilling to pay, the account is written-off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort.
historically, a significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients which, in part, has resulted from patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high deductibles. patients treated at our hospitals for non-elective services, who have gross income less than 400% of the federal poverty guidelines, are deemed eligible for charity care. the federal poverty guidelines are established by the federal government and are based on income and family size. because we do not pursue collection of amounts that qualify as charity care, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable, net.
a portion of the accounts receivable at our acute care facilities are comprised of medicaid accounts that are pending approval from third-party payers but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payers such as county indigent programs in certain states. our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patient's responsible party at the time of registration. at that time, an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned. there are various pre-established insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered. certain patients may be classified as medicaid pending at
40
registration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently medicaid eligible. when a patient is registered as medicaid eligible or medicaid pending, our patient accounting system records net revenues for services provided to that patient based upon the established medicaid reimbursement rates, subject to the ultimate disposition of the patient's medicaid eligibility. when the patient's ultimate eligibility is determined, reclassifications may occur which impacts the reported amounts in future periods for the provision for doubtful accounts and other accounts such as medicaid pending. although the patient's ultimate eligibility determination may result in amounts being reclassified among these accounts from period to period, these reclassifications did not have a material impact on our results of operations in 2015, 2014 or 2013 since our facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible.
we also provide discounts to uninsured patients (included in "uninsured discounts" amounts below) who do not qualify for medicaid or charity care. because we do not pursue collection of amounts classified as uninsured discounts, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our net accounts receivable. in implementing the discount policy, we first attempt to qualify uninsured patients for governmental programs, charity care or any other discount program. if an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied. effective january 1, 2014, in response to market conditions and other considerations, we modified our uninsured discount policy and increased the discount to 60% of gross charges from 30% previously. since we expect to collect only a small portion of amounts due from our uninsured patients, the increase in the uninsured discount as of january 1, 2014 had no material impact on our 2015 and 2014 net revenues, net income attributable to uhs or net accounts receivable, as compared to 2013. however, this change resulted in an increase in uninsured discounts and a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts. our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $399 million and $325 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
approximately 85% during 2015 and 84% during 2014 of our consolidated provision for doubtful accounts, was incurred by our acute care hospitals. shown below is our payer mix concentrations and related aging of our billed accounts receivable, net of contractual allowances, for our acute care hospitals as of december 31, 2015 and 2014:

accounting for medicare and medicaid electronic health records incentive payments: in july 2010, the department of health and human services published final regulations implementing the health information technology provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act. the regulation defines the "meaningful use" of electronic health records ("ehr") and established the requirements for the medicare and medicaid ehr payment incentive programs. the implementation period for these new medicare and medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for medicare and 2021 for the state medicaid programs. we recognize income related to medicare and medicaid incentive payments using a gain contingency model that is based upon when our eligible hospitals have demonstrated "meaningful use" of certified ehr technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the incentive payment is available.
medicare ehr incentive payments: federal regulations require that medicare ehr incentive payments be computed based on the medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable "meaningful use" requirements. since the annual medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on december 31st, we will
41
recognize medicare ehr incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the "meaningful use" criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year.
medicaid ehr incentive payments: medicaid ehr incentive payments are determined based upon prior period cost report information available at the time our hospitals met the "meaningful use" criteria. therefore, the majority of the medicaid ehr incentive income recognition occurred in the period in which the applicable hospitals were deemed to have met initial "meaningful use" criteria. upon meeting subsequent fiscal year "meaningful use" criteria, our hospitals may become entitled to additional medicaid ehr incentive payments which will be recognized as incentive income in future periods. medicaid ehr incentive payments received prior to our hospitals meeting the "meaningful use" criteria were included in other current liabilities (as deferred ehr incentive income) in our consolidated balance sheet.
self-insured/other insurance risks: we provide for self-insured risks, primarily general and professional liability claims and workers' compensation claims. our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies. all relevant information, including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims. while we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate. our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense. in addition, we also: (i) own commercial health insurers headquartered in reno, nevada, and puerto rico and; (ii) maintain self-insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims. the ultimate costs related to these programs/operations include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported. given our significant insurance-related exposure, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements-commitments and contingencies, for additional disclosure related to our professional and general liability, workers' compensation liability and property insurance.
long-lived assets: we review our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow. if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized. fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.
goodwill and intangible assets: goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise. our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit.  during the quarter ended september 30, 2015, we changed our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles testing date from september 1st to october 1st. management believes that this voluntary change in accounting method is preferable as it aligns the annual impairment testing date with our annual budgeting process.  in connection with this change, we first performed an impairment test as of september 1, 2015, which indicated no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.  we performed an additional impairment test as of october 1, 2015 which also indicated no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. there were also no impairments during 2014 or 2013. the 2015 change in annual testing date does not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge. future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including profitability and market value projections, could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write-off of a portion or all of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.
income taxes: deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. we believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carry-forwards.
we operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws. we are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities. our tax returns have been examined by the internal revenue service ("irs") through the year ended december 31, 2006. we believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal, foreign and state taxes.

acute care hospital services-same facility basis we believe that providing our results on a "same facility" basis, which includes the operating results for facilities and businesses operated in both the current year and prior year periods, is helpful to our investors as a measure of our operating performance. our same facility results also neutralize the impact of the ehr applications, the effect of items that are non-operational in nature including items such as, but not limited to, gains on sales of assets and businesses, impacts of settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits and other amounts that may be reflected in the current or prior year financial statements that relate to prior periods. our same facility basis results reflected on the tables below also exclude from net revenues and other operating expenses, provider tax assessments incurred in each period as discussed below sources of revenue-various state medicaid supplemental payment programs. however, these provider tax assessments are included in net revenues and other operating expenses as reflected in the table below under all acute care hospitals. the provider tax assessments had no impact on the income before income taxes as reflected on the tables below since the amounts offset between net revenues and other operating expenses.

the provision for doubtful accounts at our acute care hospitals was approximately $631 million during 2015, $590 million during 2014 and $1.02 billion during 2013. the decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts during 2014, as compared to 2013, was primarily due to the increase in the uninsured discount (effective january 1, 2014, as discussed above in charity care, uninsured discounts and provision for doubtful accounts), and reclassifications among provision for doubtful accounts and other accounts such as medicaid pending based upon our patients' ultimate eligibility determination, as discussed above.
the estimated cost of providing uncompensated care:
the estimated cost of providing uncompensated care, as reflected below, were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the above-mentioned total uncompensated care amounts. the percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based on the total operating expenses for our acute care facilities divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities. an increase in the level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in the provision for doubtful accounts and uncompensated care provided could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results.

on a same facility basis during 2014, as compared to 2013, net revenues at our acute care hospitals increased $355 million or 10%. income before income taxes increased $207 million or 75% to $484 million or 12.3% of net revenues during 2014 as compared to $277 million or 7.8% of net revenues during 2013.
the increased income before income taxes experienced at our acute care facilities during 2014, as compared to 2013, was due in part to improved general economic conditions as well as a decrease in the number of uninsured patients treated at our hospitals. the decrease in the number of uninsured patients treated at our acute care hospitals was due primarily to the favorable impact of the affordable care act which included the expansion of medicaid in certain states in which we operate and the enrollment of patients in newly created commercial exchanges.
inpatient admissions to these facilities increased 0.6% during 2014, as compared to 2013, while patient days increased 3.9%. adjusted admissions increased 3.1% and adjusted patient days increased 6.5% during 2014, as compared to 2013. the average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 4.7 days during 2014 and 4.5 days during 2013. the occupancy rate, based on the average

available beds at these facilities, was 58% during 2014 and 56% during 2013. on a same facility basis, net revenue per adjusted admission at these facilities increased 6.6% during 2014, as compared to 2013, and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 3.3% during 2014, as compared to 2013.
all acute care hospital services the following table summarizes the results of operations for all our acute care operations during 2014 and 2013. these amounts include our acute care results on a same facility basis (as indicated above), the impact of provider tax assessments which increased net revenues and other operating expenses but had no impact on income before income taxes, as well as the impact of other items as mentioned below (dollar amounts in thousands).

during 2014, as compared to 2013, net revenues at our acute care hospitals increased $575 million or 16% to $4.18 billion due primarily to: (i) a $355 million, or 10%, increase same facility revenues, as discussed above, and; (ii) other combined net increase of $220 million consisting primarily of the net revenues generated during 2014 related to the acquisition of a commercial health insurer and a full year of net revenues generated during 2014 at temecula valley hospital, a 140-bed acute care facility that was completed and opened during the fourth quarter of 2013.
income before income taxes increased $123 million to $465 million or 11.1% of net revenues during 2014 as compared to $342 million or 9.5% of net revenues during 2013.
included in these results are the following:
·   the $207 million increase in income before income taxes experienced during 2014, as compared to 2013, at our acute care hospital services, on a same facility basis, as discussed above;

·   a net decrease of $52 million net increase resulting from reductions to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves attributable to our acute care hospitals recorded during 2014 ($11 million) and 2013 ($63 million);

·   a net decrease of $27 million related to the incentive income ($28 million in 2014 and $61 million in 2013), net of related expenses ($37 million in 2014 and $43 million in 2013), recorded in connection with the implementation of ehr applications at our acute care hospitals, and;

during 2015, as compared to 2014, net revenues at our behavioral health care facilities increased 10% or $388 million to $4.40 billion during 2015 as compared to $4.01 billion during 2014. the increase in net revenues was attributable to: (i) $195 million or 5% increase in same facility revenues, as discussed above, and; (ii) $193 million of other combined increases consisting primarily of the revenues generated at the 21 behavioral health care facilities acquired in the u.k. since september of 2014.
income before income taxes increased $78 million or 8% to $1.02 billion or 23.2% of net revenues during 2015 as compared to $944 million or 23.5% of net revenues during 2014. the increase in income before income taxes at our behavioral health facilities was attributable to:
·   a $54 million increase at our behavioral health facilities on a same facility basis, as discussed above;

·   a combined net increase of $33 million related primarily to the income generated at the 21 behavioral health care facilities acquired in the u.k. since september of 2014, and;

·   a $9 million net decrease resulting from the reduction to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves applicable to our behavioral health facilities recorded during 2014.

sources of revenue overview: we receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the medicare program, state governments under their respective medicaid programs and directly from patients.
hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the medical and ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services. charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient routine services vary depending on the type of services provided (e.g., medical/surgical, intensive care or behavioral health) and the geographic location of the hospital. inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our control. the percentage of patient service revenue attributable to outpatient services has generally increased in recent years, primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis, as well as increased pressure from medicare, medicaid and private insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services, where possible, on a less expensive outpatient basis. we believe that our experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues.
53
patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under medicare, medicaid, some private insurance plans, and managed care plans, but are responsible for services not covered by such plans, exclusions, deductibles or co-insurance features of their coverage. the amount of such exclusions, deductibles and co-insurance has generally been increasing each year. indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue. collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or business payers which unfavorably impacts the collectability of our patient accounts.
the following tables show the approximate percentages of net patient revenue during the past three years for: (i) our acute care and behavioral health care facilities combined; (ii) our acute care facilities, and; (iii) our behavioral health care facilities. net patient revenue is defined as revenue from all sources after deducting contractual allowances and discounts from established billing rates, which we derived from various sources of payment for the years indicated.

medicare: medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged 65 and over, some disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease. all of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of medicare services by the appropriate governmental authorities. amounts received under the medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospital's customary charges for services provided. since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the medicare program, our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program.
under the medicare program, for inpatient services, our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective payment system ("ipps"). under the ipps, hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge. the fixed payment amount is based upon each patient's medicare severity diagnosis related group ("ms-drg"). every ms-drg is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis. the ms-drg payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care. this ms-drg assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each ms-drg. the ms-drg and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity. while we generally will not receive payment from medicare for inpatient services, other than the ms-drg payment, a
54
hospital may qualify for an "outlier" payment if a particular patient's treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold.
ms-drg rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year, which begins on october 1. the index used to adjust the ms-drg rates, known as the "hospital market basket index," gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services. generally, however, the percentage increases in the ms-drg payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals.
in july, 2015, cms published its ipps 2016 final payment rule which provides for a 2.4% market basket increase to the base medicare ms-drg blended rate. when statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and health care reform mandated adjustments are considered, without consideration for the decreases related to the required medicare disproportionate share hospital ("dsh") payment changes and decrease to the medicare outlier threshold, the overall increase in ipps payments would approximate 1.1%. including the estimated decreases to our medicare disproportionate share hospital ("dsh") payments (approximating 1.6%), we estimate our overall decrease from the final ipps 2016 rule (covering the period of october 1, 2015 through september 30, 2016) will approximate -0.1%. this projected impact from the ipps 2016 final rule includes both the impact of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 documentation and coding adjustment and the required changes to the dsh payments related to the traditional medicare fee for service, however, it excludes the impact of the sequestration reductions related to the budget control act of 2011, and bipartisan budget act of 2015, as discussed below.
in august, 2014, cms published its ipps 2015 payment rule which provides for a 2.9% market basket increase to the base medicare ms-drg blended rate. when statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and health care reform mandated adjustments are considered, without consideration for the decreases related to the required dsh payment changes and increase to the medicare outlier threshold, the overall increase in ipps payments would approximate 0.6%. including the estimated decreases to our dsh payments (-1.9%) and medicare outlier threshold (-0.6%), we estimate our overall decrease from the ipps 2015 rule (covering the period of october 1, 2014 through september 30, 2015) will approximate (-1.9%), or approximately $13 million annually. this projected impact from the ipps 2015 rule includes both the impact of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 documentation and coding adjustment and the required changes to the dsh payments related to the traditional medicare fee for service, however, it excludes the impact of the sequestration reductions related to the budget control act of 2011, as discussed below.
in august, 2013, cms published its final ipps 2014 payment rule which provided for a 2.5% market basket increase to the base medicare ms-drg blended rate. when statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and health care reform mandated adjustments are considered, we estimate our overall increase from the final federal fiscal year 2014 rule (covering the period of october 1, 2013 through september 30, 2014) approximated 1.0%. this projected impact from the ipps 2014 final rule includes both the impact of the atra of 2012 documentation and coding adjustment and the required changes to the dsh payments related to the traditional medicare fee for service, however, it excludes the impact of the sequestration reductions related to the budget control act of 2011, as discussed below. the final rule also expands cms's policy under which it defines inpatient admissions to include the use of an objective time of care standard. specifically, it would require medicare's external review contractors to presume that hospital inpatient admissions are reasonable and necessary when beneficiaries receive a physician order for admission and receive medically necessary services for at least two midnights (the "two midnight" rule). correspondingly, under the final rule, cms presumes that hospital services spanning less than two midnights should have been provided on an outpatient basis and paid under medicare part b unless the medical record contains clear documentation supporting the physician's order and an expectation that the medicare beneficiary would need medically necessary care for more than two midnights, or is receiving services which cms designates as inpatient only. our acute care hospitals have begun to comply with the two midnight rule and, although we are unable to determine the ultimate impact at this time, its application could have a material unfavorable impact on our future results of operations. excluding the potential impact of the two midnight rule, the final ipps 2014 payment rule did not have a material impact on our results of operations. in april, 2015, congress voted to extend an enforcement moratorium on the two midnight rule through the end of fiscal year 2015. although the prohibition of recovery auditor patient status reviews expired on october 1, 2015, cms did not approve recovery auditors to conduct patient status reviews for admission dates through december 31, 2015.
in october, 2015 as part of the 2016 medicare outpatient prospective payment system ("opps") final rule (additional related disclosure below), cms proposes to allow payment for one-midnight stays under the medicare part a benefit on a case-by case basis for rare and unusual exceptions based the presence of certain clinical factors. cms also announced in the final rule that, effective october 1, 2015, quality improvement organizations ("qios") will conduct reviews of short inpatient stay reviews rather than medicare administrative contractors ("macs"). additionally, cms also announced that racs resumed patient status reviews for claims with admission dates of january 1, 2016 or later, and the agency indicates that racs will conduct these reviews focused on providers with high denial rates that are referred by the qios.

in august, 2011, the budget control act of 2011 (the "2011 act") was enacted into law. included in this law are the imposition of annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the congressional budget office. among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan congressional committee, known as the joint committee, which was responsible for developing recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years. the joint committee was unable to reach an agreement by the november 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and medicare spending were implemented on march 1, 2013 resulting in medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year.  the bipartisan budget act of 2015, enacted on november 2, 2015, continued the 2% reductions to medicare reimbursement imposed under the 2011 act.  for federal fiscal year 2015, the aggregate annual sequestration reduction to our medicare net revenues was approximately $36 million with a uniform percentage reduction across all medicare programs.
on january 2, 2013 atra was enacted which, among other things, includes a requirement for cms to recoup $11 billion from hospitals from medicare ipps rates during federal fiscal years 2014 to 2017. the recoupment relates to ipps documentation and coding adjustments for the period 2008 to 2013 for which adjustments were not previously applied by cms. both the 2014 and 2015 ipps final rules include a -0.8% recoupment adjustment. cms has included the same 0.8% recoupment adjustment in fiscal year 2016 and expects to make similar adjustment in federal fiscal year 2017 in order to recover the entire $11 billion. this adjustment is reflected in the 2014, 2015 and 2016 ipps estimated impact amounts noted above. on april 16, 2015, the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 was enacted and an anticipated 3.2% payment increase in 2018 is scheduled to be phased in at 0.5% per year over 6 years beginning in fiscal year 2018.
on january 1, 2005, cms implemented a new psychiatric prospective payment system ("psych pps") for inpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the medicare program. this system replaced the cost-based reimbursement guidelines with a per diem psych pps with adjustments to account for certain facility and patient characteristics. the psych pps also contained provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospital's base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department. in august, 2012, cms published its final psych pps rate notice for the federal fiscal year beginning october 1, 2012. that final notice contained a psych pps market basket update of 2.7%, which was reduced by 0.7% to reflect a productivity adjustment, and reduced by 0.1% to reflect an "other adjustment" required by the social security act for rate years 2010 through 2019. in july, 2013, cms released its final psych pps rate notice for the federal fiscal year 2014. the final notice contains a psych pps market basket update of 2.6% which is reduced by 0.5% to reflect a productivity adjustment, and reduced by 0.1% to reflect an "other adjustment" required by the social security act.
in july, 2015, cms published it psych pps final rule for the federal fiscal year 2016. under this final rule, payments to psychiatric hospitals and units are estimated to increase by 1.7% compared to federal fiscal year 2015. this amount includes the effect of the 2.4% market basket update less a 0.2% adjustment as required by the affordable care act and a 0.5% productivity adjustment. the final rule also updates the inpatient psychiatric quality reporting program, which requires psychiatric facilities to report on quality measures or incur a reduction in their annual payment update.
on july 31, 2014, cms published it psych pps final rule for the federal fiscal year 2015. under this final rule, payments to psychiatric hospitals and units are estimated to increase by 2.1% compared to federal fiscal year 2014. this amount includes the effect of the 2.9% market basket update adjusted by the affordable care act required 0.3% reduction and the -0.5% productivity adjustment. the final rule also updates the inpatient psychiatric quality reporting program, which requires psychiatric facilities to report on quality measures or incur a reduction in their annual payment update.
in october, 2015, cms published its opps final rule for 2016. the hospital market basket increase is 2.4%. the medicare statute requires a productivity adjustment reduction of 0.5% and 0.2% reduction to the 2016 opps market basket. additionally, cms also proposes a reduction of 2.0%, which the cms claims is necessary to eliminate $1 billion in excess laboratory payments that cms packaged into opps payment rates in 2014 resulting in a 2016 opps market basket update at -0.3%. when other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, we estimate that our overall medicare opps update for 2016 will aggregate to a net decrease of -0.2% which includes a 7.0% increase to behavioral health division partial hospitalization rates. when the behavioral health division's partial hospitalization rate impact is excluded, we estimate that our medicare 2016 opps payments will result in -1.6% decrease in payment levels for our acute care division, as compared to 2015.
in october, 2014, cms published its opps final rule for 2015. the hospital market basket increase is 2.9%. the medicare statute requires a productivity adjustment reduction of 0.5% and 0.2% reduction to the 2015 opps market basket resulting in a 2015 opps market basket update at 2.2%. in the final rule, cms will reduce the 2015 medicare rates for both hospital-based and community mental health center partial hospitalization programs. when other statutorily required adjustments, hospital patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered, we estimate that our overall medicare opps for 2015 will aggregate to a net increase of 0.2%. excluding the behavioral health division partial hospitalization rate impact, our medicare opps payment increase for 2015 is estimated to be 1.5%.

medicaid: medicaid is a joint federal-state funded health care benefit program that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care. most state medicaid payments are made under a pps-like system, or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals. amounts received under the medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospital's customary charges for services provided. in addition to revenues received pursuant to the medicare program, we receive a large portion of our revenues either directly from medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing medicaid. all of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.
we receive medicaid revenues in excess of $90 million annually from each of texas, washington, d.c., california, nevada, illinois, pennsylvania, virginia, massachusetts and florida, making us particularly sensitive to reductions in medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states.
the affordable care act substantially increases the federally and state-funded medicaid insurance program, and authorizes states to establish federally subsidized non-medicaid health plans for low-income residents not eligible for medicaid starting in 2014. however, the supreme court has struck down portions of the affordable care act requiring states to expand their medicaid programs in exchange for increased federal funding. accordingly, there can be no assurance that states in which we operate will expand medicaid coverage to individuals at 133% of the federal poverty level. facilities in states not opting to expand medicaid coverage under the affordable care act may be additionally penalized by corresponding reductions to medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments, as discussed below. we can provide no assurance that further reductions to medicaid revenues, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
texas and south carolina medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments:
hospitals that have an unusually large number of low-income patients (i.e., those with a medicaid utilization rate of at least one standard deviation above the mean medicaid utilization, or having a low income patient utilization rate exceeding 25%) are eligible to receive a dsh adjustment. congress established a national limit on dsh adjustments. although this legislation and the resulting state broad-based provider taxes have affected the payments we receive under the medicaid program, to date the net impact has not been materially adverse.
upon meeting certain conditions and serving a disproportionately high share of texas' and south carolina's low income patients, five of our facilities located in texas and one facility located in south carolina received additional reimbursement from each state's dsh fund. the south carolina and texas dsh programs were renewed for each state's 2016 dsh fiscal year (covering the period of october 1, 2015 through september 30, 2016). during the second quarter of 2015, the texas health and human services commission ("thhsc") finalized dsh payments for federal fiscal year 2014 which resulted in a $6 million annualized reduction in our texas medicaid dsh payments retroactive to october, 2013. in connection with these dsh programs, included in our financial results was an aggregate of $36 million during 2015, $49 million during 2014 and $54 million during 2013. we expect reimbursements to our hospitals, pursuant to the 2016 fiscal year programs for texas and south carolina, to be at amounts similar to each state's 2015 fiscal year amounts.
the affordable care act and subsequent federal legislation provides for a significant reduction in medicaid disproportionate share payments beginning in federal fiscal year 2018 (see below in sources of revenues and health care reform-medicaid revisions for additional disclosure). the u.s. department of health and human services is to determine the amount of medicaid dsh payment cuts imposed on each state based on a defined methodology. as medicaid dsh payments to states will be cut, consequently, payments to medicaid-participating providers, including our hospitals in texas and south carolina, will likely be reduced in the coming years. we are unable to estimate the impact of this federally required reduction at this time.
various state medicaid supplemental payment programs:
we incur health-care related taxes ("provider taxes") imposed by states in the form of a licensing fee, assessment or other mandatory payment which are related to: (i) healthcare items or services; (ii) the provision of, or the authority to provide, the health care items or services, or; (iii) the payment for the health care items or services. such provider taxes are subject to various federal regulations that limit the scope and amount of the taxes that can be levied by states in order to secure federal matching funds as part of their respective state medicaid programs. we derive a related medicaid reimbursement benefit from assessed provider taxes in the form of medicaid claims based payment increases and/or lump sum medicaid supplemental payments.
under these programs, including the impact of uncompensated care and upper payment limit programs, and the texas delivery system reform incentive program, we earned revenues (before provider taxes) of approximately $307 million during 2015, $295 million during 2014 and $213 million during 2013. these revenues were offset by provider taxes of $137 million during 2015, $140 million during 2014 and $84 million during 2013, which are recorded in other operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income as included herein.
57
texas uncompensated care/upper payment limit payments:
certain of our acute care hospitals located in various counties of texas (hidalgo, maverick, potter and webb) participate in medicaid supplemental payment section 1115 waiver indigent care programs. section 1115 waiver uncompensated care ("uc") payments replace the former upper payment limit ("upl") payments. these hospitals also have affiliation agreements with third-party hospitals to provide free hospital and physician care to qualifying indigent residents of these counties. our hospitals receive both supplemental payments from the medicaid program and indigent care payments from third-party, affiliated hospitals. the supplemental payments are contingent on the county or hospital district making an inter-governmental transfer ("igt") to the state medicaid program while the indigent care payment is contingent on a transfer of funds from the applicable affiliated hospitals. however, the county or hospital district is prohibited from entering into an agreement to condition any igt on the amount of any private hospital's indigent care obligation. during the second quarter of 2015, thhsc finalized the uc for federal fiscal year 2014 which resulted in an annualized $3 million increase in uc payments retroactive to october 1, 2013. we recorded net revenues/benefit from uc and affiliated hospital indigent care revenues of $61 million (net of provider taxes of $8 million) during 2015, $68 million (net of provider taxes of $17 million) during 2014 and $61 million (net of provider taxes of $10 million) during 2013. in april, 2015, thhsc published a final rule that would shift $136 million in funding from the private hospital uc pool to the large public hospital uc pool for the 2014 uc program year only. the impact from this final rule is incorporated into 2014 and 2015 uc amounts, as mentioned above. if the applicable hospital district or county makes igts consistent with 2015 levels, we believe we would be entitled to aggregate net revenues/benefit earned pursuant to these programs of approximately $55 million (net of provider taxes of $10 million) during 2016.
on september 30, 2014, cms notified the texas health and human services commission that it was deferring the federal matching funds (approximately $75 million) on texas medicaid uc payments made to providers in certain counties. a deferral results in cms withholding funds from the state representing the federal portion of medicaid payments the state has previously made to providers. a deferral goes into effect when cms questions the basis for all or part of the amount of medicaid payments made to certain providers, and remains in place subject to cms's final determination. our texas hospitals are not located in the geographic areas impacted by this deferral. on january 7, 2015, cms removed the aforementioned deferral but indicated they will continue their review and assessment of the underlying uc financing arrangements as to ensure their compliance with the applicable federal regulations and eligibility for federal matching dollars. in may, 2015, thhsc was informed by cms that current private-hospital funding arrangements can continue for waiver-payment dates through august, 2017, without risk of disallowance of federal matching funds on the same grounds questioned in last year's deferral.
for state fiscal year 2016, texas medicaid will continue to operate under a cms-approved section 1115 five-year medicaid waiver demonstration program. during the first five years of this program that started in state fiscal year 2012, the thhsc transitioned away from upl payments to new waiver incentive payment programs, uc payments and delivery system reform incentive payments ("dsrip"). during the first year of transition, which commenced on october 1, 2011, thhsc made payments to medicaid upl recipient providers that received payments during the state's prior fiscal year. during demonstration years two through five (october 1, 2012 through september 30, 2016), thhsc has, and will continue to, make incentive payments under the program after certain qualifying criteria are met by hospitals. supplemental payments are also subject to aggregate statewide caps based on cms approved medicaid waiver amounts.
texas delivery system reform incentive payments:
in addition, the texas medicaid section 1115 waiver includes a dsrip pool to incentivize hospitals and other providers to transform their service delivery practices to improve quality, health status, patient experience, coordination, and cost-effectiveness. dsrip pool payments are incentive payments to hospitals and other providers that develop programs or strategies to enhance access to health care, increase the quality of care, the cost-effectiveness of care provided and the health of the patients and families served. in may, 2014, cms formally approved specific dsrip projects for certain of our hospitals for demonstration years 3 to 5 (our facilities did not materially participate in the dsrip pool during demonstration years 1 or 2). dsrip payments are contingent on the hospital meeting certain pre-determined milestones, metrics and clinical outcomes. additionally, dsrip payments are contingent on a governmental entity providing an igt for the non-federal share component of the dsrip payment. thhsc generally approves dsrip reported metrics, milestones and clinical outcomes on a semi-annual basis in june and december. we recorded net dsrip revenues/benefit of approximately $24 million (net of provider taxes of $15 million) during 2015 and $17 million (net of provider taxes of $8 million) during 2014. there were no dsrip revenues/benefit recorded during 2013. although we can provide no assurance that we will ultimately qualify for additional dsrip revenues, subject to cms's approval and other conditions as outlined above, we estimate that we may be entitled to additional dsrip revenues/benefit of approximately $25 million (net of provider taxes of $16 million) during 2016.
nevada spa:
in nevada, cms approved a state plan amendment ("spa") in august, 2014 that implemented a hospital supplemental payment program retroactive to january 1, 2014 and effective to june 30, 2015. in september, 2015, cms also approved the successor
58
supplemental payment program retroactive to july 1, 2015 to june 30, 2016.  included in our results of operations during 2015 and 2014 were approximately $10 million and $12 million, respectively, of net revenues earned in connection with this program.  we estimate that our reimbursements pursuant to these programs will approximate $10 million during 2016.
various other state medicaid supplemental payment programs:
including the impact of the programs in various states applicable to each year, and excluding the impact of various programs in texas and the nevada spa, as discussed above, we earned an aggregate net revenues/benefit from medicaid supplemental payments of approximately $86 million (net of provider taxes of $113 million) during 2015, $71 million (net of provider taxes of $115 million) during 2014 and $69 million (net of provider taxes of $74 million) during 2013.  we estimate that our aggregate net revenues/benefit from provider tax programs will approximate $80 million (net of provider taxes of $126 million) during 2016. these amounts include the impact of the cms approved california provider tax and related medicaid supplemental payment programs, which did not have a material impact on our operating results. the aggregate net benefit is earned from multiple states and therefore no particular state's portion is individually material to our consolidated financial statements. however, provider taxes are governed by both federal and state laws and are subject to future legislative changes that, if reduced from current rates in several states, could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated future results of operations.
as outlined above, we receive substantial reimbursement from multiple states in connection with various supplemental medicaid payment programs. failure to renew these programs beyond their scheduled termination dates, failure of the public hospitals to provide the necessary igts for the states' share of the dsh programs, failure of our hospitals that currently receive supplemental medicaid revenues to qualify for future funds under these programs, or reductions in reimbursements, could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
hitech act: in july 2010, the department of health and human services ("hhs") published final regulations implementing the health information technology ("hit") provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act (referred to as the "hitech act"). the final regulation defines the "meaningful use" of electronic health records ("ehr") and establishes the requirements for the medicare and medicaid ehr payment incentive programs. the final rule established an initial set of standards and certification criteria. the implementation period for these new medicare and medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for medicare and 2021 for the state medicaid programs. state medicaid program participation in this federally funded incentive program is voluntary but all of the states in which our eligible hospitals operate have chosen to participate. our acute care hospitals may qualify for these ehr incentive payments upon implementation of the ehr application assuming they meet the "meaningful use" criteria. the government's ultimate goal is to promote more effective (quality) and efficient healthcare delivery through the use of technology to reduce the total cost of healthcare for all americans and utilizing the cost savings to expand access to the healthcare system.
pursuant to hitech act regulations, hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of ehr by 2015 were subject to a reduced market basket update to the ipps standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year. all of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria and therefore were not subject to a reduced market basked update to the ipps standardized amount in federal fiscal year 2015. however, under the hitech act, hospitals must continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year.  no reduction is expected for federal fiscal year 2016. failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations.
our 2015 consolidated results of operations includes an unfavorable pre-tax impact of approximately $18 million consisting of approximately $16 million of ehr incentive income less approximately $37 million of depreciation and amortization expense, plus approximately $3 million of net expense attributable to noncontrolling interests.  our 2014 consolidated results of operations includes an unfavorable pre-tax impact of approximately $8 million consisting of approximately $28 million of ehr incentive income less approximately $37 million of depreciation and amortization expense, plus approximately $1 million of net expense attributable to noncontrolling interests. our 2013 consolidated results of operations includes a favorable pre-tax impact of approximately $19 million consisting of approximately $61 million of ehr incentive income less approximately $10 million of salaries, wages, benefits and other operating expenses, approximately $33 million of depreciation and amortization expense, plus approximately $1 million of net expense attributable to noncontrolling interests.
federal regulations require that medicare ehr incentive payments be computed based on the medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable "meaningful use" requirements. since the annual medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on december 31st , we will recognize medicare ehr incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the "meaningful use" criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year.
managed care: a significant portion of our net patient revenues are generated from managed care companies, which include health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and managed medicare (referred to as medicare part c or
59
medicare advantage) and medicaid programs. in general, we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow. the consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate. typically, we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers, however, during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payors including managed care companies.
commercial insurance: our hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance. private insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or, in some cases, reimburse their policy holders, based upon the particular hospital's established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy. private insurance reimbursement varies among payors and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payor.
commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms, including predetermined payment or drg-based payment systems, for more inpatient and outpatient services. to the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers' reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries, such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals.
other sources: our hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage. such patients are evaluated, at the time of service or shortly thereafter, for their ability to pay based upon federal and state poverty guidelines, qualifications for medicaid or other state assistance programs, as well as our local hospitals' indigent and charity care policy. patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for medicaid or indigent care write-offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances.
sources of revenues and health care reform: given increasing budget deficits, the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of medicare and medicaid funding, which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals. in addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of, among other things, economic recovery stimulus packages, responses to natural disasters, and the federal budget deficit in general may affect the availability of federal funds to provide additional relief in the future. we are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations.
in march, 2010, the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 (h.r. 4872, p.l. 111-152), (the "reconciliation act") and the patient protection and affordable care act (p.l. 111-148), (the "affordable care act"), were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for u.s. citizens as well as material revisions to the federal medicare and state medicaid programs. medicare, medicaid and other health care industry changes which are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade are noted below.
implemented medicare reductions and reforms:
·   the reconciliation act reduced the market basket update for inpatient and outpatient hospitals and inpatient behavioral health facilities by 0.25% in each of 2010 and 2011, by 0.10% in each of 2012 and 2013 and 0.30% in 2014.

·   the affordable care act implemented certain reforms to medicare advantage payments, effective in 2011.

·   a medicare shared savings program, effective in 2012.

·   a hospital readmissions reduction program, effective in 2012.

·   a value-based purchasing program for hospitals, effective in 2012.

·   a national pilot program on payment bundling, effective in 2013.

·   reduction to medicare disproportionate share hospital ("dsh") payments, effective in 2014, as discussed above.

medicaid revisions:
·   expanded medicaid eligibility and related special federal payments, effective in 2014.

·   the affordable care act (as amended by subsequent federal legislation) requires annual aggregate reductions in federal dsh funding from federal fiscal year ("ffy") 2018 through ffy 2025. the aggregate annual reduction amounts are:

$2.0 billion for ffy 2018
$3.0 billion for ffy 2019
$4.0 billion for ffy 2020
60
$5.0 billion for ffy 2021
$6.0 billion for ffy 2022
$7.0 billion for ffy 2023
$8.0 billion for ffy 2024
$8.0 billion for ffy 2025
health insurance revisions:
·   large employer insurance reforms, effective in 2015.

·   individual insurance mandate and related federal subsidies, effective in 2014.

·   federally mandated insurance coverage reforms, effective in 2010 and forward.

the affordable care act seeks to increase competition among private health insurers by providing for transparent federal and state insurance exchanges. the affordable care act also prohibits private insurers from adjusting insurance premiums based on health status, gender, or other specified factors. we cannot provide assurance that these provisions will not adversely affect the ability of private insurers to pay for services provided to insured patients, or that these changes will not have a negative material impact on our results of operations going forward.
value-based purchasing:
there is a trend in the healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services. these value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities. governmental programs including medicare and medicaid currently require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates. in addition, medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events. many large commercial payers currently require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payers do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events.
the affordable care act contains a number of provisions intended to promote value-based purchasing. the affordable care act prohibits the use of federal funds under the medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat hospital acquired conditions ("hac"). beginning in ffy 2015, hospitals that fall into the top 25% of national risk-adjusted hac rates for all hospitals in the previous year will receive a 1% reduction in their total medicare payments. additionally, hospitals with excessive readmissions for conditions designated by hhs will receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excessive readmission standard.
the affordable care act also required hhs to implement a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services which became effective on october 1, 2012. the affordable care act requires hhs to reduce inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by a percentage beginning at 1% in ffy 2013 and increasing by 0.25% each fiscal year up to 2% in ffy 2017 and subsequent years. hhs will pool the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards established by hhs. hhs will determine the amount each hospital that meets or exceeds the quality performance standards will receive from the pool of dollars created by these payment reductions. in its fiscal year 2016 ipps final rule, cms will fund the value-based purchasing program by reducing base operating drg payment amounts to participating hospitals by 1.75%.
readmission reduction program:
in the affordable care act, congress also mandated implementation of the hospital readmission reduction program ("hrrp"). the hrrp assesses penalties on hospitals having excess readmission rates when compared to expected rates, effective for discharges beginning october 1, 2012. in the fiscal year 2013 ipps final rule, cms finalized certain policies with regard to payment under the hrrp, including which hospitals are subject to the hrrp, the methodology to calculate the hospital readmission payment adjustment factor, and what portion of the ipps payment is used to calculate the readmission adjustment factor. in the fiscal year 2014 ipps final rule, cms finalized revisions to the three 30-day admission measures in the program-heart failure, myocardial infarction, and pneumonia-to exclude planned readmissions. under the affordable care act, beginning in fiscal year 2015, the maximum reduction in payments under the hrrp will increase from 2% to 3%. cms will expand the program and add two readmission measures, one, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) and, two, patients admitted for elective total hip
61
arthroplasty (tha) and total knee arthroplasty (tka). in the fiscal year 2015 ipps final rule, cms added readmissions for coronary artery bypass graft (cabg) surgical procedures beginning in fiscal year 2017. the impact of hrrp for federal fiscal year 2015 did not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
accountable care organizations:
the affordable care act requires hhs to establish a medicare shared savings program that promotes accountability and coordination of care through the creation of accountable care organizations ("acos"). the aco program allows providers (including hospitals), physicians and other designated professionals and suppliers to voluntarily work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. the program is intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency. acos that achieve quality performance standards established by hhs will be eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the medicare program.
in addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the medicare and each of the state medicaid programs, our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings, new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations, post-payment audits, requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities. the final determination of amounts we receive under the medicare and medicaid programs often takes many years, because of audits by the program representatives, providers' rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions. we believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments. nevertheless, until final adjustments are made, certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required.
finally, we expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls. reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.
other operating results combined net revenues and income/losses before income taxes from our surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during 2015, 2014 or 2013.

(a.)   in august, 2014, we entered into a fourth amendment to our credit agreement dated november 15, 2010, as amended. the credit agreement, as amended, which is scheduled to expire in august, 2019, consists of: (i) an $800 million revolving credit facility, and; (ii) a $1.775 billion term loan a facility, which combined our previously outstanding term loan a and term loan a2 facilities (which were scheduled to mature in 2016). interest rates were not impacted by the fourth amendment to the credit agreement. the term loan b-1 facility was repaid in august, 2014, utilizing other borrowed funds.

(b.)   in july, 2014, we redeemed the entire $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 7% senior notes due in 2018. an $11 million make-whole premium was paid in connection with this early extinguishment.

(c.)   in august, 2014, we completed an offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.750% senior secured notes due in 2019 and $300 million aggregate principal amount of 4.750% senior secured notes due in 2022.

(d.)   in december, 2015, we amended our existing accounts receivable securitization program, which was scheduled to expire in october, 2016, to extend the term through december 21, 2018 and increase the borrowing limit to $400 million from $360 million.

(e.)   in may, 2013 we completed a third amendment to our credit agreement dated november 15, 2010, as amended. the third amendment provided for a reduction in the interest rates payable in connection with certain borrowings outstanding at that time under the credit agreement. specifically, we replaced our then outstanding $745.9 million senior secured term loan b with a new senior secured term loan b1 in the same amount on substantially the same terms as the term loan b, other than lower interest rates.

interest expense decreased $20 million during 2015 to $113 million as compared to $134 million during 2014. the decrease was due primarily to: (i) a $3 million decrease in aggregate interest expense on our revolving credit, demand notes, senior notes, term loan facilities and accounts receivable securitization program due primarily to a decrease in our average outstanding borrowings as well as a decrease in our aggregate average cost of borrowings pursuant to these facilities, as discussed below;  (ii) a $9 million decrease  in interest rate swap expense, resulting primarily from the 2015 maturities of our previously outstanding interest rate swaps, and;  (iii) an $8 million decrease in amortization and financing fees, resulting primarily from the write-off of certain deferred financing costs and original issue discounts in connection with various financing transactions that occurred during the third quarter of 2014, as discussed above.
interest expense decreased $12 million during 2014 to $134 million as compared to $146 million during 2013. the decrease was due primarily to: (i) a $16 million decrease in aggregate interest expense on our revolving credit, demand notes, senior notes, term loan facilities and accounts receivable securitization program due primarily to a decrease in our average outstanding borrowings as well as a decrease in our aggregate average cost of borrowings pursuant to these facilities, as discussed below; (ii) a $6 million decrease in the amortization of financing fees, resulting primarily from the write-off of certain deferred financing costs and original issue discounts in connections with the financing transactions during the third quarter of 2014, as discussed above, offset by; (iii) $5 million of capitalized interest recorded on major projects during 2013, and; (iv) a $5 million decrease in interest income, primarily related to the interest income received from illinois during 2013 related to delayed cash remittances to us.
the aggregate average outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit, demand notes, senior notes, term loan facilities and accounts receivable securitization program were approximately $3.1 billion during 2015, $3.2 billion during 2014 and $3.5 billion during 2013. the average effective interest rate on these facilities, excluding the amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense was 2.9% during each of 2015 and 2014 and 3.1% during 2013. the average effective interest rate on these facilities, including amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense was 3.4% during 2015, 3.9% during 2014 and 4.2% during 2013.
costs related to early extinguishment of debt in connection with various financing transactions completed during 2014, as discussed below in capital resources-credit facilities and outstanding debt securities, our 2014 results of operations include a $36 million pre-tax charge incurred for the costs related to the extinguishment of debt. this charge consisted of the write-off of deferred charges ($20 million) and original issue discount on the extinguished debt ($5 million) as well as the make-whole premium paid ($11 million) on the early redemption of the $250 million, 7.00% senior unsecured notes. there were no costs related to early extinguishment of debt incurred during 2015 or 2013.

provision for income taxes and effective tax rates the effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before income taxes, were as follows for each of the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollar amounts in thousands):

outside owners hold various noncontrolling, minority ownership interests in seven of our acute care facilities and one behavioral health care facility. each of these facilities are owned and operated by limited liability companies ("llc") or limited partnerships ("lp"). as a result, since there is no income tax liability incurred at the llc/lp level (since it passes through to the members/partners), the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests does not include any income tax provision/benefit. when computing the provision for income taxes, as reflected on our consolidated statements of income, the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is deducted from income before income taxes since it represents the third-party members'/partners' share of the income generated by the joint-venture entities. in addition to providing the effective tax rates, as indicated above (as calculated from dividing the provision for income taxes by the income before income taxes as reflected on the consolidated statements of income), we believe it is helpful to our investors that we also provide our effective tax rate as calculated after giving effect to the portion of our pre-tax income that is attributable to the third-party members/partners.
the effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by the difference in income before income taxes, minus net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, were as follows for each of the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollar amounts in thousands):

the impact of the discrete tax items did not have a material impact on our provision for income taxes during 2015, 2014 or 2013. the decrease in the effective tax rate during 2015, as compared to 2014, was due primarily to lower effective income tax rates applicable to the income generated during 2015 at the behavioral health care facilities located in the u.k. that were acquired since the third quarter of 2014. the decrease in the effective tax rate during 2014, as compared to 2013, was due primarily to: (i) a decrease in our blended effective state income tax rate during 2014; (ii) the income tax provision recorded during 2013 on the sale of peak behavioral health services which was divested in may, 2013 (the tax basis gain realized on the sale of peak behavioral health services exceeded the gain recorded pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles), and; (iii) a decrease to our federal income tax provision relating to 2013 that was recorded during 2014.
we consider the undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no u.s. income taxes have been provided thereon. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $49 million and $12 million, respectively.
discontinued operations there were no material divestitures during 2015 or 2014.
in connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the federal trade commission ("ftc") in connection with our acquisition of ascend health corporation in october of 2012, we agreed to certain conditions, including the divestiture of peak behavioral health services ("peak"), a 104-bed behavioral health care facility located in santa teresa, new mexico. the divestiture of peak was completed during the second quarter of 2013 for total cash proceeds of approximately $24 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $3 million which is included in our 2013 consolidated financial statements.
64
the following table shows the results of operations for peak, which was reflected as discontinued operations during our period of ownership during 2013 (amounts in thousands). since the aggregate income from discontinued operations before income tax expense is not material to our consolidated financial statements, it is included as a reduction to other operating expenses.

effects of inflation and seasonality seasonality -our acute care services business is typically seasonal, with higher patient volumes and net patient service revenue in the first and fourth quarters of the year. this seasonality occurs because, generally, more people become ill during the winter months, which results in significant increases in the number of patients treated in our hospitals during those months.
inflation -inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years. however, since the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures, as are supply and other costs, we cannot predict the impact that future economic conditions may have on our ability to contain future expense increases. our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to medicare and medicaid patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws which have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices. we believe, however, that through adherence to cost containment policies, labor management and reasonable price increases, the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable.
liquidity year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to december 31, 2014:
net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $1.021 billion during 2015 as compared to $1.036 billion during 2014. the net decrease of $15 million was primarily attributable to the following:
·   a favorable change of $162 million due to an increase in net income plus/minus depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, net gains on sales of assets and businesses, and costs related to extinguishment of debt;

·   a $199 million unfavorable change in other working capital accounts due primarily to unfavorable changes in accrued compensation and accounts payable resulting from the timing of disbursements;

·   a $68 million unfavorable change in accrued and deferred income taxes;

·   a $60 million favorable change in accounts receivable;

·   a favorable change of $22 million in accrued insurance expense, net of commercial premiums paid, due primarily to a $20 million reduction recorded during 2014 to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves, based upon a reserve analysis, and;

·   increased the borrowing capacity on our existing accounts receivable securitization program ("securitization") to $360 million from $275 million, effective august 1, 2014. in december, 2015, the securitization was amended to increase the borrowing capacity to $400 million and extend the scheduled maturity date to december 21, 2018;

borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at either (1) the abr rate which is defined as the rate per annum equal to, at our election: the greatest of (a) the lender's prime rate, (b) the weighted average of the federal funds rate, plus 0.5% and (c) one month libor rate plus 1%, in each case, plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 0.50% to 1.25% for revolving credit and term loan-a borrowings, or (2) the one, two, three or six month libor rate (at our election), plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 1.50% to 2.25% for revolving credit and term loan-a borrowings. as of december 31, 2015, the applicable margins were 0.50% for abr-based loans and 1.50% for libor-based loans under the revolving credit and term loan-a facilities.
as of december 31, 2015, we had $300 million of borrowings outstanding pursuant to the terms of our $800 million revolving credit facility and we had $461 million of available borrowing capacity, net of $5 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to a short-term, on-demand credit facility and $34 million of outstanding letters of credit. the revolving credit facility includes a $125 million sub-limit for letters of credit. the credit agreement is secured by certain assets of the company (which generally excludes asset classes such as substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals, certain real estate assets and assets held in joint-ventures with third-parties) and our material subsidiaries and guaranteed by our material subsidiaries.
pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement, term loan-a quarterly installment payments of approximately: (i) $11 million commenced during the fourth quarter of 2014 and are scheduled to continue through september, 2016, and; (ii) $22 million are scheduled from the fourth quarter of 2016 through june, 2019.
as discussed above, in december, 2015, our securitization with a group of conduit lenders and liquidity banks was amended to increase the borrowing capacity to $400 million from $360 million and extend the scheduled maturity date to december 21, 2018. substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals ("receivables") serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings. we have accounted for this securitization as borrowings. we maintain effective control over the receivables since, pursuant to the terms of the securitization, the receivables are sold from certain of our subsidiaries to special purpose entities that are wholly-owned by us. the receivables, however, are owned by the special purpose entities, can be used only to satisfy the debts of the wholly-owned special purpose entities, and thus are not available to us except through our ownership interest in the special purpose entities. the wholly-owned special purpose entities use the receivables to collateralize the loans obtained from the group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks. the group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks do not have recourse to us beyond the assets of the wholly-owned special purpose entities that securitize the loans. at december 31, 2015, we had $400 million of outstanding borrowings and no additional capacity pursuant to the terms of our accounts receivable securitization program.
on august 7, 2014, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.750% senior secured notes due 2019 (the "2019 notes") and $300 million aggregate principal amount of 4.750% senior secured notes due 2022 (the "2022 notes", and together with the 2019 notes, the "new senior secured notes"). the new senior secured notes were offered only to qualified institutional buyers under rule 144a and to non-u.s. persons outside the united states in reliance on regulation s under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"). the new senior secured notes have not been registered under the securities act and may not be offered or sold in the united states absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. interest is payable on the new senior secured notes on february 1 and august 1 of each year to the holders of record at the close of business on the january 15 and july 15 immediately preceding the related interest payment dates, commencing on february 1, 2015 until the maturity date of august 1, 2019 for the 2019 notes and august 1, 2022 for the 2022 notes.
on june 30, 2006, we issued $250 million of senior secured notes which have a 7.125% coupon rate and mature on june 30, 2016 (the "7.125% notes"). interest on the 7.125% notes is payable semiannually in arrears on june 30th and december 30th of each year. in june, 2008, we issued an additional $150 million of 7.125% notes which formed a single series with the original 7.125% notes issued in june, 2006. other than their date of issuance and initial price to the public, the terms of the 7.125% notes issued in june, 2008 are identical to and trade interchangeably with, the 7.125% notes which were originally issued in june, 2006.  since we have the ability and intent to refinance the 7.125% notes on or before the scheduled maturity date (june 30, 2016) either through the issuance of new long-term notes, a new long-term debt facility, or utilizing funds borrowed pursuant to our revolving credit facility, the 7.125% notes are classified as long-term on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2015.
on july 31, 2014, we redeemed the $250 million, 7.00% senior unsecured notes (the "unsecured notes"), which were scheduled to mature on october 1, 2018, at a redemption price equal to 104.56% of the principal amount of the unsecured notes resulting in a make-whole premium payment of approximately $11 million. the unsecured notes were issued on september 29, 2010 and registered in april, 2011. interest on the unsecured note was payable semiannually in arrears on april 1st and october 1st of each year.
in connection with entering into the previous credit agreement on november 15, 2010, and in accordance with the indenture dated january 20, 2000 governing the rights of our existing notes, we entered into a supplemental indenture pursuant to which our
70
7.125% notes (due in 2016) were equally and ratably secured with the lenders under the credit agreement with respect to the collateral for so long as the lenders under the credit agreement are so secured.
the average amounts outstanding during each of years 2015, 2014 and 2013 under the current and prior credit agreements, demand notes and accounts receivable securitization programs was $2.1 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, with corresponding interest rates of 1.7%, 1.8% and 2.2%, respectively, including commitment and facility fees. the maximum amounts outstanding at any month-end were $2.3 billion in 2015, $2.7 billion in 2014 and $3.0 billion in 2013. the effective interest rate on our current and prior credit agreements, accounts receivable securitization programs, and demand notes, which includes the respective interest expense, commitment and facility fees, designated interest rate swaps expense and amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts, was 2.4% in 2015, 3.1% in 2014 and 3.6% in 2013.
our credit agreement includes a material adverse change clause that must be represented at each draw. the credit agreement contains covenants that include a limitation on sales of assets, mergers, change of ownership, liens and indebtedness, transactions with affiliates, dividends and stock repurchases; and requires compliance with financial covenants including maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage ratios. we are in compliance with all required covenants as of december 31, 2015.
at december 31, 2015, the carrying value and fair value of our debt were each approximately $3.5 billion. at december 31, 2014, the carrying value and fair value of our debt were each approximately $3.3 billion. the fair value of our debt was computed based upon quotes received from financial institutions. we consider these to be "level 2" in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with debt instruments.
our total debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 45% at december 31, 2015 and 47% at december 31, 2014.
we expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions, pay dividends and potentially repurchase shares of our common stock utilizing internally generated and additional funds. additional funds may be obtained through: (i) the issuance of equity; (ii) borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility or through refinancing the existing revolving credit agreement, and/or; (iii) the issuance of other long-term debt. we believe that our operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, available borrowing capacity under our $800 million revolving credit facility and $400 million accounts receivable securitization program, as well as access to the capital markets, provide us with sufficient capital resources to fund our operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months. however, in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time. our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2015 we were party to certain off balance sheet arrangements consisting of standby letters of credit and surety bonds which totaled $120 million consisting of: (i) $96 million related to our self-insurance programs, and; (ii) $24 million of other debt and public utility guarantees.
obligations under operating leases for real property, real property master leases and equipment amount to $331 million as of december 31, 2015. the real property master leases are leases for buildings on or near hospital property for which we guarantee a certain level of rental income. we sublease space in these buildings and any amounts received from these subleases are offset against the expense. in addition, we lease three hospital facilities from the trust with terms expiring in 2016. these leases contain up to three 5-year renewal options. we also lease the real property of certain facilities as indicated in item 2. properties, as included herein.

(c)   estimated construction cost of a newly constructed acute care hospital located in henderson, nevada, (henderson hospital) that is scheduled to be completed and opened during the fourth quarter of 2016. we are required to build this hospital pursuant to an agreement with a third party. in addition, we had various other projects under construction as of december 31, 2015. because we can terminate substantially all of the construction contracts related to the various other projects at any time without paying a termination fee, these costs are excluded from the above table except for the amount contractually committed to a third-party for henderson hospital. the aggregate estimated 2016 expenditures related to henderson hospital and the various other projects under construction as of december 31, 2015 is approximately $165 million.

(d)   consists of: (i) $70 million related to long-term contracts with third-parties consisting primarily of certain revenue cycle data processing services for our acute care facilities; (ii) $99 million related to the future expected costs to be paid to a third-party vendor in connection with the on-going operation of an electronic health records application for each of our acute care facilities, and; (iii) a $1 million liability for physician commitments expected to be paid in the future.

(g)   consists of accrued and unpaid estimated claims expense incurred in connection with our commercial health insurers and self-insured employee benefit plans.

as of december 31, 2015, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $204 million, of which $48 million is included in other current liabilities and $156 million is included in other non-current liabilities. we exclude the $204 million for professional and general liability claims from the contractual obligations table because there are no significant contractual obligations associated with these liabilities and because of the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments. please see self-insured/other insurance risks above for additional disclosure related to our professional and general liability claims and reserves.
in connection with five acute care facilities (and one additional facility currently under construction) located in las vegas, nevada, the minority ownership interests of which are reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our consolidated balance sheet, the outside owners have certain "put rights" that, if exercisable, and if exercised, require us to purchase the minority member's interests at fair market value. the put rights are exercisable upon the occurrence of: (i) certain specified financial conditions falling below established thresholds; (ii) breach of the management contract by the managing member (a subsidiary of ours), or; (iii) if the minority member's ownership percentage is reduced to less than certain thresholds. in connection with a behavioral health care facility located in philadelphia, pennsylvania and acquired by us as part of the psi acquisition, the minority ownership interest of which is
72
also reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our consolidated balance sheet, the outside owner has a "put option" to put its entire ownership interest to us at any time. if exercised, the put option requires us to purchase the minority member's interest at fair market value. we exclude the approximate amount that we may be required to pay to repurchase these minority ownership interests from the contractual obligations table because of the uncertainty as to: (i) whether or not the put rights, if exercisable, will actually be exercised; (ii) the dollar amounts that would be paid if the put rights were exercised, and; (iii) the timing of such payments.
additionally, the table above does not include $2 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as of december 31, 2015. due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows, we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for which the amounts may be utilized.

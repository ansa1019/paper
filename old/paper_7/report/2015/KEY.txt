throughout the notes to consolidated financial statements and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (the md&a), we use certain acronyms and abbreviations. these terms are defined in note 1 (summary of significant accounting policies), which begins on page 119.

introduction this section reviews the financial condition and results of operations of keycorp and its subsidiaries for each of the past three years. some tables include additional periods to comply with disclosure requirements or to illustrate trends in greater depth. when you read this discussion, you should also refer to the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this report. the page locations of specific sections that we refer to are presented in the table of contents.
terminology throughout this discussion, references to key, we, our, us, and similar terms refer to the consolidated entity consisting of keycorp and its subsidiaries. keycorp refers solely to the parent holding company, and keybank refers solely to keycorps subsidiary bank, keybank national association. keybank (consolidated) refers to the consolidated entity consisting of keybank and its subsidiaries.
we want to explain some industry-specific terms at the outset so you can better understand the discussion that follows.
¿     we use the phrase continuing operations in this document to mean all of our businesses other than the education lending business, victory, and austin. the education lending business and austin have been accounted for as discontinued operations since 2009. victory was classified as a discontinued operation in our first quarter 2013 financial reporting as a result of the sale of this business as announced on february 21, 2013, and closed on july 31, 2013.

¿   our exit loan portfolios are separate from our discontinued operations. these portfolios, which are in a run-off mode, stem from product lines we decided to cease because they no longer fit with our corporate strategy. these exit loan portfolios are included in other segments.

¿                       we engage in capital markets activities primarily through business conducted by our key corporate bank segment. these activities encompass a variety of products and services. among other things, we trade securities as a dealer, enter into derivative contracts (both to accommodate clients financing needs and to mitigate certain risks), and conduct transactions in foreign currencies (both to accommodate clients needs and to benefit from fluctuations in exchange rates).

¿                        for regulatory purposes, capital is divided into two classes. federal regulations currently prescribe that at least one-half of a bank or bhcs total risk-based capital must qualify as tier 1
capital. both total and tier 1 capital serve as bases for several measures of capital adequacy, which is an important indicator of financial stability and condition. as described under the heading regulatory capital and liquidity
 capital planning and stress testing in the section entitled supervision and regulation in item 1 of this report, the regulators are required to conduct a supervisory capital assessment of all bhcs with assets of at least $50 billion, including keycorp. as part of this capital adequacy review, banking regulators evaluated a component of tier 1 capital, known as tier 1 common equity, using the definitions of tier 1 capital and total risk-weighted assets that were in effect in 2014, as well as a transition plan for full implementation of the regulatory capital rules. the section entitled capital  capital adequacy in this md&amp;a provides more information on total capital, tier 1 capital, tier 1 common equity, and the regulatory capital rules, including common equity tier 1, and describes how the three measures are calculated.

additionally, a comprehensive list of the acronyms and abbreviations used throughout this discussion is included in note 1 (summary of significant accounting policies).

economic overview the economy continued its modest recovery in 2015, with overall gdp of 2.4% unchanged from the prior year. 2015 was a volatile year, with the first quarter starting at a slow pace, then growth picking up over the next six months before decelerating again in the fourth quarter. throughout 2015, slowing emerging market growth, a strengthening u.s. dollar, and falling demand for u.s. exports were all significant factors that held back growth. additionally, oil prices dropped 32% over the year, giving consumers a boost in discretionary income but resulting in a sharp decline in energy-related investments. the stock market disappointed in 2015, with the s&p 500 equity index dropping 1%, compared to an 11% increase in 2014, largely due to uncertainty around chinese equity markets and oil and commodity prices. globally, the economic recovery slowed; the european central bank maintained an easy money policy as their recovery stalled and the risk of deflation rose, while emerging markets struggled in the face of low commodity prices and a weakening chinese economy.
for 2015, 2.7 million new jobs were added in the u.s. the unemployment rate fell further, from 5.6% at december 31, 2014, to 5.0% at december 31, 2015. while weak labor force participation was a factor, solid employment gains also drove the decline. slack remains, however, reflected in underwhelming wage growth for much of the year. consumers preferred to solidify their balance sheets in 2015, as the savings rate rose to 5.5% in december 2015 while consumer spending, although still solid, declined to 2.6%. by december 2015, headline inflation remained at .7%, mainly due to a further decline in energy prices. core inflation also remained low throughout the year, ending 2015 at 2.1%, up from 1.6% at the end of 2014.
as the economy expanded further and the labor market continued to strengthen, the housing market gained traction, with slight improvement across nearly all metrics in 2015. while household formation is normalizing, a declining home ownership rate continues to weigh on sales growth. existing home sales finished 2015 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.46 million, up 7.7% from december 2014. new home sales ended the year on a solid note, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 544,000 in december 2015, up 9.9% from 2014. price appreciation picked up modestly, with the median price for existing homes up 6.3% year-over-year in december 2015, compared to 4.6% in 2014. housing starts accelerated further, up 6.4% from december 2014, driven by gains in both single and multi-family construction of 6.1% and 7.0%, respectively.
the federal reserve remained active and accommodative for most of 2015. the federal open market committee (fomc) decided to maintain the existing policy of reinvesting principal payments to help accommodate financial conditions throughout the year. in addition, the fomc kept the federal funds target rate near zero until december 2015, lifting the target rate by 25 basis points, citing an improving labor market and the expectation that inflation would return to its 2% objective over the medium term. the 10-year u.s. treasury yield began the year at 2.2%, and dipped to as low as 1.7% for the first quarter of 2015, driven by disappointing weather-related economic data. in the third quarter of 2015, with rising speculation around higher interest rates, the 10-year u.s. treasury yield began to increase, reaching 2.4%, and ended the year at 2.3%, as interest rates eased (even after the fomc raised rates) due to concerns of slower global growth, lower energy prices, and equity market volatility.

corporate strategy we remain committed to enhancing long-term shareholder value by continuing to execute our relationship business model, growing our franchise, and being disciplined in our management of capital. our 2015-2016 strategic focus is to grow by building enduring relationships through client-focused solutions and service. we intend to pursue this strategy by growing profitably; acquiring and expanding targeted client relationships; effectively managing risk and rewards; maintaining financial strength; and engaging, retaining, and inspiring our diverse and high-performing workforce. these strategic priorities for enhancing long-term shareholder value are described in more detail below.
¿                         grow profitably  we will continue to focus on generating positive operating leverage by growing revenue and creating a more efficient operating environment. we expect our relationship business model to keep generating organic growth as it helps us expand engagement with existing clients and attract new customers. we will leverage our continuous improvement culture to create a more efficient cost structure that is aligned, sustainable, and consistent with the current operating environment and supports our relationship business model.

38
¿   acquire and expand targeted client relationships  we have taken purposeful steps to enhance our ability to acquire and expand targeted relationships. our local delivery of a broad product set and industry expertise allows us to match client needs and market conditions to deliver the best solutions.

¿   effectively manage risk and rewards  our risk management activities are focused on ensuring we properly identify, measure, and manage risks across the entire company to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability.

¿   maintain financial strength  with the foundation of a strong balance sheet, we will remain focused on sustaining strong reserves, liquidity and capital. we will work closely with our board and regulators to manage capital to support our clients needs and drive long-term shareholder value. our capital remains a competitive advantage for us.

¿   engage a high-performing, talented, and diverse workforce  every day our employees provide our clients with great ideas, extraordinary service, and smart solutions. we will continue to engage our high-performing, talented, and diverse workforce to create an environment where they can make a difference, own their careers, be respected, and feel a sense of pride.

strategic developments we initiated the following actions during 2015 to support our corporate strategy:
¿                  we continue to focus on growing our businesses and remain committed to improving productivity and efficiency. during 2015, we generated positive operating leverage, with pre-provision net revenue up 4.7% from 2014. net interest income benefited from solid loan growth, driven by a 12% increase in average commercial, financial and agricultural loans. noninterest income benefited from increases in several of our core fee-based businesses: investment banking and debt placement fees, which had record high fees in 2015 due to stronger financial advisory fees and loan syndications, trust and investment services income, corporate services income, and cards and payments income. although noninterest expense increased from prior year, this increase was primarily due to the ongoing investments we have made in our businesses to drive revenue growth, including the addition of client-facing personnel across our franchise.

¿   our strong risk management practices and a more favorable credit environment resulted in another year of solid credit quality trends. for 2015, net loan charge-offs were .24% of average loans and the provision for credit losses was .28% of average loans, both well below our targeted range.

¿                    we also made progress on other strategic initiatives. on october 30, 2015, we announced that keycorp entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of first niagara. the merger is currently expected to be completed during the third quarter of 2016 and is subject to customary closing conditions including the approval of regulators and the shareholders of both keycorp and first niagara. this merger is expected to accelerate our transformation into a high-performing regional bank, generate attractive financial returns, provide significant revenue opportunities, and create a complementary business mix and a more balanced franchise.

¿                     capital management remained a priority in 2015. on march 11, 2015, the federal reserve announced that it did not object to our 2015 capital plan submitted as part of the annual ccar process. the 2015 capital plan included a common share repurchase program of up to $725 million, including repurchases to offset issuances of common shares under our employee compensation plans. common share repurchases under the 2015 capital plan began in the second quarter of
2015. during the second and third quarters of 2015, we completed $252 million of common share repurchases under this authorization. in addition, we completed $208 million of common share repurchases in the first quarter of 2015 under our 2014
capital plan for a total of $460 million of open market common share repurchases during 2015. we suspended our existing share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to the pending merger with first niagara. we plan to include share repurchases in the upcoming 2016 ccar submission.

39
¿                      the board declared a quarterly dividend of $.065 per common share for the first quarter of 2015. our 2015 capital plan proposed a 15% increase in our quarterly common share dividend to $.075 per share, which was approved by our board in may 2015. consistent with our 2015 capital plan, we made a dividend payment of $.075 per common share for each of the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2015, which brought our annual dividend to $.29 per common share for
2015. the board will consider an additional potential increase in our quarterly common share dividend, up to $.085 per share, in 2016 for the fifth quarter of the 2015 capital plan.

highlights of our 2015 performance financial performance for 2015, we announced net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders of $892 million, or $1.05 per common share. these results compare to net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders of $917 million, or $1.04 per common share, for 2014.

our 2016 expectations, as disclosed below, do not include the effect of the pending first niagara merger, which is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2016.
our 2015 full-year results reflect success in executing our strategy by generating positive operating leverage and maintaining strong risk management and disciplined capital management.
our taxable-equivalent net interest income for 2015 was $2.376 billion, and the net interest margin was 2.88%. these results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $2.317 billion and a net interest margin of 2.97% for the prior year. the increase in net interest income reflects higher earning asset balances, partially offset by lower earning asset yields, which also drove the decline in the net interest margin. in 2016, we expect low-single-digit (less than 5%) growth in net interest income without the benefit of higher interest rates or mid-single-digit (4% to 6%) growth with the benefit of higher interest rates compared to the prior year.
40
our noninterest income was $1.9 billion, up $83 million, or 4.6%, from 2014. investment banking and debt placement fees benefited from our business model and had a record high year, increasing $48 million from 2014. trust and investment services income increased $30 million, primarily due to the full-year 2015 impact of the september 2014 acquisition of pacific crest securities. noninterest income for 2015 also included increases of $20 million in corporate services income due to higher loan commitment fees and $17 million in cards and payments income due to higher merchant services, purchase card, and atm debit card fees driven by increased volume. other income also increased $10 million. these increases were partially offset by declines of $27 million in net gains from principal investing and $23 million in operating lease income and other leasing gains. in 2016, we expect mid-single-digit (4% to 6%) growth in noninterest income compared to 2015.
our noninterest expense was $2.8 billion, an increase of $79 million, or 2.9%, from 2014. we recognized $61 million of merger-, efficiency-, and pension-related charges in 2015 compared to $80 million of efficiency- and pension-related charges in 2014. personnel expense increased $61 million, driven by higher incentive and stock-based compensation, employee benefits, and salaries, partially offset by lower technology contract labor and severance. nonpersonnel expense increased $18 million, primarily due to increases in marketing of $8 million and computer processing of $6 million. in 2016, we expect noninterest expense to be relatively stable (plus or minus 2%) with 2015.
average loans totaled $58.6 billion for 2015, compared to $55.7 billion in 2014. commercial, financial and agricultural loan growth of $3.3 billion was broad-based across our commercial lines of business. consumer loans were slightly down, as modest increases across our core consumer loan portfolio, primarily direct term loans and credit cards, were offset by run-off in our designated consumer exit portfolio. for 2016, we anticipate average loan growth in the mid-single-digit (4% to 6%) range.
average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, totaled $70.1 billion for 2015, an increase of $2.9 billion compared to 2014. now and money market deposit accounts and demand deposits increased $2 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, reflecting growth in the commercial mortgage servicing business and inflows from commercial and consumer clients. these increases were partially offset by run-off in certificates of deposit and other time deposits. our consolidated loan to deposit ratio was 87.8% at december 31, 2015, compared to 84.6% at december 31, 2014.
we maintained credit discipline in 2015, and our asset quality ratios remained strong. the provision for credit losses was $166 million for 2015 compared to $57 million for 2014. the increase in our provision is due to the growth in our loan portfolio over the past twelve months as well as lower recoveries in 2015 compared to 2014. net loan charge-offs were $142 million, or .24%, of average loan balances for 2015, compared to $113 million, or .20%, for 2014. our nonperforming loans declined to $387 million, or .65%, of period-end loans at december 31, 2015, compared to $418 million, or .73%, at december 31, 2014. our alll was $796 million, or 1.33% of period-end loans, compared to $794 million, or 1.38%, at december 31, 2014, and represented 206% and 190% coverage of nonperforming loans at december 31, 2015, and december 31, 2014, respectively. in 2016, we expect net loan charge-offs to average loans to remain below our long-term targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points and the alll, as a percentage of period-end loans, to remain relatively stable (plus or minus 2%, which would approximate a three basis point change) with 2015.
our capital ratios remain strong. our tangible common equity and tier 1 risk-based capital ratios were 9.98% and 11.35%, respectively, at december 31, 2015, compared to 9.88% and 11.90%, respectively, at december 31, 2014. in addition, our common equity tier 1 was 10.94% at december 31, 2015. we have identified four primary uses of capital:
1.    investing in our businesses, supporting our clients, and loan growth;

2.    maintaining or increasing our common share dividend;

3.    returning capital in the form of common share repurchases to our shareholders; and

4.    remaining disciplined and opportunistic about how we invest in our franchise to include selective acquisitions over time.

41
our capital management remains focused on creating value. during 2015, our full-year dividend per common share increased 16% from the prior year, and we repurchased $460 million of common shares.
figure 4 presents certain non-gaap financial measures related to tangible common equity, return on tangible common equity, common equity tier 1, tier 1 common equity, pre-provision net revenue, cash efficiency ratio, and common equity tier 1 under the regulatory capital rules (estimates).
the tangible common equity ratio and the return on tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors, and management believes these ratios may assist investors in analyzing keys capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bhc capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. the federal reserve focuses its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of tier 1 capital known as common equity tier 1. because the federal reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders equity (essentially tier 1 risk-based capital less preferred stock, qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in tier 1 risk-based capital, this focus on common equity tier 1 is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories. the regulatory capital rules, described in more detail under the section supervision and regulation in item 1 of this report, also make common equity tier 1 a priority. the regulatory capital rules change the regulatory capital standards that apply to bhcs by, among other changes, phasing out the treatment of trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred securities as tier 1 eligible capital. starting in 2016, our trust preferred securities will only be included in tier 2 capital. since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and common equity tier 1, we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases. figure 4 also reconciles the gaap performance measures to the corresponding non-gaap measures.
figure 4 also shows the computation for and reconciliation of pre-provision net revenue, which is not formally defined by gaap. we believe that eliminating the effects of the provision for credit losses makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.
the cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two non-gaap performance measures. accordingly, there is no directly comparable gaap performance measure. the cash efficiency ratio excludes the impact of our intangible asset amortization from the calculation. we believe this ratio provides greater consistency and comparability between our results and those of our peer banks. additionally, this ratio is used by analysts and investors as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis.
non-gaap financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. although these non-gaap financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap.

results of operations net interest income one of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income. net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan-related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. there are several factors that affect net interest income, including:
¿   the volume, pricing, mix, and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities;

¿   the volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity capital;

¿   the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk;

¿   interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace; and

¿   asset quality.

to make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a taxable-equivalent basis (i.e.,
44
as if it were all taxable and at the same rate). for example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $154, an amount that  if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35%  would yield $100.
figure 5 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense, and their respective yields or rates over the past five years. this figure also presents a reconciliation of taxable-equivalent net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with gaap for each of those years. the net interest margin, which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio less cost of funding, is calculated by dividing taxable-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets.
taxable-equivalent net interest income for 2015 was $2.376 billion, and the net interest margin was 2.88%. these results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $2.317 billion and a net interest margin of 2.97% for the prior year. the $59 million increase in net interest income reflects higher earning asset balances, partially offset by lower earning asset yields, which also drove the decline in the net interest margin.
taxable-equivalent net interest income for 2014 decreased $31 million compared to 2013, and the net interest margin declined 15 basis points. the decreases in net interest income and the net interest margin were attributable to lower earning asset yields. loan growth, the maturity of higher-rate certificates of deposit, and a more favorable mix of lower-cost deposits and wholesale borrowings partially offset the impact of lower earning asset yields.
average earning assets totaled $82.5 billion for 2015, compared to $78.1 billion in 2014. contributing to the 2015 increase in average earning assets was average loan growth of $2.9 billion driven by commercial, financial and agricultural loans, which increased $3.3 billion and was broad-based across our commercial lines of business. in addition, our average securities available for sale portfolio increased $1.5 billion compared to 2014 due to higher levels of liquidity, driven by deposit growth and long-term debt issuances, which benefited keybanks lcr and credit ratings profile.
average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, totaled $70.1 billion for 2015, an increase of $2.9 billion compared to 2014. now and money market deposit accounts increased $2 billion, and demand deposits increased $1.9 billion, reflecting growth in the commercial mortgage servicing business and inflows from commercial and consumer clients. these increases were partially offset by run-off in certificates of deposit and other time deposits.

noninterest income as shown in figure 7, noninterest income for 2015 was $1.88 billion, up $83 million, or 4.6%, from 2014. investment banking and debt placement fees benefited from our business model and had a record year, increasing $48 million from 2014. trust and investment services income increased $30 million, primarily due to the full year 2015 impact of the september 2014 acquisition of pacific crest securities. noninterest income for 2015 also included increases of $20 million in corporate services income due to higher non-yield loan fees and dealer trading and derivatives income and $17 million in cards and payments income due to higher merchant services, purchase card, and atm debit card fees driven by increased volume. other income also increased $10 million. these increases were partially offset by declines of $27 million in net gains from principal investing and $23 million in operating lease income and other leasing gains.
in 2014, noninterest income increased $31 million, or 1.8%, compared to 2013. investment banking and debt placement fees increased $64 million from 2013. net gains from principal investing were $26 million higher than prior year, and trust and investment services income increased $10 million, primarily due to the september 2014 acquisition of pacific crest securities. these increases were partially offset by declines of $21 million in operating lease income and other leasing gains, $20 million in service charges on deposit accounts, $12 million in mortgage servicing fees, and $9 million in consumer mortgage income. other income also decreased $15 million.

(b)          the allocation between proprietary and nonproprietary is made based upon whether the trade is conducted for the benefit of key or keys clients rather than based upon rulemaking under the volcker rule. prohibitions and restrictions on proprietary trading activities imposed by the volcker rule became effective april 1, 2014. for more information, see the discussion under the heading other regulatory developments under the dodd-frank act 
volcker rule in the section entitled supervision and regulation in item 1 of this report.

the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused those elements to change.
trust and investment services income trust and investment services income is one of our largest sources of noninterest income and consists of brokerage commissions, trust and asset management commissions, and insurance income. the assets under management that primarily generate these revenues are shown in figure 9. for 2015, trust and investment services income increased $30 million, or 7.4%, from the prior year primarily due to the full year 2015 impact of the september 2014 acquisition of pacific crest securities. for 2014, trust and investment services income increased $10 million, or 2.5%, from the prior year.
a significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management. at december 31, 2015, our bank, trust, and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of $34.0 billion, compared to $39.2 billion at december 31, 2014, and $36.9 billion at december 31, 2013. as shown in figure 9, the decrease from 2014 to 2015 was primarily attributable to client attrition in the securities lending portfolio and market declines across all the portfolios. increases from 2013 to 2014 across all the portfolios were attributable to market appreciation.

investment banking and debt placement fees investment banking and debt placement fees consist of syndication fees, debt and equity financing fees, financial advisor fees, gains on sales of commercial mortgages, and agency origination fees. for 2015, investment banking and debt placement fees increased $48 million, or 12.1%, from the prior year. for 2014, investment banking and debt placement fees increased $64 million, or 19.2%, from the prior year. these increases were primarily driven by strength in syndication and financial advisory fees as well as the impact of the september 2014 acquisition of pacific crest securities.
service charges on deposit accounts service charges on deposit accounts declined $5 million, or 1.9%, in 2015 compared to the prior year and $20 million, or 7.1%, in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower overdraft charges resulting from changes in posting order.
operating lease income and other leasing gains operating lease income and other leasing gains decreased $23 million, or 24%, during 2015 compared to the prior year, and $21 million, or 17.9%, in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower gains on the early terminations of leveraged leases. figure 10 shows the corresponding operating lease expense related to the rental of leased equipment.
corporate services income corporate services income increased $20 million, or 11.2%, in 2015 compared to 2014 driven by higher non-yield loan fees and dealer trading and derivatives income. corporate services income increased $6 million, or 3.5%, in 2014 compared to 2013 driven by higher non-yield loan fees.
cards and payments income cards and payments income, which consists of debit card, consumer and commercial credit card, and merchant services income, increased $17 million, or 10.2 %, in 2015 compared to 2014 and $4 million, or 2.5%, in 2014 compared to 2013. the increases were due to higher merchant services, purchase card, and atm debit card fees driven by increased volume.
consumer mortgage income consumer mortgage income increased $2 million, or 20%, in 2015 compared to 2014. this increase was primarily driven by gains on the sales of consumer mortgage loans. consumer mortgage income decreased $9 million, or 47.4%, in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to lower mortgage originations caused by increasing mortgage interest rates.
50
mortgage servicing fees mortgage servicing fees increased $2 million, or 4.3%, in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower mortgage servicing fee amortization expense. mortgage servicing fees decreased $12 million, or 20.7%, in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower special servicing fees.
other income other income, which consists primarily of gains on sales of loans held for sale, other service charges, and certain dealer trading income, increased $10 million, or 22.7%, in 2015 compared to 2014, and decreased $15 million, or 25.4%, in 2014 compared to 2013 due to changes in various miscellaneous income categories.
noninterest expense as shown in figure 10, noninterest expense for 2015 was $2.84 billion, an increase of $79 million, or 2.9%, from 2014. we recognized $61 million of merger-, efficiency-, and pension-related charges in 2015 compared to $80 million of efficiency- and pension-related charges in 2014. as shown in figure 11, personnel expense increased $61 million, driven by higher incentive and stock-based compensation, employee benefits, and salaries, partially offset by lower technology contract labor and severance. nonpersonnel expense increased $18 million, primarily due to increases in marketing of $8 million and computer processing of $6 million.
noninterest expense for 2014 was $2.761 billion, a decrease of $51 million, or 1.8%, from 2013. we recognized $80 million of efficiency- and pension-related charges in 2014 compared to $117 million in 2013. we also recognized $22 million of noninterest expense in 2014 related to pacific crest securities, which we acquired during the third quarter of 2014. as shown in figure 11, personnel expense decreased by $18 million in 2014 due to declines in technology contract labor, severance, and employee benefits, partially offset by an increase in incentive and stock-based compensation. nonpersonnel expense decreased $33 million, primarily due to declines in net occupancy costs and equipment expense.

the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change.
personnel as shown in figure 11, personnel expense, the largest category of our noninterest expense, increased by $61 million, or 3.8%, in 2015 compared to 2014. increases in incentive and stock-based compensation of $30 million,
51
employee benefits of $26 million, and salaries of $21 million all contributed to the increase in personnel expense. these increases were partially offset by declines in technology contract labor of $10 million and severance of $6 million.
personnel expense decreased by $18 million, or 1.1%, from 2013 to 2014. declines in technology contract labor of $16 million, severance of $14 million, and employee benefits of $15 million all contributed to the decrease. these declines were partially offset by an increase in incentive and stock-based compensation of $27 million related to the performance of our business and the september 2014 acquisition of pacific crest securities.

(a)   excludes directors stock-based compensation of $1 million in 2015, $2 million in 2014, and $3 million in 2013, reported as other expense in figure 10.

net occupancy net occupancy expense decreased $6 million, or 2.3%, in 2015 compared to 2014, and $14 million, or 5.1%, in 2014 compared to 2013. these declines were primarily due to lower charges related to vacating leased property and a decrease in rental expenses.
operating lease expense operating lease expense increased $5 million, or 11.9%, in 2015 compared to 2014 due to increased depreciation expense on operating lease equipment related to new business. operating lease expense decreased $5 million, or 10.6%, in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to product run-off. income related to the rental of leased equipment is presented in figure 7 as operating lease income and other leasing gains.
other expense other expense comprises various miscellaneous expense items such as travel and entertainment, costs associated with technology service providers, and franchise and business taxes. other expense increased $10 million, or 3.0%, in 2015 compared to 2014, and declined $4 million, or 1.2%, in 2014 compared to 2013 due to fluctuations in several of those line items.
income taxes we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of $303 million for 2015, compared to a tax provision of $326 million for 2014, and $271 million for 2013. the effective tax rate, which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes, was 24.8% for 2015, compared to 25.6% for 2014, and 23.7% for 2013.
our federal tax (benefit) expense differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primarily because we generate income from investments in tax-advantaged assets, such as corporate-owned life insurance, earn credits associated with investments in low-income housing projects, and make periodic

adjustments to our tax reserves. in 2015, our effective tax rate was reduced by additional federal tax credit refunds filed for prior years. in addition, in 2014 and 2013, our effective tax rate was lower due to the early termination of certain leveraged leases that resulted in nontaxable gains pursuant to a prior settlement with the irs.
we recorded a valuation allowance of $.4 million at december 31, 2015, compared to $.3 million at december 31, 2014, and $1 million at december 31, 2013, against the gross deferred tax assets for certain state net operating loss and state credit carryforwards.
line of business results this section summarizes the financial performance and related strategic developments of our two major business segments (operating segments): key community bank and key corporate bank. note 23 (line of business results) describes the products and services offered by each of these business segments, provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the segments and certain lines of business, and explains other segments and reconciling items.
figure 12 summarizes the contribution made by each major business segment to our taxable-equivalent revenue from continuing operations and income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to key for each of the past three years.

key community bank summary of operations as shown in figure 13, key community bank recorded net income attributable to key of $256 million for 2015, compared to $242 million for 2014, and $197 million for 2013. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to growth in net interest income, as the value of deposits increased, and noninterest income, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses and noninterest expense.
taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $40 million, or 2.8%, from 2014. average loans and leases grew $729 million while average deposits increased $837 million compared to 2014. the positive contribution to
53
net interest income from loan and deposit growth and the increased value of deposits was partially offset by tightening credit spreads compared to one year ago.
noninterest income increased $20 million, or 2.6% from 2014. cards and payments income increased $16 million, or 10.5%, due to higher merchant services, purchase card, and atm debit card income driven by increased volume. trust and investment services income increased $5 million, or 1.7%, driven by higher insurance and brokerage commissions. investment banking and debt placement fees and consumer mortgage fees also contributed to the higher noninterest income. these increases in noninterest income were partially offset by lower service charges on deposit accounts of $5 million, primarily due to reduced overdraft fees, and a decrease in other miscellaneous income.
the provision for loan and lease losses increased $11 million, or 18.6%, from 2014, primarily due to loan growth. net loan charge-offs decreased $25 million from 2014 as a result of continued progress in the economic environment and further improvement in the credit quality of the portfolio.
noninterest expense increased $27 million, or 1.5%, from 2014. personnel expense increased $19 million, primarily due to increases in salaries and incentive and stock-based compensation. nonpersonnel expense increased $8 million, primarily due to increased marketing spend and other support costs.
in 2014, key community banks net income attributable to key increased $45 million from the prior year. taxable-equivalent net interest income declined $85 million from 2013. the positive contribution to net interest income from loan and deposit growth was offset by a reduction in the value of deposits in 2014 driven by the prolonged low-rate environment. noninterest income decreased $15 million from 2013. service charges on deposit accounts declined $19 million from 2013, primarily due to reduced overdraft fees resulting from changes in posting order. consumer mortgage income decreased $9 million from 2013 due to lower refinancing activity, and operating leasing income and other leasing gains declined $4 million. these decreases in noninterest income were partially offset by an $8 million increase in cards and payments income and a $9 million increase in other miscellaneous income. the provision for credit losses decreased $84 million. noninterest expense declined $87 million from 2013. personnel expense decreased primarily due to declines in salaries, incentive and stock-based compensation, and employee benefits expenses. nonpersonnel expense declined primarily due to decreases in outside loan servicing fees, computer processing, intangible asset amortization, and other support costs.

key corporate bank summary of operations as shown in figure 14, key corporate bank recorded net income attributable to key of $545 million for 2015, compared to $548 million for 2014 and $529 million for 2013. the 2015 decrease was driven by increases in the provision for credit losses and noninterest expense, partially offset by an increase in revenue.
taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $45 million, or 5.4%, in 2015 compared to 2014. the growth was primarily driven by a $45 million increase in the deposit and other borrowing spread due to a $2 billion increase in average deposit balances. earning asset spread increased $26 million due to a $2.9 billion increase in average loan and lease balances. these increases were partially offset by decreases in other components of net interest income.
noninterest income increased $120 million, or 14.9%, from 2014. investment banking and debt placement fees increased $47 million due to a full-year impact of the september 2014 pacific crest securities acquisition as well as the strength of our business model. trust and investment services income increased $25 million mostly due to the full-year impact of the pacific crest securities acquisition. corporate services income increased $23 million due to growth in non-yield loan fees associated with increases in loans, derivatives fees, and foreign exchange fees. other noninterest income increased $25 million mostly driven by gains related to the disposition of certain investments held by the real estate capital line of business and higher trading income.
the provision for credit losses increased $89 million, or 635.7%, from 2014, primarily due to a $2.9 billion increase in average loan and lease balances as well as a return to a more normal credit environment. net loan charge-offs increased $58 million from 2014 due to both higher charge-offs and lower recoveries in 2015.
noninterest expense increased $102 million, or 11.8%, from 2014. this increase was primarily driven by a $66 million increase in personnel expense due to higher incentive and stock-based compensation expense related to

the performance of the key corporate bank and the full-year impact of the september 2014 pacific crest securities acquisition. in addition, there were increases in various other expense categories related to higher staffing and volume levels.
in 2014, key corporate banks net income attributable to key increased $19 million from the prior year. taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $45 million in 2014 compared to 2013, as increases in earning asset spread from higher earning asset balances offset a decrease in deposit spread from a decline in rates. noninterest income increased $44 million as increases in investment banking and debt placement fees, corporate services income, and trust and investment services income more than offset decreases in mortgage servicing fees, trading income, and other noninterest income categories. the provision for credit losses decreased $4 million due to improved credit quality within the portfolio. noninterest expense increased $57 million mostly due to higher incentive compensation expense related to the performance of the key corporate bank and the partial-year impact of the september 2014 pacific crest securities acquisition, as well as increases in various other expense categories.

other segments other segments consist of corporate treasury, our principal investing unit, and various exit portfolios. other segments generated net income attributable to key of $124 million for 2015, compared to $158 million for both 2014 and 2013. taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased $33 million, and noninterest income declined $47 million compared to 2014, due to lower operating lease income and other leasing gains and gains from principal investments. these decreases in revenue were partially offset by a decline in noninterest expense of $23 million in 2015, primarily due to lower personnel expense.
in 2014, other segments net income attributable to key was flat from the prior year. taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $6 million and noninterest income increased $8 million. noninterest expense declined $6 million. these improvements were partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses of $11 million.

commercial, financial and agricultural loans increased $3.3 billion, or 11.6%, from december 31, 2014, with key corporate bank increasing $3 billion and key community bank up $340 million. we have experienced
59
growth in new high credit quality loan commitments and utilization with clients in our middle market segment and institutional and capital markets business. our two largest industry classifications  services and manufacturing  increased by 11.1% and 6.8%, respectively, when compared to one year ago. the services and manufacturing industries represented approximately 22% and 16%, respectively, of the total commercial, financial and agricultural loan portfolio at december 31, 2015, and approximately 22% and 17%, respectively, at december 31, 2014. at the end of 2015 and 2014, loans in the services and manufacturing industry classifications accounted for approximately 37% and 38%, respectively, of our total commercial, financial and agricultural loan portfolio.
services, manufacturing, and public utilities are focus areas where we maintain dedicated industry verticals that are staffed by relationship managers who possess deep industry experience and knowledge. our loans in the services classification grew by $669 million, or 11.1%, compared to last year. loans in the manufacturing classification grew by $316 million, or 6.8% compared to the same period one year ago. increases in lending to large corporate, middle market, and business banking clients accounted for the majority of the growth in this classification. loans in public utilities increased by $643 million, or 33.2%, compared to december 31, 2014, due to growth from our alternative energy and renewable energy clients.
our loans in the financial services and transportation classifications increased 8.1% and 20.2%, respectively, compared to the prior year. the increase in financial services loans was primarily attributable to growth in real estate investment trust balances. the increase in transportation loans was primarily attributable to loan growth for rail cars and shipping containers.
our oil and gas loan portfolio, included within the public utilities and mining industry classifications in figure 16, focuses on lending to middle market companies and represents approximately 2% of total loans outstanding at december 31, 2015. we have nearly 15 years of experience in energy lending with over 20 specialists dedicated to this sector, focusing on middle market companies, which is aligned with our relationship strategy.
the upstream segment, comprising oil and gas exploration and production, represents approximately one-half of our exposure, is primarily secured by oil and gas reserves, subject to a borrowing base, and regularly stress-tested. the midstream segment, comprising mostly distribution companies, has lower exposure to commodity risk. oil field services exposure is minimal and concentrated in very few borrowers. this mix was essentially unchanged from the prior year. our total commitments in the energy sector were approximately $3 billion at december 31, 2015, slightly lower than the prior year.
commercial real estate loans.    commercial real estate loans represent 15% of our total loan portfolio at december 31, 2015, compared to 16% at december 31, 2014. these commercial real estate loans, including both owner- and nonowner-occupied properties, represented 20% of our commercial loan portfolio at december 31, 2015, compared to 22% one year ago. these loans have decreased $135 million, or 1.5%, to $9 billion at december 31, 2015, from $9.1 billion at december 31, 2014. our commercial real estate lending business is conducted through two primary sources: our 12-state banking franchise, and keybank real estate capital, a national line of business that cultivates relationships with owners of commercial real estate located both within and beyond the branch system. this line of business deals primarily with nonowner-occupied properties (generally properties for which at least 50% of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties) and accounted for approximately 68% of our average year-to-date commercial real estate loans, compared to 61% one year ago. keybank real estate capital generally focuses on larger owners and operators of commercial real estate.
figure 17 includes commercial mortgage and construction loans in both key community bank and key corporate bank. as shown in figure 17, this loan portfolio is diversified by both property type and geographic location of the underlying collateral.
60
as presented in figure 17, at december 31, 2015, our commercial real estate portfolio included mortgage loans of $8 billion and construction loans of $1.1 billion, representing 13% and 2%, respectively, of our total loans. nonowner-occupied loans represented 11% of our total loans and owner-occupied loans represented 4% of our total loans. the average size of mortgage loans originated during 2015 was $5.5 million, and our largest mortgage loan at december 31, 2015, had a balance of $69.3 million. at december 31, 2015, our average construction loan commitment was $8.5 million. our largest construction loan commitment was $48 million, and our largest construction loan amount outstanding was $43 million.
also shown in figure 17, at december 31, 2015, 72% of our commercial real estate loans were for nonowner-occupied properties, compared to 70% at december 31, 2014. approximately 15% of these loans were construction loans at both december 31, 2015, and december 31, 2014. typically, these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan. the borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the construction loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments. a significant decline in economic growth, and in turn, in rental rates and occupancy, would adversely affect our portfolio of construction loans.

since december 31, 2014, our nonowner-occupied commercial real estate portfolio has increased by approximately $84 million, or 1.3%, as many of our clients have taken advantage of opportunities to permanently refinance their loans at historically low interest rates.

commercial lease financing.    we conduct commercial lease financing arrangements through our kef line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business. commercial lease financing receivables represented 9% of commercial loans at december 31, 2015, and 10% at december 31, 2014.
commercial loan modification and restructuring we modify and extend certain commercial loans in the normal course of business for our clients. loan modifications vary and are handled on a case-by-case basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower. in many cases, borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital, collateral, guarantees, or other income sources.
modifications are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients financing needs. modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not experiencing financial difficulties and under circumstances where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt are not classified as tdrs. in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, a loan is classified as a tdr only when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted.
our concession types are primarily interest rate reductions, forgiveness of principal, and other modifications. loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary concession types. because economic conditions have improved modestly and we have restructured loans to provide the optimal opportunity for successful repayment by the borrower, certain of our restructured loans have returned to accrual status and consistently performed under the restructured loan terms over the past year.
if loan terms are extended at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements, our asset recovery group is consulted to help determine if any concession granted would result in designation as a tdr. transfer to our asset recovery group is considered for any commercial loan determined to be a tdr. during 2015, we had $53 million of new restructured commercial loans compared to $22 million of new restructured commercial loans in 2014.
for more information on concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing tdrs, see note 5 (asset quality).

we often use an a-b note structure for our tdrs, breaking the existing loan into two tranches. first, we create an a note. since the objective of this tdr note structure is to achieve a fully performing and well-rated a note, we focus on sizing that note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to service debt at current market terms and consistent with our customary underwriting standards. this note structure typically will include a debt coverage ratio of 1.2 or better of cash flow to monthly payments of market interest, and principal amortization of generally not more than 25 years. these metrics are adjusted from time to time based upon changes in long-term markets and take-out underwriting standards of our various lines of business. appropriately sized a notes are more likely to return to accrual status, allowing us to resume recognizing interest income. as the borrowers payment performance improves, these restructured notes typically also allow for an upgraded internal quality risk rating classification.
62
the b note typically is a structurally subordinate note that may or may not require any debt service until the primary payment source stabilizes and generates excess cash flow. this excess cash flow customarily is captured for application to either the a note or b note dependent upon the terms of the restructure. we evaluate the b note when we consider returning the a note to accrual status. in many cases, the b note is charged off at the same time the a note is returned to accrual status in accordance with our interpretation of accounting and regulatory guidance applicable to tdrs. alternatively, both a and b notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit metrics are supportive.
restructured nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status based on a current, well-documented evaluation of the credit, which would include analysis of the borrowers financial condition, prospects for repayment under the modified terms, and alternate sources of repayment such as the value of loan collateral. we consider the borrowers ability to perform under the modified terms for a reasonable period (generally a minimum of six months) before returning the loan to accrual status. sustained historical repayment performance prior to the restructuring also may be taken into account. the primary consideration for returning a restructured loan to accrual status is the reasonable assurance that the full contractual principal balance of the loan and the ongoing contractually required interest payments will be fully repaid. although our policy is a guideline, considerable judgment is required to review each borrowers circumstances.
all loans processed as tdrs, including a notes and any non-charged-off b notes, are reported as tdrs during the calendar year in which the restructure took place. at december 31, 2015, we had $47 million and $7 million of a note and b note commercial tdrs, respectively.
additional information regarding tdrs is provided in note 5 (asset quality).
extensions.    project loans typically are refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity, but they are often modified and extended. extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship, the status of the project, and near-term prospects for the client, the repayment source, and the collateral. in all cases, pricing and loan structure are reviewed and, where necessary, modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms that are appropriate for the risk. typical enhancements include one or more of the following: principal pay down, increased amortization, additional collateral, increased guarantees, and a cash flow sweep. some maturing loans have automatic extension options built in; in those cases, pricing and loan terms cannot be altered.
loan pricing is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity, the strength of the guarantor, if any, and the structure and residual risk of the transaction. therefore, pricing for an extended loan may remain the same because the loan is already priced at or above current market.
we do not consider loan extensions in the normal course of business (under existing loan terms or at market rates) as tdrs, particularly when ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt and no concession has been made. in the case of loan extensions where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made, we would analyze such credit under the applicable accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a tdr. extensions that qualify as tdrs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance.
guarantors.    we conduct a detailed guarantor analysis (1) for all new extensions of credit, (2) at the time of any material modification/extension, and (3) typically annually, as part of our on-going portfolio and loan monitoring procedures. this analysis requires the guarantor entity to submit all appropriate financial statements, including balance sheets, income statements, tax returns, and real estate schedules.
while the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may vary, the high-level objectives include determining the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities, including size, quality, and nature of asset base; net worth (adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value); leverage; standing liquidity; recurring cash flow; contingent and direct debt obligations; and near-term debt maturities.
63
borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within 90-120 days of the calendar/fiscal year end. income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly. we may require certain information, such as liquidity, certifications, status of asset sales or debt resolutions, and real estate schedules, to be provided more frequently.
we routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt if the guarantor is solvent. we may not seek to enforce the guaranty if we are precluded by bankruptcy or we determine the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantors verified financial condition. we often are successful in obtaining either monetary payment or the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss, cost, and the expense of collections.
mortgage and construction loans with a loan-to-value ratio greater than 1.0 are accounted for as performing loans. these loans were not considered impaired due to one or more of the following factors: (i) underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization; (ii) a satisfactory borrower payment history; and (iii) acceptable guarantor support. as of december 31, 2015, we did not have any mortgage and construction loans that had a loan-to-value ratio greater than 1.0.
consumer loan portfolio consumer loans outstanding decreased by $396 million, or 2.5%, from one year ago. the home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio. approximately 98% of this portfolio at december 31, 2015, was originated from key community bank within our 12-state footprint. the remainder of the portfolio, which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of 2007, was originated from the consumer finance line of business and is now included in other segments. home equity loans in key community bank decreased by $239 million, or 2.3%, over the past 12 months.
as shown in figure 13, we hold the first lien position for approximately 61% of the key community bank home equity portfolio at december 31, 2015, and 60% at december 31, 2014. for consumer loans with real estate collateral, we track borrower performance monthly. regardless of the lien position, credit metrics are refreshed quarterly, including recent fair isaac corporation scores as well as original and updated loan-to-value ratio. this information is used in establishing the alll. our methodology is described in note 1 (summary of significant accounting policies) under the heading allowance for loan and lease losses.
regulatory guidance issued in january 2012 addressed specific risks and required actions within home equity portfolios associated with second lien loans. this regulatory guidance related to the classification of second lien home equity loans was implemented prospectively, and therefore prior periods were not adjusted. at december 31, 2015, 39% of our home equity portfolio is secured by second lien mortgages. on at least a quarterly basis, we continue to monitor the risk characteristics of these loans when determining whether our loss estimation methods are appropriate.

(a)   includes $48 million of performing home equity second liens that are subordinate to first liens and 120 days or more past due or in foreclosure, or for which the first mortgage delinquency timeframe is unknown. such second liens are now being reported as nonperforming loans based upon regulatory guidance issued in january 2012.

(b)   includes $72 million of performing secured loans that were discharged through chapter 7 bankruptcy and not formally re-affirmed as addressed in regulatory guidance that was updated in the third quarter of 2012. such loans have been designated as nonperforming and tdrs.

loans held for sale as shown in note 4 (loans and loans held for sale), our loans held for sale were $639 million at december 31, 2015, compared to $734 million at december 31, 2014. during 2015, we recorded net gains from loan sales of $103 million. there were no loans held for sale related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business at december 31, 2015, and december 31, 2014.
at december 31, 2015, loans held for sale included $532 million of commercial mortgages, which decreased by $106 million from december 31, 2014, $76 million of commercial, financial and agricultural loans, which increased by $13 million from december 31, 2014, $17 million of residential mortgage loans, which decreased by $1 million from december 31, 2014, and $14 million of commercial lease financing, which decreased by $1 million from december 31, 2014. valuations are conducted using internal models that rely on market data from sales or nonbinding bids on similar assets, including credit spreads, treasury rates, interest rate curves and risk profiles, as well as our own assumptions about the exit market for the loans and details about individual loans within the respective portfolios. we review our assumptions quarterly. for additional information related to the valuation of loans held for sale, see note 6 (fair value measurements).
loan sales as shown in figure 20, during 2015, we sold $6.0 billion of commercial real estate loans, $415 million of commercial lease financing loans, $554 million of residential real estate loans, and $335 million of commercial loans. most of these sales came from the held-for-sale portfolio.
among the factors that we consider in determining which loans to sell are:
¿   our business strategy for particular lending areas;

¿   whether particular lending businesses meet established performance standards or fit with our relationship banking strategy;

¿   our a/lm needs;

65
¿   the cost of alternative funding sources;

¿   the level of credit risk;

¿   capital requirements; and

¿   market conditions and pricing.

(a)                 during the third quarter of 2014, we sold the residual interests in all of our outstanding education loan securitization trusts to a third party. at september 30, 2014, we deconsolidated the securitization trusts and removed the trust assets from our balance sheet. we retained the servicing for the loans associated with these securitization trusts. see note 13 (acquisitions and discontinued operations) for more information about this transaction.

in the event of default by a borrower, we are subject to recourse with respect to approximately $1.8 billion of the $214 billion of loans administered or serviced at december 31, 2015. additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in note 20 (commitments, contingent liabilities and guarantees) under the heading recourse agreement with fnma.
we derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold. we earn noninterest income (recorded as other income) from fees for servicing or administering loans. this fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. in addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of commercial real estate loans. additional information about our mortgage servicing assets is included in note 9 (mortgage servicing assets).

securities our securities portfolio totaled $19.1 billion at december 31, 2015, compared to $18.4 billion at december 31, 2014. available-for-sale securities were $14.2 billion at december 31, 2015, compared to $13.4 billion at december 31, 2014. held-to-maturity securities were $4.9 billion at december 31, 2015, compared to $5 billion at december 31, 2014.
as shown in figure 23, all of our mortgage-backed securities, which include both securities available for sale and held-to-maturity securities, are issued by government-sponsored enterprises or gnma, and are traded in liquid secondary markets. these securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value for the available-for-sale portfolio and at cost for the held-to-maturity portfolio. for more information about these securities, see note 6 (fair value measurements) under the heading qualitative disclosures of valuation techniques, and note 7 (securities).

securities available for sale the majority of our securities available-for-sale portfolio consists of federal agency cmos and mortgage-backed securities. cmos are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. these mortgage securities generate interest income, serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements, and
67
provide liquidity value under regulatory requirements. at december 31, 2015, we had $14.2 billion invested in cmos and other mortgage-backed securities in the available-for-sale portfolio, compared to $13.3 billion at december 31, 2014.
we periodically evaluate our securities available-for-sale portfolio in light of established a/lm objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, the regulatory environment, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. these evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning.
in addition, the size and composition of our securities available-for-sale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required (or elect) to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits. although we generally use debt securities for this purpose, other assets, such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit, are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles.
throughout 2014 and 2015, our investing activities continued to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs. our actions to not reinvest the monthly security cash flows at various times during this time period served to provide the liquidity necessary to address our funding requirements. these funding requirements included ongoing loan growth and occasional debt maturities. at other times, we may make additional investments that go beyond the replacement of maturities or mortgage security cash flows as our liquidity position and/or interest rate risk management strategies may require. lastly, our focus on investing in gnma-related securities is also related to liquidity management strategies as we continue to prepare for future regulatory requirements.

other investments principal investments  investments in equity and debt instruments made by our principal investing unit  represented 46% and 53% of other investments at december 31, 2015, and december 31, 2014, respectively. they include direct investments (investments made in a particular company) as well as indirect investments (investments made through funds that include other investors). principal investments are predominantly made in privately held companies and are carried at fair value. the fair value of the direct investments was $69 million at december 31, 2015, and $104 million at december 31, 2014, while the fair value of the indirect investments was $235 million at december 31, 2015, and $302 million at december 31, 2014. under the requirements of the volcker rule, we will be required to dispose of some or all of our indirect principal investments. the federal reserve extended the conformance period to july 21, 2016, for all banking entities with respect to covered funds. the federal reserve also indicated its intent to exercise the authority granted by section 13 of the bank holding company act to grant the final one-year extension until july 21, 2017. if this authority is not exercised by the federal reserve, key is permitted to file for an additional extension of up to five years for illiquid funds, to retain the indirect investments for a longer period of time. we plan to apply for the extension, if not granted automatically, and hold the investments. as of december 31, 2015, we have not committed to a plan to sell these investments. for more information about the volcker rule, see the discussion in item 1 under the heading other regulatory developments under the dodd-frank act  volcker rule in the section entitled supervision and regulation.
in addition to principal investments, other investments include other equity and mezzanine instruments, such as certain real-estate-related investments and an indirect ownership interest in a partnership, that are carried at fair value, as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at cost. the real-estate-related investments were valued at $8 million at december 31, 2015, and $10 million at december 31, 2014. the indirect investment
69
in a partnership was valued at $4 million at december 31, 2014. under the requirements of the volcker rule, we were required to dispose of this investment. prior to december 31, 2015, the investment was redeemed. additional information pertaining to the equity investment is included in the changes in level 3 fair value measurements section of note 6 (fair value measurements).
most of our other investments are not traded on an active market. we determine the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment and all available relevant information. this review may encompass such factors as the issuers past financial performance and future potential, the values of public companies in comparable businesses, the risks associated with the particular business or investment type, current market conditions, the nature and duration of resale restrictions, the issuers payment history, our knowledge of the industry, third-party data, and other relevant factors. as of december 31, 2015, net gains from our principal investing activities (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) totaled $51 million, which includes $47 million of net unrealized losses. these net gains are recorded as net gains (losses) from principal investing on the income statement. additional information regarding these investments is provided in note 6.
deposits and other sources of funds domestic deposits are our primary source of funding. the composition of our average deposits is shown in figure 5 in the section entitled net interest income. during 2015, average domestic deposits were $70.1 billion and represented 85% of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets, compared to $67.3 billion and 86% during 2014. now and money market deposit accounts increased $2.0 billion, and noninterest-bearing deposits increased $1.9 billion, reflecting continued growth in the commercial mortgage servicing business and inflows from commercial and consumer clients. these increases were partially offset by a decline in certificates of deposit.
wholesale funds, consisting of deposits in our foreign office and short-term borrowings, averaged $1.7 billion during 2015, compared to $2.4 billion during 2014. the decrease from 2014 was caused by declines of $550 million in federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, $126 million in foreign office deposits, and $25 million in bank notes and other short-term borrowings.
at december 31, 2015, we had $2.4 billion in time deposits of $100,000 or more. figure 26 shows the maturity distribution of these deposits.

ccar and capital actions as part of its ongoing supervisory process, the federal reserve requires bhcs like keycorp to submit an annual comprehensive capital plan and to update that plan to reflect material changes in the bhcs risk profile, business strategies, or corporate structure, including but not limited to changes in planned capital actions. in january 2015, we submitted to the federal reserve and provided to the occ our 2015 capital plan under the annual ccar process. on march 11, 2015, the federal reserve announced that it did not object to our 2015 capital plan. the 2015 capital plan includes a common share repurchase program of up to $725 million, which includes repurchases to offset issuances of common shares under our employee compensation plans. common share repurchases under the 2015 capital plan began in the second quarter of 2015 and were suspended in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to the pending merger with first niagara. share repurchases are expected to be included in the upcoming 2016 ccar submission.
during 2015, we repurchased $252 million of common shares under our 2015 capital plan authorization. in addition, during the first quarter of 2015, we repurchased $208 million of common shares under our 2014 capital plan for a total of $460 million of common share repurchases during 2015.
dividends as previously reported, our 2015 capital plan proposed an increase in our quarterly common share dividend from $.065 to $.075 per share, which was approved by our board in may 2015. an additional potential increase in our quarterly common share dividend, up to $.085 per share, will be considered by the board in 2016 for the fifth quarter of the 2015 capital plan. other changes to future dividends may be evaluated by the board based upon our earnings, financial condition, and other factors, including regulatory review. further information regarding the capital planning process and ccar is included in the supervision and regulation section of item 1 of this report under the heading regulatory capital and liquidity.
consistent with the 2015 capital plan, we made a dividend payment of $.075 per share during each of the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2015, totalling $189 million, and a dividend payment of $.065 per share, or $55 million, during the first quarter of 2015.
we also made quarterly dividend payments of $1.9375 per share on our series a preferred stock during each quarter of 2015 for a total of $23 million.
common shares outstanding our common shares are traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol key with 27,058 holders of record at december 31, 2015. our book value per common share was $12.51 based on 835.8 million shares outstanding at december 31, 2015, compared to $11.91 based on 859.4 million shares outstanding at december 31, 2014. at december 31, 2015, our tangible book value per common share was $11.22, compared to $10.65 at december 31, 2014.

at december 31, 2015, we had 181.2 million treasury shares, compared to 157.6 million treasury shares at december 31, 2014. during 2015, common shares outstanding decreased by 24 million shares due to common share repurchases under our 2014 and 2015 capital plans, partially offset by the net share activity under our employee benefit plans and shares of series a preferred stock that were exchanged for common shares. going forward, we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stock-based compensation awards and for other corporate purposes.
as discussed in further detail in the supervision and regulation section in item 1 of this report under the heading capital planning and stress testing, we are required to annually submit a capital plan to the federal reserve setting forth planned capital actions, including any share repurchases our board of directors and management intend to make during the year (subject to the federal reserves notice of non-objection). pursuant to that requirement, we will submit our 2016 capital plan to the federal reserve for review in april 2016.
capital adequacy capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. all of our capital ratios remained in excess of regulatory requirements at december 31, 2015. our capital and liquidity levels are intended to position us to weather an adverse credit cycle while continuing to serve our clients needs, as well as to meet the regulatory capital rules described in the supervision and regulation section of item 1 of this report. our shareholders equity to assets ratio was 11.30% at december 31, 2015, compared to 11.22% at december 31, 2014. our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 9.98% at december 31, 2015, compared to 9.88% at december 31, 2014.

federal banking regulators have promulgated minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements for bhcs like keycorp and their banking subsidiaries like keybank. as of january 1, 2015, key and keybank (consolidated) were each required to maintain a minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.00%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.00%, and a tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.00%. at december 31, 2015, our tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, and tier 1 leverage ratio were 11.35%, 12.97%, and 10.72%, respectively, compared to 11.90%, 13.89%, and 11.26%, respectively, at december 31, 2014. in addition, as of january 1, 2015, key and keybank (consolidated) were each required to maintain a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%. at december 31, 2015, our common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 10.94%.
the adoption of the regulatory capital rules changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bhcs by phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities as eligible tier 1 capital. the phase-out period, which began january 1, 2015, for standardized approach banking organizations such as keycorp, will result in our trust preferred securities issued by the keycorp capital trusts being treated only as tier 2 capital starting in 2016. the trust preferred securities issued by the keycorp capital trusts contribute $85 million, or 9 basis points, to our tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.35% and tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.72% at december 31, 2015. the trust preferred securities contribute $340 million, or 38 basis points, to our total risk-based capital ratio of 12.97% at december 31, 2015. the new minimum capital and leverage ratios under the regulatory capital rules together with the estimated ratios of key at december 31, 2015, calculated on a fully phased-in basis, are set forth under the heading new minimum capital and leverage ratio requirements in the supervision and regulation section in item 1 of this report.
as previously indicated in the supervision and regulation section of item 1 of this report under the heading revised prompt corrective action capital category ratios, the prompt corrective action capital category regulations do not apply to bhcs. if, however, these regulations did apply to bhcs, we believe keycorp would qualify for the well capitalized capital category at december 31, 2015. moreover, after accounting for the phase-out of our trust preferred securities as tier 1 eligible (and as tier 2 instead) as of december 31, 2015, we estimate keycorp would still qualify for the well capitalized capital category under the regulatory capital rules, with an estimated tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, estimated tier 1 leverage ratio, estimated common equity tier 1 capital ratio, and estimated total risk-based capital ratio of 11.26%, 10.63%, 10.94%, and 12.97%, respectively. the new threshold ratios for a well capitalized and an adequately capitalized institution under the regulatory capital rules are described in the supervision and regulation section of item 1 of this report under the heading revised prompt corrective action capital category ratios. since the regulatory capital categories under these regulations serve a limited supervisory function, investors should not use them as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of keycorp. a discussion of the regulatory capital standards and other related capital adequacy regulatory standards is included in the section regulatory capital and liquidity in supervision and regulation under item 1 of this report.
traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bhc capital adequacy based on both the amount and composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. the federal reserves assessment of capital adequacy previously focused on a component of tier 1 risk-based capital, known as tier 1 common equity, and its review of the consolidated capitalization of sifis, including keycorp. the capital modifications mandated by the regulatory capital rules, which became effective on january 1, 2015, for key, require higher and better-quality capital and introduced a new capital measure, common equity tier 1. common equity tier 1 is not formally defined by gaap and is considered to be a non-gaap financial measure. figure 4 in the highlights of our performance section reconciles key shareholders equity, the gaap performance measure, to common equity tier 1, the corresponding non-gaap measure. our common equity tier 1 ratio was 10.94% at december 31, 2015.
at december 31, 2015, for keys consolidated operations, we had a federal net deferred tax asset of $289 million and a state deferred tax asset of $32 million, compared to a federal net deferred tax asset of $195 million and a state deferred tax asset of $22 million at december 31, 2014. we had a valuation allowance against the gross deferred tax assets associated with certain state net operating loss carryforwards and state credit carryforwards of
73
less than $1 million at december 31, 2015, and at december 31, 2014. starting with the implementation of the regulatory capital rules on january 1, 2015, deferred tax assets that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are deductible from common equity tier 1 on a phase-in basis. as of december 31, 2015, this balance was approximately $1 million.

off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations off-balance sheet arrangements we are party to various types of off-balance sheet arrangements, which could lead to contingent liabilities or risks of loss that are not reflected on the balance sheet.
variable interest entities a vie is a partnership, limited liability company, trust, or other legal entity that meets any one of the following criteria:
¿   the entity does not have sufficient equity to conduct its activities without additional subordinated financial support from another party.

¿   the entitys investors lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance.

¿   the entitys equity at risk holders do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive residual returns.

¿   the voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their economic interests in the entity, and substantially all of the entitys activities involve, or are conducted on behalf of, investors with disproportionately few voting rights.

in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations, we consolidate a vie if we have: (i) a variable interest in the entity; (ii) the power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance; and (iii) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie (i.e., we are considered to be the primary beneficiary). additional information regarding the nature of vies and our involvement with them is included in note 1 (summary of significant accounting policies) under the heading basis of presentation, and in note 11 (variable interest entities).
we use the equity method to account for unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or vies if we have significant influence over the entitys operating and financing decisions (usually defined as a voting or economic interest of 20% to 50%, but not controlling). unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or vies in which we have a voting or economic interest of less than 20% generally are carried at cost. investments held by our registered broker-dealer and investment company subsidiaries (primarily principal investments) are carried at fair value.
commitments to extend credit or funding loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria. these commitments generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. we typically charge a fee for our loan commitments. since a commitment may expire without resulting in a loan or being fully utilized, the total amount of an outstanding commitment may significantly exceed any related cash outlay. further information about our loan commitments at december 31, 2015, is presented in note 20 (commitments, contingent liabilities and guarantees) under the heading commitments to extend credit or funding. figure 31 shows the remaining contractual amount of each class of commitment to extend credit or funding. for loan commitments and commercial letters of credit, this amount represents our maximum possible accounting loss on the unused commitment if the borrower were to draw upon the full amount of the commitment and subsequently default on payment for the total amount of the then outstanding loan.
76
other off-balance sheet arrangements other off-balance sheet arrangements include financial instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, and other relationships, such as liquidity support provided to asset-backed commercial paper conduits, indemnification agreements and intercompany guarantees. information about such arrangements is provided in note 20 under the heading other off-balance sheet risk.
contractual obligations figure 31 summarizes our significant contractual obligations, and lending-related and other off-balance sheet commitments at december 31, 2015, by the specific time periods in which related payments are due or commitments expire.

guarantees we are a guarantor in various agreements with third parties. as guarantor, we may be contingently liable to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in a specified interest rate, foreign exchange rate or other variable (including the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event). these variables, known as underlyings, may be related to an asset or liability, or another entitys failure to perform under a contract. additional information regarding these types of arrangements is presented in note 20 under the heading guarantees.
risk management overview like all financial services companies, we engage in business activities and assume the related risks. the most significant risks we face are credit, compliance, operational, liquidity, market, reputation, strategic, and model risks. our risk management activities are focused on ensuring we properly identify, measure, and manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability. certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section.
the board serves in an oversight capacity ensuring that keys risks are managed in a manner that is effective and balanced and adds value for the shareholders. the board understands keys risk philosophy, approves the risk appetite, inquires about risk practices, reviews the portfolio of risks, compares the actual risks to the risk appetite, and is apprised of significant risks, both actual and emerging, and determines whether management is responding appropriately. the board challenges management and ensures accountability.
the boards audit committee assists the board in oversight of financial statement integrity, regulatory and legal requirements, independent auditors qualifications and independence, and the performance of the internal audit function and independent auditors. the audit committee meets with management and approves significant policies relating to the risk areas overseen by the audit committee. the audit committee has responsibility over all risk review functions, including internal audit, as well as financial reporting, legal matters, and fraud risk. the audit committee also receives reports on enterprise risk. in addition to regularly scheduled bi-monthly meetings, the audit committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases.
the boards risk committee assists the board in oversight of strategies, policies, procedures, and practices relating to the assessment and management of enterprise-wide risk, including credit, market, liquidity, model, operational, compliance, reputation, and strategic risks. the risk committee also assists the board in overseeing risks related to capital adequacy, capital planning, and capital actions. the risk committee reviews and provides oversight of managements activities related to the enterprise-wide risk management framework, which includes review of the erm policy, including the risk appetite statement, and management and erm reports. the risk committee also approves any material changes to the charter of the erm committee and significant policies relating to risk management.
the audit and risk committees meet jointly, as appropriate, to discuss matters that relate to each committees responsibilities. committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting. all members of the board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months.
our erm committee, chaired by the chief executive officer and comprising other senior level executives, is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. the erm program encompasses our risk philosophy, policy, framework, and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company. the erm committee reports to the boards
78
risk committee. annually, the board reviews and approves the erm policy, as well as the risk appetite, including corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories. we use a risk-adjusted capital framework to manage risks. this framework is approved and managed by the erm committee.
tier 2 risk governance committees support the erm committee by identifying early warning events and trends, escalating emerging risks, and discussing forward-looking assessments. risk governance committees include attendees from each of the three lines of defense. the first line of defense is the line of business primarily responsible to accept, own, proactively identify, monitor, and manage risk. the second line of defense comprises risk management representatives who provide independent, centralized oversight over all risk categories by aggregating, analyzing, and reporting risk information. risk review, our internal audit function, provides the third line of defense in their role to provide independent assessment and testing of the effectiveness, appropriateness, and adherence to keycorps risk management policies, practices, and controls.
the chief risk officer ensures that relevant risk information is properly integrated into strategic and business decisions, ensures appropriate ownership of risks, provides input into performance and compensation decisions, assesses aggregate enterprise risk, monitors capabilities to manage critical risks, and executes appropriate board and stakeholder reporting.
federal banking regulators continue to emphasize with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution. we believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks, and conform to regulatory expectations.
market risk management market risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, and volatilities will reduce keys income and the value of its portfolios. these factors influence prospective yields, values, or prices associated with the instrument. for example, the value of a fixed-rate bond will decline when market interest rates increase, while the cash flows associated with a variable rate loan will increase when interest rates increase. the holder of a financial instrument is exposed to market risk when either the cash flows or the value of the instrument is tied to such external factors.
we are exposed to market risk both in our trading and nontrading activities, which include asset and liability management activities. our trading positions are carried at fair value with changes recorded in the income statement. these positions are subject to various market-based risk factors that impact the fair value of the financial instruments in the trading category. our traditional banking loan and deposit products as well as long-term debt and certain short-term borrowings are nontrading positions. these positions are generally carried at the principal amount outstanding for assets and the amount owed for liabilities. the nontrading positions are subject to changes in economic value due to varying market conditions, primarily changes in interest rates.
trading market risk key incurs market risk as a result of trading, investing, and client facilitation activities, principally within our investment banking and capital markets businesses. key has exposures to a wide range of interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and commodity prices, as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads. our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading activities in the derivative and fixed income markets and maintaining positions in these instruments. we maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow, make markets in securities, and hedge certain risks. the majority of our positions are traded in active markets.
79
management of trading market risks.    market risk management is an integral part of keys risk culture. the risk committee of our board provides oversight of trading market risks. the erm committee and the market risk committee regularly review and discuss market risk reports prepared by our mrm that contain our market risk exposures and results of monitoring activities. market risk policies and procedures have been defined and approved by the market risk committee, a tier 2 risk governance committee, and take into account our tolerance for risk and consideration for the business environment.
the mrm is an independent risk management function that partners with the lines of business to identify, measure, and monitor market risks throughout our company. the mrm is responsible for ensuring transparency of significant market risks, monitoring compliance with established limits, and escalating limit exceptions to appropriate senior management. the various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well-managed and prudent. market risk is monitored through various measures, such as var, and through routine stress testing, sensitivity, and scenario analyses. the mrm conducts stress tests for each covered position using historical worst case and standard shock scenarios. var, stressed var, and other analyses are prepared daily and distributed to appropriate management.
covered positions.    we monitor the market risk of our covered positions, which includes all of our trading positions as well as all foreign exchange and commodity positions, regardless of whether the position is in a trading account. all positions in the trading account are recorded at fair value, and changes in fair value are reflected in our consolidated statements of income. information regarding our fair value policies, procedures, and methodologies is provided in note 1 (summary of significant accounting policies) under the heading fair value measurements, and note 6 (fair value measurements) in this report. instruments that are used to hedge nontrading activities, such as bank-issued debt and loan portfolios, equity positions that are not actively traded, and securities financing activities, do not meet the definition of a covered position. the mrm is responsible for identifying our portfolios as either covered or non-covered. the covered position working group develops the final list of covered positions, and a summary is provided to the market risk committee.
our significant portfolios of covered positions are detailed below. we analyze market risk by portfolios of covered positions, and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type. the descriptions below incorporate the respective risk types associated with each of these portfolios.
¿                     fixed income includes those instruments associated with our capital markets business and the trading of securities as a dealer. these instruments may include positions in municipal bonds, bonds backed by the u.s.
government, agency and corporate bonds, certain mortgage-backed securities, securities issued by the u.s. treasury, money markets, and certain cmos. the activities and instruments within the fixed income portfolio create exposures to interest rate and credit spread risks.

¿   interest rate derivatives include interest rate swaps, caps, and floors, which are transacted primarily to accommodate the needs of commercial loan clients. in addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives to offset or mitigate the interest rate risk related to the client positions. the activities within this portfolio create exposures to interest rate risk.

¿   credit derivatives generally include credit default swap indexes, which are used to manage the credit risk exposure associated with anticipated sales of certain commercial real estate loans. the transactions within the credit derivatives portfolio result in exposure to counterparty credit risk and market risk.

var and stressed var.    var is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level. stressed var is used to assess extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios. mrm calculates var and stressed var on a daily basis, and the results are distributed to appropriate management. var and stressed var results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations.
we use a historical var model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions. historical scenarios
80
are customized for specific covered positions, and numerous risk factors are incorporated in the calculation. additional consideration is given to the risk factors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features, such as options and cancelable provisions. var is calculated using daily observations over a one-year time horizon, and approximates a 95% confidence level. statistically, this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than var, on average, five out of 100 trading days, or three to four times each quarter. we also calculate var and stressed var at a 99% confidence level.
the var model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of possible gains and losses on our covered positions. however, there are limitations inherent in the var model since it uses historical results over a given time interval to estimate future performance. historical results may not be indicative of future results, and changes in the market or composition of our portfolios could have a significant impact on the accuracy of the var model. we regularly review and enhance the modeling techniques, inputs and assumptions used. our market risk policy includes the independent validation of our var model by keys risk management group on an annual basis. the model risk management committee oversees the model validation program, and results of validations are discussed with the erm committee.
actual losses for the total covered positions did not exceed aggregate daily var on any day during the quarters ended december 31, 2015, and december 31, 2014. the mrm backtests our var model on a daily basis to evaluate its predictive power. the test compares var model results at the 99% confidence level to daily held profit and loss. results of backtesting are provided to the market risk committee. backtesting exceptions occur when trading losses exceed var.
we do not engage in correlation trading, or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk. our net var approach incorporates diversification, but our var calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and our own credit spreads on derivatives.
the aggregate var at the 99% confidence level for all covered positions was $1.2 million at december 31, 2015, and $.9 million at december 31, 2014. the increase in aggregate var was primarily due to the increased exposure in our credit derivative portfolio, and the composition of our fixed income portfolio. figure 32 summarizes our var at the 99% confidence level for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended december 31, 2015, and december 31, 2014. during this period, none of our significant portfolios daily trading var numbers exceeded their var limits or stress var limits.

internal capital adequacy assessment.    market risk is a component of our internal capital adequacy assessment. our risk-weighted assets include a market risk-equivalent asset position, which consists of a var component, stressed var component, a de minimis exposure amount, and a specific risk add-on, which are added together to arrive at total market risk equivalent assets. specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments, which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach. specific risk calculations are run quarterly by the mrm, and approved by the chief market risk officer.
nontrading market risk most of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products, as well as investments, hedging relationships, long-term debt, and certain short-term borrowings. interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the eve. such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the eve in accordance with our risk appetite and within board-approved policy limits.
interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of consumer preferences for loan and deposit products, economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets, changes in market interest rates that affect client activity, and our hedging, investing, funding, and capital positions. the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of reprice risk, basis risk, yield curve risk, and option risk.
the management of nontrading market risk is centralized within corporate treasury. the risk committee of our board provides oversight of nontrading market risk. the erm committee and the alco review reports on the components of interest rate risk described above as well as sensitivity analyses of these exposures. these committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk, including recommending, approving, and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges. the a/lm policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the alco. internal and external emerging issues are monitored on a daily basis. the mrm, as the second line of defense, provides additional oversight.
¿   reprice risk is the exposure to changes in interest rates and occurs when the volume of interest-bearing liabilities and the volume of interest-earning assets they fund (e.g., deposits used to fund loans) do not mature or reprice at the same time.

¿   basis risk is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indexes and occurs when floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities reprice at the same time, but in response to different market factors or indexes.

¿   yield curve risk is the exposure to non-parallel changes in the slope of the yield curve (where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity) and occurs when interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets that they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve.

82
¿                                      option risk is the exposure to a customer or counterpartys ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets, liabilities, or off-balance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty. option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation.

net interest income simulation analysis.    the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis. for purposes of this analysis, we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on- and off-balance sheet positions, accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity. the analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments, including a most likely macro-economic scenario. simulation modeling assumes that residual risk exposures will be managed to within the risk appetite and board-approved policy limits.
we measure the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if the federal funds target rate were to gradually increase or decrease over the next 12 months, and term rates were to move in a similar direction, although at a slower pace. our standard rate scenarios encompass a gradual increase or decrease of 200 basis points, but due to the low interest rate environment, we have modified the standard to a gradual decrease of 50 basis points over three months with no change over the following nine months. after calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes, we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment. we also perform regular stress tests and sensitivities on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments. one set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of interest rate inputs on simulated exposures. assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve, including steepening or flattening of the yield curve, changes in credit spreads, an immediate parallel change in market interest rates, and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates. another set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of loan and deposit assumptions and assumed discretionary strategies on simulated exposures. assessments are performed on changes to the following assumptions: the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities; changes in lending spreads; prepayments on loans and securities; other loan and deposit balance shifts; investment, funding and hedging activities; and liquidity and capital management strategies.
simulation analysis produces only a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on judgments related to assumption inputs into the simulation model. we tailor assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled, and validate those assumptions on a regular basis. our simulations are performed with the assumption that interest rate risk positions will be actively managed through the use of on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to achieve the desired residual risk profile. however, actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition, customer behavior, product pricing, market interest rates, investment, funding and hedging activities, and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events.
figure 34 presents the results of the simulation analysis at december 31, 2015, and december 31, 2014. at december 31, 2015, our simulated exposure to changes in interest rates was moderately asset sensitive, and net interest income would benefit over time from either an increase in short-term or intermediate-term interest rates. tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual increase or decrease in short-term interest rates over the next 12 months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 4%. in december 2015, the federal reserve increased the range for the federal funds target rate, which led to an increased modeled exposure to declining interest rates. subsequent to the federal reserves action in december, we increased the magnitude of the declining rate scenario to 50 basis points, increasing our overall modeled exposure. the modeled exposure depends on the relationships of interest rates on our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, notably on instruments that are expected to react to the short end of the yield curve. as shown in figure 34, we are operating within these levels as of december 31, 2015.

the results of additional sensitivity analysis of alternate interest rate paths and loan and deposit behavior assumptions indicates that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in figure 34. net interest income is highly dependent on the timing, magnitude, frequency, and path of interest rate increases and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships, lending spreads, and the balance behavior of transaction accounts. the unprecedented low level of interest rates increases the uncertainty of assumptions for deposit balance behavior and deposit repricing relationships to market interest rates. recent balance growth in deposits has caused the uncertainty in assumptions to increase further. our historical deposit repricing betas in the last rising rate cycle ranged between 50% and 60% for interest-bearing deposits, and we continue to make similar assumptions in our modeling. the sensitivity testing of these assumptions supports our confidence that actual results are likely to be within a 100 basis point range of modeled results.
key will continue to monitor balance sheet flows and expects the benefit from rising rates to increase modestly prior to any increase in the federal funds rate. our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume, mix, maturity, and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows. as changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy, management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile.
we also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a three-year horizon. these simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a 12-month horizon. to capture longer-term exposures, we calculate exposures to changes of the eve as discussed in the following section.
economic value of equity modeling.    eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond 12-, 24-, and 36-month horizons. eve modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, measuring the resulting change in the values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, and comparing those amounts with the base case of the current interest rate environment. because the calculation of eve under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates in the current low rate environment results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points, we have modified the standard declining rate scenario to an immediate 100 basis point decrease. this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. those assumptions are based on historical behaviors, as well as our expectations. we develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our eve will decrease by more than 15% in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates. we are operating within these guidelines as of december 31, 2015.
management of interest rate exposure.    we use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate a/lm strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures. specifically, we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing
84
securities, issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates, and using derivatives  predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps, which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities.
figure 35 shows all swap positions that we hold for a/lm purposes. these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. for example, fixed-rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a receive fixed/pay variable interest rate swap. the volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader a/lm objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. for more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile, see note 8 (derivatives and hedging activities).

liquidity risk management liquidity risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by our ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund new business opportunities at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences. liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions.
governance structure we manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis. this approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity, as well as each entitys capacity to manage through adverse conditions. the approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding.
the management of consolidated liquidity risk is centralized within corporate treasury. oversight and governance is provided by the board, the erm committee, the alco, and the chief risk officer. the asset liability management policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of liquidity risk and is administered by the alco. the mrm, as the second line of defense, provides additional oversight. our current liquidity risk management practices are in compliance with the federal reserve boards enhanced prudential standards.
these committees regularly review liquidity and funding summaries, liquidity trends, peer comparisons, variance analyses, liquidity projections, hypothetical funding erosion stress tests, and goal tracking reports. the reviews generate a discussion of positions, trends, and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions. when liquidity pressure is elevated, positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive. to ensure that emerging issues are identified, we also communicate with individuals inside and outside of the company on a daily basis.
85
factors affecting liquidity our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events. an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency. examples of indirect events (events unrelated to us) that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war, natural disasters, political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund or hedge fund. similarly, market speculation, or rumors about us or the banking industry in general, may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources.
following our announced acquisition of first niagara in october 2015, s&p and fitch affirmed keys ratings but changed the outlook to negative. moodys placed keys ratings under review for downgrade. the moodys review could be outstanding beyond the targeted merger completion date.
our credit ratings at december 31, 2015, are shown in figure 36. we believe these credit ratings, under normal conditions in the capital markets, will enable keycorp or keybank to issue fixed income securities to investors.

we regularly monitor our liquidity position and funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of hypothetical scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding. in the normal course of business, we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both keycorp and keybank. in a heightened monitoring mode, we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently, and use assumptions to reflect the changed market environment. our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies. erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods. ultimately, they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations. to compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed.
we maintain a contingency funding plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis. the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions. it also assigns specific roles and
86
responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period. as part of the plan, we maintain on-balance sheet liquid reserves referred to as our liquid asset portfolio, which consists of high quality liquid assets. during a problem period, that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longer-term strategy. the liquid asset portfolio at december 31, 2015, totaled $15.4 billion, consisting of $12.9 billion of unpledged securities, $584 million of securities available for secured funding at the fhlb, and $1.9 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our federal reserve account. the liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate due to excess liquidity, heightened risk, or prefunding of expected outflows, such as debt maturities. additionally, as of december 31, 2015, our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was $18.9 billion at the federal reserve bank of cleveland and $3.0 billion at the fhlb. in 2015, keys outstanding fhlb advances were reduced by $33 million due to repayments.
final u.s. liquidity coverage ratio under the liquidity coverage rules, we will be required to calculate the modified lcr for key. implementation for modified lcr banking organizations, like key, began on january 1, 2016, with a minimum requirement of 90% coverage, reaching 100% coverage by january 1, 2017. at december 31, 2015, our estimated modified lcr was above 100%. in the future, we may change the composition of our investment portfolio, increase the size of the overall investment portfolio, and modify product offerings to enhance or optimize our liquidity position.
additional information about the liquidity coverage ratio is included in the supervision and regulation section under the heading u.s. implementation of the basel iii liquidity framework in item 1 of this report.
long-term liquidity strategy our long-term liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits. however, we may use wholesale funds to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands, and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives. keys client-based relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base that, in conjunction with intermediate and long-term wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base, supports our liquidity risk management strategy. we use the loan-to-deposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies. our target loan-to-deposit ratio is 90-100% (at december 31, 2015, our loan-to-deposit ratio was 88%), which we calculate as total loans, loans held for sale, and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by domestic deposits.
sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity include customer deposits, wholesale funding, and liquid assets. if the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances, we rely on wholesale funding or on-balance sheet liquid reserves. conversely, excess cash generated by operating, investing, and deposit-gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets.
liquidity programs we have several liquidity programs, which are described in note 18 (long-term debt), that are designed to enable keycorp and keybank to raise funds in the public and private debt markets. the proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. these liquidity programs are reviewed from time to time by the board and are renewed and replaced as necessary. there are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs.
on february 12, 2015, keybank issued $1 billion of 2.250% senior bank notes due march 16, 2020, under its global bank note program. on june 1, 2015, under its global bank note program, keybank issued $1.75 billion of senior bank notes in three tranches; $250 million of floating rate notes due june 1, 2018; $750
87
million of 1.700% senior notes due june 1, 2018; and $750 million of 3.300% senior notes due june 1, 2025. on september 29, 2015, we updated the keybank global bank note program. this program has $20 billion authorized for issuance, separate from the $20 billion authorized under the 2012 program. there will be no additional notes issued under the 2012 program.
on may 22, 2015, keybank remarketed $300 million of 3.18% term enhanced remarketable securities senior debt.
on september 15, 2015, keycorp issued $1 billion of 2.90% senior medium-term notes due september 15, 2020, under its medium-term note program.
liquidity for keycorp the primary source of liquidity for keycorp is from subsidiary dividends, primarily from keybank. keycorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt; support customary corporate operations and activities (including acquisitions); support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences; and pay dividends to shareholders.
we use a parent cash coverage months metric as the primary measure to assess parent company liquidity. the parent cash coverage months metric measures the months into the future where projected obligations can be met with the current amount of liquidity. we generally issue term debt to supplement dividends from keybank to manage our liquidity position at or above our targeted levels. the parent company generally maintains cash and short-term investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over at least the next 24 months. at december 31, 2015, keycorp held $2.7 billion in short-term investments, which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations, including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance.
typically, keycorp meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from keybank, supplemented with term debt. federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. a national banks dividend-paying capacity is affected by several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the two previous calendar years and for the current year, up to the date of dividend declaration. during 2015, keybank paid $1 billion in dividends to keycorp. at january 1, 2016, keybank had regulatory capacity to pay $553 million in dividends to keycorp without prior regulatory approval.
our liquidity position and recent activity over the past 12 months, our liquid asset portfolio, which includes overnight and short-term investments, as well as unencumbered, high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios, has increased as a result of an increase in unpledged securities offset by net customer loan and deposit flows. the liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longer-term solution.
from time to time, keycorp or keybank may seek to retire, repurchase, or exchange outstanding debt, capital securities, preferred shares, or common shares through cash purchase, privately negotiated transactions or other means. additional information on repurchases of common shares by keycorp is included in part ii, item 5. market for the registrants common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities of this report. such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and capital requirements, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements, and other factors. the amounts involved may be material, individually or collectively.
88
we generate cash flows from operations and from investing and financing activities. we have approximately $185 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in international tax jurisdictions as of december 31, 2015. as we consider alternative long-term strategic and liquidity plans, opportunities to repatriate these amounts would result in approximately $2 million in taxes to be paid. we have included the appropriate amount as a deferred tax liability at december 31, 2015.
the consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended december 31, 2015, and december 31, 2014.
credit risk management credit risk is the risk of loss to us arising from an obligors inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. like other financial services institutions, we make loans, extend credit, purchase securities, and enter into financial derivative contracts, all of which have related credit risk.
credit policy, approval, and evaluation we manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program. the credit risk committee approves both retail and commercial credit policies. these policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit.
our credit risk management team is responsible for credit approval, is independent of our lines of business, and consists of senior officers who have extensive experience in structuring and approving loans. only credit risk management members are authorized to grant significant exceptions to credit policies. it is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate, but most major lending units have been assigned specific thresholds to keep exceptions at an acceptable level based upon portfolio and economic considerations.
loan grades are assigned at the time of origination, verified by the credit risk management team and periodically reevaluated thereafter. most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring. this risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling. commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings. the first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation; the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility. default probability is determined based on, among other factors, the financial strength of the borrower, an assessment of the borrowers management, the borrowers competitive position within its industry sector, and our view of industry risk within the context of the general economic outlook. types of exposure, transaction structure and collateral, including credit risk mitigants, affect the expected recovery assessment.
our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans. these models, known as scorecards, forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant. the scorecards are embedded in the application processing system, which allows for real-time scoring and automated decisions for many of our products. we periodically validate the loan grading and scoring processes.
we maintain an active concentration management program to mitigate concentration risk in our credit portfolios. for individual obligors, we employ a sliding scale of exposure, known as hold limits, which is dictated by the type of loan and strength of the borrower. our legal lending limit is approximately $1.6 billion for any individual borrower. however, internal hold limits generally restrict the largest exposures to less than 20% of that amount. as of december 31, 2015, we had five client relationships with loan commitments net of credit default swaps of more than $200 million. the average amount outstanding on these five individual net obligor commitments was $45 million at december 31, 2015. in general, our philosophy is to maintain a diverse portfolio with regard to credit exposures.
89
we actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives and concentration risk tolerances to mitigate portfolio credit risk. we utilize credit default swaps on a limited basis to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party. at december 31, 2015, we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of $346 million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations. we may also sell credit derivatives  primarily single name credit default swaps  to offset our purchased credit default swap position prior to maturity. at december 31, 2015, we did not have any sold credit default swaps outstanding.
credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. related gains or losses, as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection, are included in the corporate services income and other income components of noninterest income.
allowance for loan and lease losses at december 31, 2015, the alll was $796 million, or 1.33% of period-end loans, compared to $794 million, or 1.38%, at december 31, 2014. the allowance includes $35 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of $308 million at december 31, 2015, compared to $40 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of $302 million at december 31, 2014. for more information about impaired loans, see note 5 (asset quality). at december 31, 2015, the alll was 205.7% of nonperforming loans, compared to 190.0% at december 31, 2014.

we estimate the appropriate level of the alll on at least a quarterly basis. the methodology used is described in note 1 (summary of significant accounting policies) under the heading allowance for loan and lease losses. briefly, our allowance applies expected loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics. we exercise judgment to assess any adjustment to the expected loss rates for the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions, lending policies including underwriting standards, and the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets.
in the third quarter of 2015, we enhanced the approach used to determine the commercial reserve factors used in estimating the quantitative component of the commercial alll. in addition, we began utilizing an enhanced framework to quantify commercial alll adjustments resulting from qualitative factors not fully captured within the statistical analysis of incurred loss. the enhancements of the methodology are described in note 1 (basis of
90
presentation and accounting policies) under the heading allowance for loan and lease losses. as a result of the methodology enhancements, the alll within each commercial portfolio and the provision for credit losses within each business segment has increased or decreased accordingly. the impact of the increases or decreases on the commercial portfolio alll and the business segment provision for credit losses was not significant.
for all commercial and consumer loan tdrs, regardless of size, as well as impaired commercial loans with an outstanding balance of $2.5 million or greater, we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate. we estimate the extent of the individual impairment for commercial loans and tdrs by comparing the recorded investment of the loan with the estimated present value of its future cash flows, the fair value of its underlying collateral, or the loans observable market price. secured consumer loan tdrs that are discharged through chapter 7 bankruptcy and not formally re-affirmed are adjusted to reflect the fair value of the underlying collateral, less costs to sell. other consumer loan tdrs are combined in homogenous pools and assigned a specific allocation based on the estimated present value of future cash flows using the effective interest rate. a specific allowance also may be assigned  even when sources of repayment appear sufficient  if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full. on at least a quarterly basis, we evaluate the appropriateness of our loss estimation methods to reduce differences between estimated incurred losses and actual losses. the alll at december 31, 2015, represents our best estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date.
as shown in figure 38, our alll from continuing operations remained relatively stable, increasing by $2 million, or .3%, since 2014. our allowance applies expected loss rates to our existing loans with similar risk characteristics as well as any adjustments to reflect our current assessment of qualitative factors, such as changes in economic conditions, underwriting standards, and concentrations of credit. our commercial alll increased by $33 million, or 5.3%, since 2014 primarily because of loan growth and increased incurred loss estimates. the increase in these incurred loss estimates during 2015 was primarily due to the continued decline in oil and gas prices since 2014. partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in our consumer alll of $31 million, or 18.1%, since 2014. our consumer alll decrease was primarily due to continued improvement in credit metrics, such as delinquency, average credit bureau score, and loan to value, which have decreased expected loss rates since 2014. the continued improvement in the consumer portfolio credit quality metrics since 2014 was primarily due to continued improved credit quality and benefits of relatively stable economic conditions. our liability for credit losses on lending-related commitments increased by $21 million to $56 million at december 31, 2015. when combined with our alll, our total allowance for credit losses represented 1.42% of period-end loans at december 31, 2015, compared to 1.44% at december 31, 2014.

(a)   excludes allocations of the alll related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business in the amount of $28 million at december 31, 2015, $29 million at december 31, 2014, $39 million at december 31, 2013, $55 million at december 31, 2012, and $104 million at december 31, 2011.

our provision for credit losses was $166 million for 2015, compared to $57 million for 2014. the increase in our provision is due to the growth in our loan portfolio over the past twelve months as well as lower recoveries in 2015 compared to 2014. we continue to reduce our exposure in our higher-risk businesses, including the residential properties portion of our construction loan portfolio, marine/rv financing, and other selected leasing portfolios through the sale of certain loans, payments from borrowers, or net loan charge-offs.
asset quality on our oil and gas loan portfolio, which represents approximately 2% of total loans at december 31, 2015, performed in-line with our expectations in 2015. nonperforming loans in this sector increased to .54% of our total oil and gas loan portfolio at december 31, 2015, up from .09% at december 31, 2014. in 2015, net loan charge-offs in this sector were .81% of our total oil and gas loan portfolio as a result of commodity price declines that began in 2014. our reserve for credit losses allocated to our oil and gas loan exposure was 6% of the total oil and gas loan portfolio at december 31, 2015, and reflected the estimated impact of current oil prices at that date.

net loan charge-offs net loan charge-offs for 2015 totaled $142 million, or .24% of average loans, compared to net loan charge-offs of $113 million, or .20%, for the same period last year. figure 39 shows the trend in our net loan charge-offs by loan type, while the composition of loan charge-offs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in figure 40.
over the past 12 months, net loan charge-offs increased $29 million. this increase is attributable to the growth in our loan portfolio and lower levels of recoveries over the same period. as shown in figure 42, our exit loan portfolio contributed a total of $10 million in net loan charge-offs for 2015, compared to $13 million in net loan charge-offs for 2014. the decrease in net loan charge-offs in our exit loan portfolio was primarily driven by lower levels of net loan charge-offs in our consumer and commercial exit loan portfolios.

as shown in figure 41, nonperforming assets decreased during 2015, having declined for the past five years. most of the reduction came from nonperforming loans in our consumer loan portfolio. as shown in figure 42, our exit loan portfolio accounted for $23 million, or 6%, of total nonperforming assets at december 31, 2015, compared to $41 million, or 9%, at december 31, 2014.
at december 31, 2015, the approximate carrying amount of our commercial nonperforming loans outstanding represented 66% of their original contractual amount, total nonperforming loans outstanding represented 79% of their contractual amount, and total nonperforming assets represented 79% of their original contractual amount. at the same date, oreo represented 72% of its original contractual amount.
at december 31, 2015, our 20 largest nonperforming loans totaled $97 million, representing 25% of total loans on nonperforming status from continuing operations, compared to $88 million, representing 21% in the prior year.
figure 42 shows the composition of our exit loan portfolio at december 31, 2015, and 2014, the net loan charge-offs recorded on this portfolio, and the nonperforming status of those loans at these dates. the exit loan portfolio represented 3% of total loans and loans held for sale at december 31, 2015, compared to 4% at december 31, 2014. additional information about loan sales is included in the loans and loans held for sale section under loan sales.

operational and compliance risk management like all businesses, we are subject to operational risk, which is the risk of loss resulting from human error or malfeasance, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. these events include, among other things, threats to our cybersecurity, as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities.
operational risk also encompasses compliance risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules and regulations, prescribed practices, and ethical standards. under the dodd-frank act, large financial companies like key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation. this heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk. we have created work teams to respond to and analyze the regulatory requirements that have been or will be promulgated as a result of the enactment of the dodd-frank act. resulting operational risk losses and/or additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation, or foregone opportunities.
we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk, alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance, and a system of internal controls and reporting. we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws, rules, and regulations. for example, an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses. this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action. we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes. this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board.
the operational risk management program provides the framework for the structure, governance, roles, and responsibilities, as well as the content, to manage operational risk for key. the compliance risk committee serves the same function in managing compliance risk for key. primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business. the operational risk committee and compliance risk committee are senior management committees that oversee our level of operational and compliance risk and direct and support our operational and compliance infrastructure and related activities. these committees and the operational risk management and compliance functions are an integral part of our erm program. our risk review function regularly assesses the overall effectiveness of our operational risk management and compliance programs and our system of internal controls. risk review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the risk and audit committees and independently supports the risk committees oversight of these controls.

cybersecurity we maintain comprehensive cyber incident response plans, and we devote significant time and resources to maintaining and regularly updating our technology systems and processes to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks, and other technology assets against attempts by third parties to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems, or cause other damage. we and many other u.s. financial institutions have experienced distributed denial-of-service attacks from technologically sophisticated third parties. these attacks are intended to disrupt or disable consumer online banking services and prevent banking transactions. we also periodically experience other attempts to breach the security of our systems and data. these cyberattacks have not, to date, resulted in any material disruption of our operations or material harm to our customers, and have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
cyberattack risks may also occur with our third-party technology service providers, and may interfere with their ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, with attendant potential for financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. recent high-profile cyberattacks have targeted retailers and other businesses for the purpose of acquiring the confidential information (including personal, financial, and credit card information) of customers, some of whom are customers of ours. we may incur expenses related to the investigation of such attacks or related to the protection of our customers from identity theft as a result of such attacks. risks and exposures related to cyberattacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking, mobile banking, and other technology-based products and services by us and our clients.
fourth quarter results figure 45 shows our financial performance for each of the past eight quarters. highlights of our results for the fourth quarter of 2015 are summarized below.
earnings our fourth quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders was $224 million, or $.27 per common share, compared to $246 million, or $.28 per common share, for the fourth quarter of 2014.
on an annualized basis, our return on average total assets from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2015 was .97%, compared to 1.12% for the fourth quarter of 2014. the annualized return on average common equity from continuing operations was 8.51% for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to 9.50% for the year-ago quarter.
net interest income our taxable-equivalent net interest income was $610 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, and the net interest margin was 2.87%. these results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $588 million and a net interest margin of 2.94% for the fourth quarter of 2014. the $22 million increase in net interest margin reflects higher earning asset balances, partially offset by lower earning asset yields, which also drove the decline in net interest margin.
noninterest income our noninterest income was $485 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $490 million for the year-ago quarter. the slight decrease from the prior year was predominantly attributable to a decline in net gains from

principal investing of $18 million and $7 million of lower trust and investment services income reflecting market variability. these decreases were partially offset by a $12 million increase in other income and growth in some of our other core fee-based businesses, including $4 million of higher cards and payments income due to higher credit card and merchant fees due to increased volume and a $4 million increase in mortgage servicing fees.
noninterest expense our noninterest expense was $736 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. during the quarter, we incurred merger-related costs of $6 million, a pension settlement charge of $4 million, and costs associated with continuous improvement and efficiency efforts of $10 million. these costs impacted both personnel and nonpersonnel expense.
compared to $704 million for the fourth quarter of last year, the increase in noninterest expense was primarily attributable to a $20 million increase in personnel expense related to investments made across the business, along with an increase in employee benefits expense. nonpersonnel expense increased $12 million, most notably from higher business services and professional fees, partially due to merger-related costs.
provision for credit losses our provision for credit losses was $45 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $22 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. our alll was $796 million, or 1.33% of total period-end loans, at december 31, 2015, compared to $794 million, or 1.38%, at december 31, 2014.
net loan charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2015 totaled $37 million, or .25% of average loans, compared to $32 million, or .22%, for the same period last year.
income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of $73 million, compared to a tax provision of $94 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 23.9%, compared to 27.2% for the same quarter one year ago, due to additional federal tax credit refunds filed for prior years.

critical accounting policies and estimates our business is dynamic and complex. consequently, we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies. these choices are critical; not only are they necessary to comply with gaap, they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance. all accounting policies are important, and all policies described in note 1 (summary of significant accounting policies) should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance.
in our opinion, some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility. these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance, or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances, they may prove to be inaccurate, or we may find it necessary to change them.
as described below, we rely heavily on the use of judgment, assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions. we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee.
allowance for loan and lease losses the loan portfolio is the largest category of assets on our balance sheet. we consider a variety of data to determine probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio and to establish an allowance that is sufficient to absorb those losses. for example, we apply expected loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions, underwriting standards, and concentrations of credit. other considerations include expected cash flows and estimated collateral values.
for all commercial and consumer tdrs, regardless of size, as well as all other impaired commercial loans with an outstanding balances of $2.5 million or greater, we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate. for example, a specific allowance may be assigned  even when sources of repayment appear sufficient  if we remain uncertain that an impaired loan will be repaid in full.
we continually assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio and adjust the alll when appropriate. the economic and business climate in any given industry or market is difficult to gauge and can change rapidly, and the effects of those changes can vary by borrower. however, since our total loan portfolio is well diversified in many respects, and the risk profile of certain segments of the loan portfolio may be improving while the risk profile of
103
others is deteriorating, we may decide to change the level of the allowance for one segment of the portfolio without changing it for any other segment.
in addition to adjusting the alll to reflect market conditions, we also may adjust the allowance because of unique events that are likely to cause actual losses to vary abruptly and significantly from expected losses. for example, class action lawsuits brought against an industry segment (e.g., one that used asbestos in its product) can cause a precipitous deterioration in the risk profile of borrowers doing business in that segment. conversely, the dismissal of such lawsuits can improve the risk profile. in either case, historical loss rates for that industry segment would not have provided a precise basis for determining the appropriate level of allowance.
even minor changes in the level of estimated losses can significantly affect managements determination of the appropriate allowance because those changes must be applied across a large portfolio. to illustrate, an increase in estimated losses equal to one-tenth of one percent of our consumer loan portfolio as of december 31, 2015, would indicate the need for a $16 million increase in the allowance. the same increase in estimated losses for the commercial loan portfolio would result in a $44 million increase in the allowance. such adjustments to the alll can materially affect financial results. following the above examples, a $16 million increase in the consumer loan portfolio allowance would have reduced our earnings on an after-tax basis by approximately $10 million, or $.01 per common share; a $44 million increase in the commercial loan portfolio allowance would have reduced earnings on an after-tax basis by approximately $28 million, or $.03 per common share.
as we make decisions regarding the allowance, we benefit from a lengthy organizational history and experience with credit evaluations and related outcomes. nonetheless, if our underlying assumptions later prove to be inaccurate, the alll would likely need to be adjusted, possibly having an adverse effect on our results of operations.
in the third quarter of 2015, we enhanced the approach used to determine the commercial reserve factors used in estimating the commercial alll, which had the effect of capturing certain elements in the commercial quantitative reserve component that had formerly been included in the commercial qualitative component. under the enhanced methodology, we began utilizing more refined commercial estimated loss rates that represent cumulative losses over the estimated average time period from the onset of credit deterioration loss to the initial loss recorded for an individual loan. in addition, we began utilizing an enhanced framework to quantify commercial alll adjustments resulting from qualitative factors that may not be fully captured within the statistical analysis of incurred loss. the enhanced framework utilizes the nine qualitative factors recommended within the occs interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses (issued 12/13/2006) to quantify the commercial qualitative component. the impact of these changes was largely neutral to the total alll. however, because the quantitative reserve is allocated to the business segments at a loan level, while the qualitative portion is allocated at the portfolio level, the impact of the methodology enhancements on the allowance for each business segment and each portfolio caused the business segment and commercial portfolio reserves to increase or decrease accordingly. the impact of the increases and decreases on the business segment and commercial portfolio reserves was not significant.
our accounting policy related to the allowance is disclosed in note 1 under the heading allowance for loan and lease losses.
valuation methodologies we follow the applicable accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. in the absence of quoted market prices, we determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities using internally developed models, which are based on third-party data as well as our judgment, assumptions and estimates regarding credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and other relevant market available inputs. we describe our
104
application of this accounting guidance, the process used to determine fair values, and the fair value hierarchy in note 1 under the heading fair value measurements, and in note 6 (fair value measurements).
valuation methodologies often involve significant judgment, particularly when there are no observable active markets for the items being valued. to determine the values of assets and liabilities, as well as the extent to which related assets may be impaired, we make assumptions and estimates related to discount rates, asset returns, prepayment rates and other factors. the use of different discount rates or other valuation assumptions could produce significantly different results. the outcomes of valuations that we perform have a direct bearing on the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities, including loans held for sale, principal investments, goodwill, and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.
at december 31, 2015, $15.9 billion, or 17%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. substantially all of these assets were classified as level 1 or level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. at december 31, 2015, $1.2 billion, or 1%, of our total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. substantially all of these liabilities were classified as level 1 or level 2.
at december 31, 2015, $7 million, or less than 1%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. all of these assets were classified as level 3. at december 31, 2015, there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
a discussion of the valuation methodology applied to our loans held for sale is included in note 1 under the heading loans held for sale.
our principal investments include direct and indirect investments, predominantly in privately-held companies. the fair values of these investments are determined by considering a number of factors, including the target companys financial condition and results of operations, values of public companies in comparable businesses, market liquidity, and the nature and duration of resale restrictions. the fair value of principal investments was $304 million at december 31, 2015. a 10% positive or negative variance in that fair value would have increased or decreased our 2015 earnings by approximately $30 million ($19 million after tax, or $.02 per common share).
the valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in note 1 under the heading goodwill and other intangible assets. accounting guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether additional goodwill impairment testing is required. we did not choose to utilize this qualitative assessment in our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2015. therefore, the first step in testing for impairment is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. our reporting units for purposes of this testing are our two major business segments: key community bank and key corporate bank. fair values are estimated using comparable external market data (market approach) and discounted cash flow modeling that incorporates an appropriate risk premium and earnings forecast information (income approach). we believe the estimates and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment analysis for our reporting units are reasonable. however, if actual results and market conditions differ from the assumptions or estimates used, the fair value of each reporting unit could change in the future.
the second step of impairment testing is necessary only if the carrying amount of either reporting unit exceeds its fair value, suggesting goodwill impairment. in such a case, we would estimate a hypothetical purchase price for the reporting unit (representing the units fair value) and then compare that hypothetical purchase price with the fair value of the units net assets (excluding goodwill). any excess of the estimated purchase price over the fair value of the reporting units net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill. an impairment loss would be recognized as a charge to earnings if the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. we continue to monitor the impairment indicators for goodwill and other intangible assets, and to evaluate the carrying amount of these assets quarterly. the acquisition of pacific crest securities during the third quarter of 2014 resulted in a $78 million increase in the goodwill recorded in the key corporate bank unit. approximately $72 million of the goodwill was allocated to kbcm in the second quarter of 2015,
105
when pacific crest securities was fully merged into kbcm. during the third quarter of 2015, goodwill increased $3 million to account for a tax item associated with the business combination. additional information is provided in note 10 (goodwill and other intangible assets).
the primary assumptions used in determining our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related expenses, including sensitivity analysis of these assumptions, are presented in note 16 (employee benefits).
when potential asset impairment is identified, we must exercise judgment to determine the nature of the potential impairment (i.e., temporary or other-than-temporary) to apply the appropriate accounting treatment. for example, unrealized losses on securities available for sale that are deemed temporary are recorded in shareholders equity; those deemed other-than-temporary are recorded in either earnings or shareholders equity based on certain factors. additional information regarding temporary and other-than-temporary impairment on securities available for sale at december 31, 2015, is provided in note 7 (securities).
derivatives and hedging we primarily use interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes. these derivative instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of specified on-balance sheet assets and liabilities. our accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current accounting guidance, which provides that all derivatives should be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value, after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements. accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a particular derivative depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship, and further, on the type of hedging relationship.
the application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance, as well as to assess hedge effectiveness, identify similar hedged item groupings, and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items. we believe our methods of addressing these judgments and applying the accounting guidance are consistent with both the guidance and industry practices. however, interpretations of the applicable accounting guidance continue to change and evolve. in the future, these evolving interpretations could result in material changes to our accounting for derivative financial instruments and related hedging activities. although such changes may not have a material effect on our financial condition, a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which it occurs. additional information relating to our use of derivatives is included in note 1 under the heading derivatives, and note 8 (derivatives and hedging activities).
contingent liabilities, guarantees and income taxes note 20 (commitments, contingent liabilities and guarantees) summarizes contingent liabilities arising from litigation and contingent liabilities arising from guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which we are a guarantor, and the potential effects of these items on the results of our operations. we record a liability for the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a guarantee, but there is a risk that our actual future payments in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed the recorded amount. see note 20 for a comparison of the liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for the various types of guarantees that we had outstanding at december 31, 2015.
it is not always clear how the internal revenue code and various state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake. in the normal course of business, we may record tax benefits and then have those benefits contested by the irs or state tax authorities. we have provided tax reserves that we believe are adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges may necessitate. however, if our judgment later proves to be inaccurate, the tax reserves may need to be adjusted, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital.

additionally, we conduct quarterly assessments that determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are more-likely-than-not to be realized, and therefore recorded. the available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes taxable income in prior periods, projected future taxable income, potential tax-planning strategies, and projected future reversals of deferred tax items. these assessments are subjective and may change. based on these criteria, and in particular our projections for future taxable income, we currently believe it is more-likely-than-not that we will realize our net deferred tax asset in future periods. however, if our assessments prove incorrect, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which they occur. for further information on our accounting for income taxes, see note 12 (income taxes).
during 2015, we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates except for the alll enhanced methodology discussed above.

(a)   represents our outstanding leases.

(b)   represents contracts to hedge our balance sheet asset and liability needs, and to accommodate our clients trading and/or hedging needs. our derivative mark-to-market exposures are calculated and reported on a daily basis. these exposures are largely covered by cash or highly marketable securities collateral with daily collateral calls.

(c)   other europe consists of the following countries: austria, belarus, belgium, bulgaria, cyprus, czech republic, denmark, finland, hungary, lithuania, luxembourg, malta, norway, poland, romania, russia, slovakia, slovenia, sweden, and ukraine. 100% of our exposure in other europe is in belgium, finland, and sweden.

our credit risk exposure is largely concentrated in developed countries with emerging market exposure essentially limited to commercial facilities; these exposures are actively monitored by management. we do not have at-risk exposures in the rest of the world.

item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with "cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements" and our combined consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k.
operating results factors affecting operating results bunge limited, a bermuda company, together with its subsidiaries, is a leading global agribusiness and food company operating in the farm-to-consumer food chain. the commodity nature of the company's principal products, as well as regional and global supply and demand variations that occur as an inherent part of the business make volumes an important operating measure. accordingly, information is included in "segment results" that summarizes certain items in our consolidated statements of income and volumes by reportable segment. the common unit of measure for all reported volumes is metric tons. a description of reported volumes for each reportable segment has also been included in the discussion of key factors affecting results of operations in each of our business segments as discussed below.
32
agribusiness in the agribusiness segment, we purchase, store, transport, process and sell agricultural commodities and commodity products. profitability in this segment is affected by the availability and market prices of agricultural commodities and processed commodity products and the availability and costs of energy, transportation and logistics services. profitability in our oilseed processing operations is also impacted by volumes procured, processed and sold and by capacity utilization rates. availability of agricultural commodities is affected by many factors, including weather, farmer planting decisions, plant diseases, governmental policies and agricultural sector economic conditions. reported volumes in this segment primarily reflect (i) grains and oilseeds originated from farmers, cooperatives or other aggregators and from which "origination margins" are earned; (ii) oilseeds processed in our oilseed processing facilities and from which "crushing margins" are earnedrepresenting the margin resulting from the industrial separation of the oilseed into its protein meal and vegetable oil components, both of which components are separate commodity products themselves; and (iii) third party sales of grains, oilseeds and related commodity products merchandised through our distribution businesses and from which "distribution margins" are earned. the foregoing sub-segment volumes may overlap as they produce separate margin capture opportunities. for example, oilseeds procured in our south american grain origination activities may be processed in our oilseed processing facilities in asia-pacific and will be reflected at both points within the segment. as such, these reported volumes do not represent solely volumes of net sales to third-parties, but rather where margin is earned, appropriately reflecting their contribution to our global network's capacity utilization and profitability.
demand for our purchased and processed agribusiness products is affected by many factors, including global and regional economic conditions, changes in per capita incomes, the financial condition of customers and customer access to credit, worldwide consumption of food products, particularly pork and poultry, population growth rates, relative prices of substitute agricultural products, outbreaks of disease associated with livestock and poultry, and demand for renewable fuels produced from agricultural commodities and commodity products.
we expect that the factors described above will continue to affect global supply and demand for our agribusiness products for the foreseeable future. we also expect that, from time to time, imbalances will likely exist between oilseed processing capacity and demand for oilseed products in certain regions, which impacts our decisions regarding whether, when and where to purchase, store, transport, process or sell these commodities, including whether to change the location of or adjust our own oilseed processing capacity.
additionally, price fluctuations and availability of commodities may cause fluctuations in our working capital, such as inventories, accounts receivable and borrowings over the course of a given year. for example, increased availability of commodities at harvest times often causes fluctuations in our inventories and borrowings. increases in agricultural commodity prices will also generally cause our cash flow requirements to increase as our operations require increased use of cash to acquire inventories and fund daily settlement requirements on exchange traded futures that we use to hedge our physical inventories.
food and ingredients in the food and ingredients business, which consists of our edible oil products and milling products segments, our operating results are affected by changes in the prices of raw materials, such as crude vegetable oils and grains, the mix of products that we sell, changes in consumer eating habits, changes in per capita incomes, consumer purchasing power levels, availability of credit to customers, governmental dietary guidelines and policies, changes in regional economic conditions and the general competitive environment in our markets. raw material inputs to our production processes in the edible oil products segment and the milling products segment are largely sourced at market prices from our
33
agribusiness segment. reported volumes in these segments reflect third-party sales of our finished products and, as such, include the sales of products derived from raw materials sourced from the agribusiness segment as well as from third-parties. the unit of measure for these volumes is metric tons as these businesses are linked to the commodity raw materials which are their primary inputs.
sugar and bioenergy our sugar and bioenergy segment is an integrated business which includes the procurement and growing of sugarcane and the production of sugar, ethanol and electricity in our eight mills in brazil, global sugar trading and merchandising activities and investment interests in affiliates.
profitability in this segment is affected by the availability and quality of sugarcane, which impacts our capacity utilization rates and the amount of sugar that can be extracted from the sugarcane, and by market prices of sugarcane, sugar and ethanol. availability and quality of sugarcane is affected by many factors, including weather, geographical factors such as soil quality and topography, and agricultural practices. once planted, sugarcane may be harvested for several continuous years, but the yield decreases with each subsequent harvest. as a result, the current optimum economic cycle is generally five or six consecutive harvests, depending on location. we own and/or have partnership agreements to manage farmland on which we grow and harvest sugarcane. we also purchase sugarcane from third parties. prices of sugarcane in brazil are established by consecana, the são paulo state sugarcane, sugar and ethanol council, and are based on the sucrose content of the cane and the market prices of sugar and ethanol. demand for our products is affected by such factors as changes in global or regional economic conditions, the financial condition of customers and customer access to credit, worldwide consumption of food products, population growth rates, changes in per capita incomes and demand for and governmental support of renewable fuels produced from agricultural commodities, including sugarcane. we expect that these factors will continue to affect supply and demand for our sugar and bioenergy products in the foreseeable future. reported volumes in this segment reflect third-party sales of sugar and ethanol.
fertilizer in the fertilizer segment, demand for our products is affected by the profitability of the agricultural sectors we serve, the availability of credit to farmers, agricultural commodity prices, the types of crops planted, the number of acres planted, the quality of the land under cultivation and weather-related issues affecting the success of the harvests. our profitability is impacted by international selling prices for fertilizers and fertilizer raw materials, such as phosphate, sulfur, ammonia and urea, ocean freight rates and other import costs, as well as import volumes at the port facilities we manage. as our operations are in south america, primarily argentina, our results in this segment are typically seasonal, with fertilizer sales normally concentrated in the third and fourth quarters of the year due to the timing of the south american agricultural cycle. reported volumes in this segment reflect third-party sales of our finished products.
in addition to these industry related factors which impact our business areas, our results of operations in all business areas and segments are affected by the following factors:
foreign currency exchange rates due to the global nature of our operations, our operating results can be materially impacted by foreign currency exchange rates. both translation of our foreign subsidiaries' financial statements and foreign currency transactions can affect our results. on a monthly basis, for subsidiaries whose functional currency is their local currency, subsidiary statements of income and cash flows must be translated into u.s. dollars for consolidation purposes based on weighted-average exchange rates in each monthly period. as a result, fluctuations of local currencies compared to the u.s. dollar during
34
each monthly period impact our consolidated statements of income and cash flows for each reported period (quarter and year-to-date) and also affect comparisons between those reported periods. subsidiary balance sheets are translated using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date with the resulting translation adjustments reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). included in accumulated other comprehensive income for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were foreign exchange net translation gains (losses) of $(2,546) million, $(1,411) million, and $(1,221) million, respectively, resulting from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities.
additionally, we record transaction gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity. these amounts are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates as of the balance sheet date, with the resulting gains or losses included in the entity's statement of income and, therefore, in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange gains (losses).
we primarily use a combination of equity and intercompany loans to finance our subsidiaries. intercompany loans that are of a long-term investment nature with no intention of repayment in the foreseeable future are considered permanently invested and as such are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes. as a result, any foreign exchange translation gains or losses on such permanently invested intercompany loans are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets. in contrast, foreign exchange translation gains or losses on intercompany loans that are not of a permanent nature are recorded in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange gains (losses).
income taxes as a bermuda exempted company, we are not subject to income taxes on income in our jurisdiction of incorporation. however, our subsidiaries, which operate in multiple tax jurisdictions, are subject to income taxes at various statutory rates ranging from 0% to 39%. the jurisdictions that significantly impact our effective tax rate are brazil, the united states, argentina and bermuda. determination of taxable income requires the interpretation of related and often complex tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction where we operate and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future events.
results of operations
2015 overview total segment ebit of $1,248 million in 2015 increased from $956 million in 2014. ebit for 2015 includes a $47 million gain on the sale of certain grain assets in canada to g3 canada limited (formerly the canadian wheat board) and a $30 million reversal of an export tax contingency in argentina, partially offset by a $13 million goodwill impairment charge in our brazilian tomato products business, impairment charges in our equity method investment in a freight shipping company of $14 million and $15 million as a result of the announced closure of a packaged oil plant in the united states, as well as a $9 million charge for administrative tax assessment fees related to export activities in our argentine subsidiary. ebit for 2014 included a charge of $149 million resulting from impairment and restructuring charges, primarily in our sugar and bioenergy segment and were also impacted by an expense of $112 million resulting from a judicial precedent in brazil that certain state icms tax credits related to staple foods, including soy oil, margarine, mayonnaise and wheat flours are unconstitutional.
agribusiness segment ebit of $1,108 million for 2015 was $218 million higher compared to $890 million in 2014. the primary drivers of the increase included a record year for global soy crush driven by strong demand and residual supply tightness largely due to lack of argentine farmer selling
35
of soybeans throughout most of the year. during the year, soybean processing results in asia-pacific improved, and we experienced record oilseed processing and grain origination results in brazil where we benefitted throughout the year from good farmer selling driven by the depreciating brazilian real relative to the u.s. dollar. 2015 saw improvements in ocean freight and in our ports and services operations. u.s. operations benefitted from very strong soybean processing results, driven by good margins and volumes. however, this was partially offset by lower results in canadian softseed processing, which was impacted by lower margins from slow farmer selling, and lower results in u.s. grain origination, which was impacted by the stronger u.s. dollar which made u. s. exports less competitive to other geographies. in europe, our agribusiness operations benefitted from the favorable soybean processing environment, as discussed above; however, our softseed processing operations, particularly rapeseed, had a challenging year.
edible oil products segment ebit was $59 million in 2015 compared to $58 million in 2014. ebit for 2015 included a charge of $15 million for the announced closure of a packaged oil plant in the united states and a $13 million goodwill impairment charge in our brazilian tomato products business. ebit for 2014 included an expense of $98 million related to certain icms tax credits in brazil. excluding the effects of these items, results were lower by $69 million. the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against most major currencies where we operate in this segment had a negative impact on both margins and volumes in 2015. in brazil, results in packaged oils and margarines declined driven by a recessionary economy which reduced demand and caused eating habits to change. consumers shifted away from food service and increased consumption at home, reducing waste, and increased purchases of lower valued product. our performance improvement initiatives partially offset the negative impact of a weak economic environment in brazil. in europe, results were also negatively impacted by increased competition, primarily in poland, germany and weak economic environments and currency translation in ukraine and russia. results in our asia-pacific operations declined over the prior year primarily driven by lower margins in refined oils and bottling. partially offsetting these decreases in results was improved performance in north america, which benefitted from a combination of a more competitive and higher value product mix and increased demand from the key foodservice channel, as well as cost improvements.
milling products segment ebit decreased to $103 million in 2015 from $131 million in 2014, primarily driven by the weakening economy in brazil which led to softer demand as consumers reduced consumption and trended toward lower priced products. the net impact of the weakening brazilian real relative to the u.s dollar also negatively impacted our results when translating the brazilian real ebit into u.s. dollars. in the united states, results in corn milling were adversely impacted by soft demand in the ready-to-eat cereal and brewery industries; however, our performance improvement initiatives mitigated some of the decline. in mexico, higher volumes and cost synergies from the integration of our mills more than offset slightly lower margins.
sugar and bioenergy segment ebit in 2015 was a loss of $27 million compared to a loss of $168 million in 2014. results were impacted by $5 million of restructuring charges and $133 million of impairment and restructuring charges in 2015 and 2014, respectively. our sugarcane milling business benefited from improved market conditions and good operational performance, as well as disciplined capital management. sg&a costs declined driven by translation benefits from the devaluation of the brazilian real on local currency costs, and cost reduction and efficiency initiatives in our sugar milling business. offsetting these cost improvements were results in our north american ethanol investment which were lower as a decrease in global oil prices resulted in lower ethanol margins. results also decreased in our joint venture for the production of renewable oils in brazil and our corn wet-milling joint venture in argentina. in our trading and merchandising operations, volumes improved over 2014; however, results declined as margins were down as a result of a challenging environment.
fertilizer segment ebit decreased to $5 million in 2015 compared to $45 million in 2014. ebit results declined primarily due to a decrease in usage of fertilizer by farmers in argentina and lower
36
import volumes of fertilizers in our port operations in brazil, both as a result of weaker economic conditions in those countries.
net income attributable to bunge for 2015 was $791 million compared to $515 million for 2014. the increases in total segment ebit totaling $292 million described above combined with reduced net interest cost of $45 million (driven by lower average borrowings during the year) was partially offset by higher income tax expense ($296 million in 2015 compared with $249 million in 2014) as a result of higher income from continuing operations, before taxes. income tax expenses in 2015 included net tax charges of $16 million that resulted primarily from the establishment of income tax valuation allowances in asia-pacific, partially offset by the release of income tax valuation allowances in north america.
segment results bunge has five reportable segmentsagribusiness, edible oil products, milling products, sugar and bioenergy and fertilizerwhich are organized based upon similar economic characteristics and are similar in nature of products and services offered, the nature of production processes, the type and class of customer and distribution methods. the agribusiness segment is characterized by both inputs and outputs being agricultural commodities and thus high volume and low margin. the edible oil products segment involves the manufacturing and marketing of products derived from vegetable oils. the milling products segment involves the manufacturing and marketing of products derived primarily from wheat and corn. the sugar and bioenergy segment involves sugarcane growing and milling in brazil, sugar and ethanol trading and merchandising in various countries, as well as sugarcane-based ethanol production and corn-based ethanol investments and related activities. the fertilizer segment includes the activities of our port operations in brazil and argentina and blending and distribution operations in argentina.

total segment earnings before interest and tax ("ebit") is an operating performance measure used by bunge's management to evaluate its segments' operating activities. total segment ebit is a non-u.s. gaap financial measure and is not intended to replace net income attributable to bunge, the most directly comparable u.s. gaap financial measure. bunge's management believes segment ebit is a useful measure of its segments' operating profitability, since the measure allows for an evaluation of the performance of its segments without regard to its financing methods or capital structure. in addition, ebit is a financial measure that is widely used by analysts and investors in bunge's industries. total segment ebit is not a measure of consolidated operating results under u.s. gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to bunge or any other measure of consolidated operating results under u.s. gaap.
a reconciliation of total segment ebit to net income attributable to bunge follows:

internal control over financial reporting in connection with the 2015 year-end closing process, we determined that there was a classification error in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows in our previously issued interim consolidated financial statements contained in our quarterly report on form 10-q for the quarter ended september 30, 2015, which overstated operating cash flows and understated investing cash flows in the same amount. this error did not affect our previously reported volumes, gross profit, segment operating profit, net income or earnings per share or our balance sheets for any period. we have determined that the identified cause of this error represents a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. we have taken, and will continue to take, actions to remediate this weakness. see "item 9a. controls and procedures" for more information.
2015 compared to 2014
agribusiness segmentagribusiness segment net sales decreased 26% to $31.3 billion in 2015 compared to $42.1 billion in 2014. the decrease was primarily driven by significantly lower global
39
commodity prices in 2015 compared to 2014, especially soybean prices which were on average 24% lower. volumes decreased 3% driven by lower grain origination and grain and oilseed trading and distribution volumes, partially offset by higher oilseed processing volumes. in our grains business, origination volumes declined in north america due to lower farmer selling and a reduction in volumes related to the sale of certain canadian grain assets in the third quarter to g3 canada limited (formerly the canadian wheat board). argentina grain origination was down as farmers retained their crops in anticipation of a more favorable environment following the december presidential election. the reduced grain origination volumes in north america and argentina were partly offset by higher volumes in brazil during the latter part of 2015 as farmers were strong sellers in order to fix their local brazilian real sales at relatively high rates as the brazilian real weakened against the u.s. dollar. in oilseed processing, higher volumes in north america, asia, brazil and argentina driven by strong crush margins were fully offset by lower global commodity prices. in our trading and distribution businesses, volumes were lower in both grains and oilseeds in most regions due to a soft margin environment.
cost of goods sold decreased by 27% to $29.4 billion in 2015, compared with $40.4 billion last year as a result of lower global commodity prices and the translation effect of weaker global currencies compared with 2014. the average global price of soybeans, corn and wheat declined 24%, 9% and 14%, respectively in 2015 compared to 2014. the volume decline of 3% noted above also contributed to the decline in cost of goods sold. improvement in ocean freight costs, particularly bunker fuel procurement, and in ports and services also contributed to the lower year-over-year cost. in addition, in the second quarter of 2015 we reversed a $30 million export tax contingency in our argentine subsidiary.
gross profit increased 7% to $1,858 million in 2015 from $1,742 million in 2014, primarily driven by improved performance in our oilseed processing business, particularly in china, argentina, the u.s., and brazil, partially offset by declines in softeed processing in europe and canada. grain trading and distribution also benefitted from improved ocean freight costs and port logistics operations. these increases more than offset weak grain origination margins in the united states primarily driven by lack of export demand due to the impacts of stronger u.s. dollar.
sg&a expenses were $851 million in 2015 compared to $875 million in 2014. sg&a benefitted in 2015 from weaker currencies as local currency costs were translated into u.s. dollars, partially offset by an impairment charge of $14 million in our equity method investment in a freight shipping company and a $9 million charge of administrative tax assessment fees related to export activities in our argentine subsidiary for 2008 through 2009.
foreign exchange gains were $67 million in 2015 compared to gains of $39 million in the same period of 2014. these results were primarily driven by movements in the brazilian real and the argentine peso.
noncontrolling interests represent (income) loss attributed to the noncontrolling interest holders in joint venture operations that are consolidated in our financial statements. the income of $9 million in 2015 compared to income of $23 million in 2014 and was primarily driven by lower results in our u.s. pacific northwest port operation and oilseed and biodiesel production joint ventures in europe.
gain on the sale of canadian grain assets to g3 canada limited (formerly the canadian wheat board) was $47 million.
segment ebit increased 24% to $1,108 million in 2015 from $890 million in 2014 primarily as a result of improved gross profit in our oilseed processing business, grain trading and distribution business, a reduction in sg&a, primarily from the weakening of global currencies against the u.s. dollar and a $47 million gain on the sale of certain assets in canada to g3 canada limited.
edible oil products segmentedible oil products segment net sales were $6.7 billion in 2015 compared to $8.0 billion in 2014. the lower net sales in 2015 were primarily a result of lower global
40
vegetable oil prices and the translation impact of weaker global currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. volumes in 2015 were essentially flat as higher demand in india and china were offset by a decline in brazil and europe, resulting from weak economic conditions, which directly impacted packaged oil and margarine demand.
cost of goods sold decreased 15% to $6.3 billion in 2015 from $7.4 billion in 2014, due to lower raw material costs resulting from market price declines of edible oils, lower demand in brazil and europe, which lowered production volumes, and the translation impact of the weaker global currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. cost of goods sold in 2015 included an impairment charge of $15 million related to the announced closure of one of our u.s. edible oil packaging facilities.
gross profit in 2015 decreased to $404 million from $548 million in 2014. the decrease was driven by lower volumes and margins in brazil and europe as consumers reduced purchases and traded down to lower value products. the impact of the weaker economic environment was partly offset by cost benefits from our performance improvement programs. an impairment charge of $15 million in 2015 relating to the closure of a u.s. facility also contributed to the reduced gross profit.
sg&a expenses decreased to $328 million in 2015 from $482 million in 2014, primarily as a result of the translation benefits of the strengthening u.s. dollar relative to other global currencies, notably the brazilian real, argentine peso and  euro as well as our cost reduction initiatives. in addition, 2014 included $98 million of expenses related to certain icms tax credits in brazil.
a goodwill impairment charge of $13 million, representing all of the goodwill of the brazilian tomato products business, was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 upon completion of our annual impairment analysis.
segment ebit was $59 million in 2015 compared to $58 million in 2014. ebit for 2015 included a charge of $15 million for the announced closure of a packaged oil plant in the united states and a $13 million goodwill impairment charge in our brazilian tomato products business. ebit for 2014 included an expense of $98 million related to certain icms tax credits in brazil. excluding the effects of these items, results declined by $69 million driven by lower volumes and margins in brazil edible oils, and margarines in europe as consumers pulled-back on purchases and traded down to lower value products. this was partially offset by lower sg&a expenses as a result of the factors noted above.
milling products segmentmilling products segment sales decreased by 22% to $1,609 million in 2015 from $2,064 million in 2014 in part due to approximately 9% lower average prices for corn and 14% lower average prices for wheat. volumes declined 7% compared to the same period last year, primarily in our wheat milling business in brazil, which was impacted by the weak economic environment that depressed demand, as well as in our u.s. corn milling operations, driven by soft demand in the ready-to-eat cereal and brewery industries. additionally, the foreign exchange impact from the devaluation of the brazilian real and mexican  peso against the u.s. dollar for our brazilian and mexican operations negatively impacted sales.
cost of goods sold decreased 22% to $1,372 million in 2015 from $1,753 million in 2014 primarily due to lower volumes, lower commodity raw material costs in corn and wheat and the translation impact of the devaluation of the brazilian real and mexican peso against the u.s. dollar.
gross profit decreased to $237 million in 2015, from $311 million in 2014, primarily due to lower volumes and margins in brazil related to food service and retail channels and lower volumes in u.s. corn milling as a result of depressed demand from the ready-to-eat cereal and brewery industries in the first half of 2015. margins in brazil were adversely impacted by the effects of the currency devaluation.
sg&a expenses decreased by $45 million to $123 million in 2015 from $168 million in 2014 mainly resulting from the benefit of the weaker brazilian  real and mexican peso on the translation of local
41
currency expenses. in addition, 2014 included $14 million of expenses related to certain icms tax credits in brazil.
segment ebit decreased to $103 million in 2015 from $131 million in 2014, as weaker demand in brazil and the u.s. resulted in lower volumes and margins, partially offset by lower sg&a expenses.
sugar and bioenergy segmentsugar and bioenergy segment net sales decreased to $3.5 billion in 2015 compared to $4.5 billion in 2014. the 23% decrease in sales was primarily driven by lower global average prices of sugar and the significant devaluation of the brazilian real impacting our local currency net sales when translated into u.s. dollars. this was partially offset by higher average domestic ethanol prices in brazil and an increase in volumes. on average, the futures price of raw sugar was 20% lower in 2015 compared 2014. average ethanol prices in brazil were higher by 8% driven by a large increase in the fourth quarter. partially offsetting the sales decreases was an improvement in volumes of 8% compared to 2014, primarily due to increased activity in our global trading and merchandising operations.
cost of goods sold decreased 27% to $3.3 billion in 2015, compared to $4.6 billion in 2014, primarily driven by lower prices of purchased sugarcane and the impact of the weaker brazilian real relative to the u.s. dollar, partially offset by higher volumes.
gross profit was $164 million in 2015. this compared to a loss of $41 million in 2014, which included $113 million of impairment and related charges related to one of our sugar mills. excluding the impairment and related charges, results improved by $92 million primarily driven by improved results in our industrial operations resulting from increased efficiency, both in volumes crushed and lower related industrial costs, as well as higher volumes and margins in cogeneration. in our global trading and distribution operations, higher volumes were more than offset by lower margins.
sg&a expenses were $109 million in 2015, 30% lower compared to $156 million in 2014, driven by translation benefits of the devaluation of the brazilian  real on local currency costs, and cost reduction and efficiency initiatives in our sugar milling business. in addition, 2015 and 2014 included $5 million and $20 million, respectively, of restructuring costs, which include costs of our strategic review of the sugar milling business.
foreign exchange results in 2015 were losses of $68 million, compared to gains of $19 million in 2014. these results were related primarily to results on certain currency hedges.
other income (expenses)net was expense of $15 million in 2015 compared to income of $10 million in 2014. results in our north american ethanol investment were lower as the decrease in global oil prices resulted in lower ethanol margins. results also decreased in our joint venture for the production of renewable oils in brazil and our corn wet-milling joint venture in argentina.
segment ebit improved by $141 million to a loss of $27 million in 2015, compared to a loss of $168 million in 2014. results were impacted by $5 million of restructuring charges and $133 million of impairment and restructuring charges in 2015 and 2014, respectively. excluding the impairment and restructuring charges, results improved by $13 million due to improved performance in our industrial milling operations in brazil and lower sg&a expenses from the translation benefit of the weaker brazilian  real on local currency costs, partially offset by foreign exchange losses and lower results in certain joint ventures.
fertilizer segmentfertilizer segment net sales decreased 19% to $386 million in 2015 compared to $474 million in 2014, primarily due to lower fertilizer imports in brazil. in argentina, sales declined mainly due to lower volumes driven by reduced fertilizer usage by argentine farmers as a result of the local economic environment and lower farm margins for corn and wheat production. in addition, in the first quarter of 2015, volumes were reduced due to a strike at one of our facilities.
42
cost of goods sold was $356 million in 2015, compared to $413 million in 2014. lower volumes and raw material costs and the translation benefit of the weaker argentine peso, were partly offset by higher cost imports of nitrogen due to the aforementioned strike.
gross profit decreased to $30 million in 2015 from $61 million in 2014. the decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes and not fully recovered industrial costs in our brazilian port operations. gross profit in our argentine operation was impacted by higher production costs, depressed volumes from lower farmer fertilizer usage and impacts of a strike at one of our facilities.
sg&a was $24 million in 2015 compared to $10 million in 2014. the lower expense in 2014 includes the reversal of certain value added tax, labor and bad debt provisions in brazil.
noncontrolling interests represents (income) loss attributed to the noncontrolling interest holders in operations that are consolidated in our financial statements. the $1 million income in 2015 and $5 million income in 2014 represents the noncontrolling interests share of income at our non-wholly owned brazilian port operations.
segment ebit decreased to $5 million in 2015, compared to $45 million in 2014, mainly driven by lower gross profit in our brazilian port operations, the impact of the strike and weaker farmer usage of fertilizer in argentina and the positive sg&a impact on 2014 results interesta summary of consolidated interest income and expense for the periods indicated follows:

interest income         $43            $87
interest expense       (258   )       (347   )
interest income decreased to $44 million when compared to the same period of 2014, as a result of lower cash investments in brazil and argentina and $12 million of accumulated interest on a loan provided to and repaid by a related party in 2014. interest expense decreased by 26% compared to last year, primarily due to lower average outstanding debt, mainly as a result of reduced working capital requirements due to lower global commodity prices in 2015 and interest charges of $65 million related to certain icms tax credits in brazil.
income tax expensein 2015, income tax expense from continuing operations increased to $296 million from $249 million in 2014 and the effective tax rate in 2015 decreased to 28% compared to 34% in 2014. income tax expenses in 2015 included net tax charges of $16 million that resulted primarily from the establishment of income tax valuation allowances in asia-pacific partially offset by the release of income tax valuation allowances in north america. the lower effective tax rate for 2015 resulted mainly from geographical earnings mix and valuation allowance movements.
discontinued operationsdiscontinued operations results in 2015 were income of $35 million, net of tax, compared to income of $32 million, net of tax, in 2014. results in 2015, included gains in brazilian fertilizer driven by foreign exchange gains and the recovery of previously written-off farmer receivables, which were partly offset by losses in our asset management business. results in 2014 included benefits related to a tax amnesty program in brazil and collections of previously written-off farmer receivables.
net income attributable to bungenet income attributable to bunge for 2015 was $791 million compared to $515 million for 2014. the increase in total segment ebit of $292 million discussed above and reduced net interest cost of $45 million driven by lower average borrowings during the year was partially offset by the higher income tax expense ($296 million in 2015 compared with $249 million in 2014) on the higher income from continuing operations, before taxes.
43
2014 compared to 2013
agribusiness segmentagribusiness segment net sales decreased 8% to $42.1 billion in 2014 compared to $45.5 billion in 2013. volumes were 1% higher in the year with increased volumes of grain origination in europe resulting from good crops and harvest pace in the black sea region being offset by lower oilseeds distribution volumes in asia-pacific and processing in china and argentina. global commodity prices were generally lower in the year; especially corn prices, which declined significantly in the first nine months of the year and were on average 28% lower in 2014 compared to 2013. the impact of lower commodity prices on net sales was partly offset by the higher value mix of commodities sold in 2014 when compared with 2013.
cost of goods sold also decreased by 8% to $40.4 billion in 2014, compared with $43.7 billion last year as a result of lower average commodity prices in 2014 and lower results from trading and our risk management strategies. these reductions were only partly offset by the 1% volume increase and higher value sales mix.
gross profit was $1,742 million in 2014, 3% lower than $1,797 million a year ago, primarily as losses in our asia-pacific oilseed processing operations, mainly in china, resulting from low structural margins in the region, and reduced trading and risk management results and approximately $80 million of unrealized mark-to-market impacts related to north american processing and bunker fuel hedges at year end that are expected to reverse in 2014. these reductions more than offset good margins in north and south america, central europe and our oilseed distribution activities to the middle east.
sg&a expenses were $875 million in 2014 compared to $836 million in 2013. in 2014, sg&a expenses included costs from our new terfron port facility in northern brazil and higher employee related costs and, to a lesser extent, higher bad debt expenses. sg&a benefitted from weaker currencies when local currency costs were translated into u.s. dollars, partially offsetting the expense increases.
noncontrolling interests represent (income) loss attributed to the noncontrolling interest holders in joint venture operations that are consolidated in our financial statements. in 2014, $23 million of income compared to losses of $31 million in 2013. improved performance in our joint venture activities was primarily driven by our u.s. pacific northwest port operation and oilseed and biodiesel production ventures in europe.
segment ebit decreased to $890 million in 2014 from $1,032 million in 2013, primarily due to lower gross profit, higher sg&a and approximately $80 million of mark-to-market impacts incurred in the fourth quarter, which are expected to reverse during 2014. ebit for 2013 included a $16 million gain from the sale of certain legal claims in brazil.
edible oil products segmentedible oil products segment net sales were $8 billion in 2014 compared to $9.2 billion in 2013. the lower net sales in 2014 were primarily a result of lower average commodity prices in 2014. volumes decreased by 2% driven by rail logistics issues and soft demand from food processors in north america, and by lower retail demand and implementation of price management strategies in brazil. volumes were positively impacted in argentina by export sales of bulk oil and in asia-pacific with strong volume growth across all our brands and our bakery fats business in india.
cost of goods sold decreased 14% to $7.4 billion in 2014 from $8.6 billion in 2013, primarily due to lower raw material costs resulting from lower global commodity prices and sales volumes.
gross profit in 2014 increased to $548 million from $540 million in 2013, primarily due to higher margins in brazil, driven by a tight supply environment and an increased focus on operational improvements and price management strategies, and in argentina, driven by higher export volumes within south america. margins in north america were essentially flat, with higher margins in u.s.
44
packaged oils driven by operational improvement programs, partially offset by lower margins in refined oils on weaker export demand, rail logistics issues and, to a lesser extent, higher energy costs in the first quarter due to severe weather conditions in canada.
sg&a expenses increased to $482 million in 2014 from $384 million in 2013; sg&a for 2014 included $98 million expenses on certain icms tax credits in brazil.
segment ebit decreased to $58 million in 2014 from $163 million in 2013 as a result of factors noted above. segment ebit for 2013 included a gain of $9 million from the sale of certain legal claims in brazil.
milling products segmentmilling products segment net sales were $2,064 million in 2014, compared to $2,012 million in 2013. volumes increased by 12% primarily due to contributions from a wheat milling business in mexico, which we acquired in december 2013. this increase was partly offset by lower volumes in our wheat milling business in brazil, primarily due to our strategy to strengthen margins. the net increase in volumes was offset by lower average selling prices for corn and wheat products driven by lower average global commodity market prices relative to last year and by the impact of a weaker brazilian real and mexican  peso when translated into u.s. dollars compared to 2013.
cost of goods sold was essentially flat with $1,753 million and $1,750 million for the years 2014 and 2013, respectively. the impact of the inclusion of the acquired wheat milling business in mexico and higher prices for rice origination in the united states resulting from drought and water shortage was offset by lower prices for corn and wheat compared to the same period last year.
gross profit increased by 19% to $311 million in 2014 from $262 million in 2013, primarily as a result of inclusion of our mexican wheat milling business acquired in december 2013 and the related synergies with our existing wheat milling business in mexico. in addition, margins were higher in brazil resulting from the implementation of price management strategies. in our u.s. milling operations, gross profit declined with lower margins in corn milling only partly offset by stronger margins in rice milling.
sg&a expenses increased by $29 million to $168 million in 2014 from $139 million in 2013, primarily resulting from inclusion of our wheat milling business acquired in mexico at the end of last year and $14 million expenses on certain icms tax credits in brazil, partially offset by the benefits of cost reduction initiatives and the impact of the weaker brazilian real and mexican peso on the translation of local currency expenses to the u.s. dollar.
segment ebit increased by 5% to $131 million in 2014 from $125 million in the same period a year ago, driven by the inclusion of our acquired wheat milling operations in mexico and solid performance in brazil wheat milling and u.s. rice milling, partly offset by higher sg&a expenses, lower results in u.s. corn milling and foreign exchange losses in mexico driven by a strong devaluation of the mexican peso in the fourth quarter. segment ebit for 2013 included a gain of $6 million from the sale of certain legal claims in brazil.
sugar and bioenergy segmentsugar and bioenergy segment net sales increased 8% to $4.5 billion in 2014 compared to $4.2 billion in 2013, as a result of higher sugarcane milling volumes and energy sales in brazil. these increases were partly offset by a 6% decline in volumes, primarily in our trading and merchandising business. average ethanol and energy prices in brazil were higher compared to 2013, while average prices of sugar were lower. in our biofuels business, lower volumes were more than offset by higher u.s. corn ethanol prices.
cost of goods sold increased to $4.6 billion in 2014 from $4.1 billion in 2013. higher costs of purchased sugarcane were partially offset by lower volumes in our trading and merchandising business and the benefit of the weaker brazilian real relative to the u.s. dollar.
45
gross profit was a loss of $41 million in 2014, driven by $113 million of impairment and related charges related to one of our mills. this compared to a profit of $92 million in 2013. improved overall results in our other sugarcane mills were driven by lower costs, higher margins and increased cogeneration volumes. these improvements were more than offset by lower results in our sugar trading and distribution business.
sg&a expenses declined 6% to $156 million in 2014 from $166 million in 2013. cost reduction initiatives in our sugar milling business and translation benefits from the depreciation of the brazilian real on local currency costs reduced sg&a, but were partially offset by $20 million of restructuring costs, including costs of our strategic review of the business. sg&a for 2013 included $11 million of write-offs and restructuring charges.
other income (expenses)net was income of $10 million compared to nil in 2013. increased income from our non-consolidated investments in a u.s. bioenergy producer and a corn wet milling venture in argentina that became fully operational in 2014, was partially offset by losses in our joint venture for the production of renewable oils in brazil.
segment ebit decreased by $108 million to a loss of $168 million in 2014 compared to a loss of $60 million in 2013. in 2014, segment ebit included $133 million of impairment and restructuring charges in our industrial operations. results from our sugarcane mills improved overall and our bioenergy investments in the u.s. and argentina also reported higher results. these improvements were partly offset by weaker trading and merchandising results and start-up losses in our renewable oils venture in brazil.
fertilizer segmentfertilizer segment net sales increased 6% to $474 million in 2014 compared to $448 million in 2013, primarily due to a volume increase of 14% in our argentine blending and distribution operations, partly offset by lower global nitrogen and phosphate prices.
cost of goods sold increased 9% to $413 million in 2014 from $379 million in 2013, primarily as a result of higher volumes and higher equipment rental costs and spare parts write-offs in our brazil port operations. these increases were partly offset by lower raw material costs and the benefit of the weaker argentine peso and brazilian real on local currency costs when translated into u.s. dollars.
gross profit decreased to $61 million in 2014 from $69 million in 2013. the decrease was primarily driven by higher costs in our brazilian port operations, partly offset by higher volumes and margins in argentina.
sg&a was $10 million in 2014 compared to $34 million in 2013. the decrease in 2014 includes the reversal of certain value added tax provisions which are no longer expected to be paid and lower general and administrative expenses. in addition, sg&a benefited from a weaker brazilian real and argentine  peso relative to the u.s. dollar.
segment ebit decreased by $24 million to $45 million in 2014 from $69 million in 2013, primarily due to a $32 million gain on the 2013 sale of certain legal claims in brazil, partially offset by a $5 million loss in 2013 in our morocco phosphate joint venture, which was sold in december 2013.
interesta summary of consolidated interest income and expense for the periods indicated follows:

interest income         $87            $76
interest expense       (347   )       (363   )
interest income in 2014 increased by $11 million compared to 2013, primarily due to higher returns on cash investments in brazil and argentina in the first half of the year and the collection of
46
$12 million of accumulated unpaid interest on a loan provided to a related party. interest expense decreased by 4% compared to last year, primarily due to lower average outstanding debt driven by reduced working capital requirements as a result of lower average commodity prices, partly offset by interest charges of $65 million related to certain icms tax credits in brazil. interest expenses were reduced due to the refinancing of long-term debt at fixed rates with short-term bank loans, which on average bear lower, floating interest rates. interest expense includes facility commitment fees, amortization of deferred financing costs and charges on certain lending transactions, including certain intercompany loans and foreign currency conversions in brazil.
income tax expensein 2014, income tax expense from continuing operations decreased to $249 million from $904 million in 2013 and the effective tax rate in 2014 decreased to 34% compared to 89% in 2013. income tax expense in 2014 included certain income tax benefits of $102 million, primarily $93 million of deferred tax assets in a subsidiary taxable in brazil, $21 million reversal of an income tax valuation allowance in europe and $13 million from adjustment of provisions upon finalization of a tax audit in europe. also, included in income tax expense for 2014 is $45 million of deferred tax assets which were recognized upon the recording of expenses related to a court ruling related to certain icms tax credits in brazil. these items were partly offset by $15 million of income tax valuation allowances resulting from management's evaluation of the recoverability of its net operating loss carryforwards in asia-pacific. net tax expense for 2013 included tax charges of $512 million for income tax valuation allowances, primarily in the sugar and bioenergy segment from management's evaluation of its net deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss carryforwards, $46 million as a result of new legal precedents that impacted our assessment of an uncertain income tax position in brazil and provisions related to tax years 2008 through 2010.
discontinued operationsdiscontinued operations results in 2014 were income of $32 million, net of tax, compared to income of $97 million, net of tax, in 2013. results in 2014 included benefits related to a tax amnesty program in brazil and collections of previously written-off farmer receivables. results in 2013 represented primarily the gain on the sale of the fertilizer blending and distribution business of $112 million, net of tax.
net income attributable to bungenet income attributable to bunge for 2014 was $515 million compared to $306 million for 2013. the decrease in total segment ebit of $373 million discussed above was more than offset by the significantly lower income tax expense from continuing operations ($249 million in 2014 compared with $904 million in 2013). income tax expenses in 2014 included net tax benefits of $102 million that resulted primarily from the establishment of deferred tax assets related to the implementation of certain structural changes in our agribusiness operations. income tax expense for 2013 included charges of $512 million for income tax valuation allowances, primarily in our sugar milling business in brazil. net income for 2013 also included a $112 million after-tax gain on the sale of our fertilizer distribution business in brazil to yara for cash of $750 million. this gain is included in discontinued operations.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity our main financial objectives are to prudently manage financial risks, ensure consistent access to liquidity and minimize cost of capital in order to efficiently finance our business and maintain balance sheet strength. we generally finance our ongoing operations with cash flows generated from operations, issuance of commercial paper, borrowings under various bilateral and syndicated revolving credit facilities, term loans and proceeds from the issuance of senior notes. acquisitions and long-lived assets are generally financed with a combination of equity and long-term debt.
47
our current ratio, which is a widely used measure of liquidity and is defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, was 1.49 and 1.50 at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
cash and cash equivalentscash and cash equivalents were $411 million at december 31, 2015 and $362 million at december 31, 2014. cash balances are managed in accordance with our investment policy, the objectives of which are to preserve the principal value of our cash assets, maintain a high degree of liquidity and deliver competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions. cash balances are invested in short-term deposits with highly rated financial institutions and in u.s. government securities.
readily marketable inventories ("rmi")rmi are agricultural commodity inventories, such as soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, corn, wheat, and sugar that are readily convertible to cash because of their commodity characteristics, widely available markets and international pricing mechanisms. rmi in our agribusiness segment are reported at fair value and were $3,393 million at december 31, 2015 and $4,125 million at december 31, 2014. of these amounts $2,513 million and $2,937 million were attributable to merchandising activities at december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively. rmi at fair value in the aggregate amount of $110 million and $127 million at december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively, were included in our edible oil products segment inventories. the sugar and bioenergy segment included sugar rmi of $163 million and $157 million at december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively which can be attributed to our trading and merchandising business.
financing arrangements and outstanding indebtednesswe conduct most of our financing activities through a centralized financing structure that provides the company efficient access to debt and capital markets. this structure includes a master trust, the primary assets of which consist of intercompany loans made to bunge limited and its subsidiaries. certain of bunge limited's 100% owned finance subsidiaries, bunge limited finance corp., bunge finance europe b.v. and bunge asset funding corp., fund the master trust with short and long-term debt obtained from third parties, including through our commercial paper program and certain credit facilities, as well as the issuance of senior notes. borrowings by these finance subsidiaries carry full, unconditional guarantees by bunge limited.
revolving credit facilitiesat december 31, 2015, we had $5,015 million of aggregate committed borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program and revolving various bilateral and syndicated credit facilities, of which $4,263 million was unused and available. the following table summarizes these facilities as of the periods presented:

commercial paper                 2019                   $600              $            $

(1)
borrowings under the revolving credit facilities that have maturities greater than one year from the date of the consolidated balance sheets are classified as long-term debt, consistent with the long-term maturity of the underlying facilities. however, individual borrowings under the revolving credit facilities are generally short-term in nature, bear interest at variable rates and can be repaid or renewed as each such individual borrowing matures.
on august 10, 2015, we entered into an amendment agreement to our unsecured $1,750 million syndicated revolving credit facility, dated march 17, 2014 (the "facility"). the amendment agreement
48
extends the maturity date of the facility to august 10, 2018. we have the option to request an extension of the maturity date of the facility for two additional one-year periods. each lender in its sole discretion may agree to any such request. the amendment agreement also lowers the range of margin applicable to our borrowings under the facility. borrowings under the facility will bear interest at libor plus a margin, which will vary from 0.35% to 1.35% per annum, based on the credit ratings of our senior long-term unsecured debt. we will also pay a fee that varies from 0.10% to 0.40% per annum, based on the utilization of the facility. amounts under the facility that remain undrawn are subject to a commitment fee payable quarterly in arrears at a rate of 35% of the margin specified above, which will vary based on the rating level at each quarterly payment date. we may, from time-to-time, with the consent of the facility agent, request one or more of the existing lenders or new lenders to increase the total commitments under the facility by up to $250 million pursuant to an accordion provision. at december 31, 2015, we had $277 million of borrowings outstanding under the facility.
our commercial paper program is supported by committed back-up bank credit lines (the "liquidity facility") equal to the amount of the commercial paper program provided by lending institutions that are required to be rated at least a-1 by standard & poor's and p-1 by moody's investor services. the cost of borrowing under the liquidity facility would typically be higher than the cost of issuance under our commercial paper program. at december 31, 2015, there were no borrowings outstanding under both the commercial paper program and the liquidity facility. the liquidity facility is our only revolving credit facility that requires lenders to maintain minimum credit ratings.
in addition to committed credit facilities, from time-to-time, we, through our financing subsidiaries, enter into bilateral short-term credit lines as necessary based on our financing requirements. at december 31, 2015 and 2014, nil and $50 million, respectively, were outstanding under these bilateral short-term credit lines.
short and long-term debtour short and long-term debt increased by $594 million at december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014, primarily due to funding additional working capital requirements at year end. for the year ended december 31, 2015, our average short and long-term debt outstanding was approximately $4,316 million compared to approximately $5,372 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily due to lower average working capital financing requirements, driven by lower average global commodity prices. our long-term debt outstanding balance was $3,803 million at december 31, 2015 compared to $3,263 million at december 31, 2014. the following table summarizes our short-term debt activity at december 31, 2015.

on november 24, 2015, we completed the issuance of an aggregate principal amount sale of $500 million of unsecured senior notes bearing interest at 3.50% per annum and maturing on november 24, 2020. the senior notes were issued by our 100% owned finance subsidiary, bunge limited finance corp., and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by bunge limited. interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in may and november of each year, commencing on may 24, 2016. the net proceeds from this offering of approximately $496 million after deducting
49
underwriters' commissions and offering expenses were used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to the repayment of outstanding indebtedness, which includes indebtedness under our revolving credit facilities. debt issuance costs of approximately $4 million were paid in conjunction with the issuance of the senior notes and will be amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the five-year term of the senior notes.

credit ratingsbunge's debt ratings and outlook by major credit rating agencies at december 31, 2015 were as follows:

(1)
short-term rating applies only to bunge asset funding corp., the issuer under our commercial paper program.
our debt agreements do not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate maturity of our debt. however, credit rating downgrades would increase our borrowing costs under our syndicated credit facilities and, depending on their severity, could impede our ability to obtain credit facilities or access the capital markets in the future on competitive terms. a significant increase in our borrowing costs could impair our ability to compete effectively in our business relative to competitors with higher credit ratings.
our credit facilities and certain senior notes require us to comply with specified financial covenants, including minimum net worth, minimum current ratio, a maximum debt to capitalization ratio and limitations on secured indebtedness. we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31, 2015.
trade receivable securitization programwe initially entered into our trade receivable securitization program (the "program") in june 2011, which provides us with an additional source of liquidity. the program provides funding of up to $700 million against receivables sold and terminates on june 1, 2016.
at december 31, 2015 and 2014, $524 million and $599 million, respectively, of receivables sold under the program were derecognized from our consolidated balance sheets. proceeds received in cash related to transfers of receivables under the program totaled $10,396 million and $12,030 million for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. in addition, cash collections from customers on receivables previously sold were $10,542 million and $12,202 million for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. as this is a revolving facility, cash collections from customers are reinvested to fund new receivable sales. gross receivables sold under the program for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 were $10,601 million and $12,179 million, respectively. these sales resulted in discounts of $5 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, $7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 and $7 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, which were included in sg&a in the consolidated statements of income. servicing fees under the program were not significant in any period.
our risk of loss following the sale of the trade receivables is limited to the deferred purchase price receivable ("dpp"), which at december 31, 2015 and 2014 had a fair value of $79 million and $78 million, respectively, and is included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets (see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements). the dpp will be repaid in cash as receivables are collected, generally within 30 days. delinquencies and credit losses on trade receivables sold under the program during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were insignificant. we have reflected all cash flows under the program as operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014.
interest rate swap agreementswe may use interest rate swaps as hedging instruments and record the swaps at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded contemporaneously in earnings. additionally, the carrying amount of the associated debt is adjusted
51
through earnings for changes in the fair value due to changes in benchmark interest rates. ineffectiveness, as defined in asc topic 815 derivatives and hedging, is recognized to the extent that these two adjustments do not offset.
equitytotal equity is set forth in the following table:

total bunge shareholders' equity decreased to $6,652 million at december 31, 2015 from $8,690 million at december 31, 2014. the change in equity was primarily due to cumulative translation losses of $2,546 million, resulting from the devaluation of global currencies relative to the u.s. dollar in 2015, declared dividends to common and preferred shareholders of $212 million and $34 million and treasury shares acquired of $300 million, respectively, partially offset by net income attributable to bunge for the year ended december 31, 2015 of $791 million.
noncontrolling interest decreased to $211 million at december 31, 2015 from $244 million at december 31, 2014 primarily due to return of shareholders capital to one of our noncontrolling interests in the united states and the impact of currency translation.
at december 31, 2015, we had 6,900,000 4.875% cumulative convertible perpetual preference shares outstanding with an aggregate liquidation preference of $690 million. each convertible perpetual preference share has an initial liquidation preference of $100, which will be adjusted for any accumulated and unpaid dividends. the convertible perpetual preference shares carry an annual dividend of $4.875 per share payable quarterly. as a result of adjustments made to the initial conversion price because cash dividends paid on bunge limited's common shares exceeded certain specified thresholds, each convertible perpetual preference share is convertible, at the holder's option, at any time into 1.1331 bunge limited common shares, based on the conversion price of $88.2501 per share, subject to certain additional anti-dilution adjustments (which represents 7,818,390 bunge limited common shares at december 31, 2015). at any time, if the closing price of our common shares equals or exceeds 130% of the conversion price for 20 trading days during any consecutive 30 trading days (including the last trading day of such period), we may elect to cause the convertible perpetual preference shares to be automatically converted into bunge limited common shares at the then-prevailing conversion price. the convertible perpetual preference shares are not redeemable by us at any time.
cash flows our cash flow from operations varies depending on, among other items, the market prices and timing of the purchase and sale of our inventories. generally, during periods when commodity prices are rising, our agribusiness operations require increased use of cash to support working capital to acquire inventories and fund daily settlement requirements on exchange traded futures that we use to minimize price risk related to our inventories.

2015 compared to 2014in 2015, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $49 million reflecting the net effect of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. for the year ended december 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $380 million.
cash provided by our operating activities was $610 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $1,399 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. net cash inflows from operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2015 were principally due to net income, including adjustments for non-cash items, partially offset by an increase in the use of cash for net operating assets and liabilities. the increase in net operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to increases in secured advances to farmers in south america who were motivated to sell their record level crops as the brazilian real and argentine peso depreciated relative to the u.s. dollar. the net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2014 were principally due to net income, including adjustments for non-cash items. the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities in 2014 is primarily due to lower working capital levels than at december 31, 2013, resulting from, on average, lower global commodity prices, which effect was partially offset by the impact of the depreciation from certain currencies including the brazilian real, argentine  peso, ukranian hryvnia and the euro relative to the u.s. dollar.
certain of our non-u.s. operating subsidiaries are primarily funded with u.s. dollar-denominated debt, while currency risk is hedged with u.s. dollar denominated assets. the functional currency of our operating subsidiaries is generally the local currency. also, certain of our u.s. dollar functional operating subsidiaries outside the united states are partially funded with local currency borrowings, while the currency risk is hedged with local currency denominated assets. the financial statements of our subsidiaries are calculated in the functional currency, and when the local currency is the functional currency, translated into u.s. dollar. u.s. dollar-denominated loans are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates at the applicable balance sheet date. local currency loans are remeasured into u.s. dollar at the exchange rate at the applicable balance sheet date. the resulting gain or loss is included in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange gains or losses. for the years ended december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, we recorded foreign exchange gains of $213 million and $215 million, respectively, which were included as adjustments to reconcile net income to cash used for operating activities in the line item "foreign exchange loss (gain) on debt" in our consolidated statements of cash flows. this adjustment is required because the cash flow impacts of these gains or losses are non-cash items and will represent financing activities when the subsidiary repays the underlying debt and therefore, have no impact on cash flows from operations.
cash used for investing activities was $802 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to cash used of $685 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. during 2015, payments made for capital expenditures of $649 million were primarily related to replanting of sugarcane and maintenance and improvements for our industrial sugar business in brazil, upgrade and expansion of an export terminal in the united states, construction of a wheat milling facility in brazil, the expansion of a port facility in ukraine and construction of oilseed processing plants in ukraine and in asia-pacific. we also acquired moinho pacifico, a brazilian wheat mill and port terminal in santos, brazil, whole harvest foods, a u.s. refiner and packager of expeller pressed commercial cooking oil and heartland harvest, inc. ("hhi"), a u.s. based producer of die cut pellets for the snack food industry, and the remaining interest in a spanish biodiesel production facility. settlement of net investment hedges totaled $203 million. proceeds from sales of investment in affiliates included net proceeds of $88 million for the sale of certain assets in our grain business in canada to g3 canada limited (formerly the canadian wheat board). capital expenditures in 2015 were $649 million, 23% lower compared to $839 million in 2014, as a result of management's disciplined capital management and generally lower capital expenditures in our industrial sugar and bioenergy operations in brazil. proceeds from and payments for investments for both years 2015 and 2014 included primarily sales of assets in funds in our asset management business and the purchases and sales of certain marketable
53
securities and other short term investments. investments in affiliates in 2015 included our payment for our share of g3 canada limited (formerly the canadian wheat board) and additional investments in sb oils, our joint venture with solazyme, inc. to produce renewable oils in brazil. investments in affiliates in 2014 included primarily investments in sb oils.
cash provided by financing activities was $360 million in the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to cash used for financing activities of $1,058 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to net borrowings of debt of $882 million which were used to fund capital expenditures and increased activity in acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates. dividends paid to our common shareholders and holders of our convertible preference shares were $241 million and $221 million, for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. in connection with our common share repurchase program, in 2015 we purchased 3,871,810 of our common shares at a cost of $300 million and in 2014 we purchased 3,780,987 of our common shares at a cost of $300 million. for the year ended december 31, 2014, financing activities reflected reduced financing requirements due to a declining global commodity price environment.
2014 compared to 2013in 2014, our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $380 million reflecting the net effect of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. for the year ended december 31, 2013, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $173 million.
cash provided by our operating activities was $1,399 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $2,225 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. net cash inflows from operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2014 were principally due to net income, including adjustments for non-cash items. the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to lower working capital levels than at december 31, 2013, resulting from on average lower global commodity prices, which effect was partially offset by the impact of the depreciation from certain currencies, including the brazilian real, argentine peso, ukrainian hryvnia and european euro relative to the u.s. dollar. the net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2013 resulted from a combination of net income adjusted for non-cash charges and lower average commodity prices during the year. non-cash charges in 2013 included an income tax valuation allowance of $464 million related to our industrial sugar and bioenergy business in brazil.
certain of our non-u.s. operating subsidiaries are primarily funded with u.s. dollar-denominated debt, while currency risk is hedged with u.s. dollar denominated assets. the functional currency of our operations is generally the local currency. also, certain of our u.s. dollar functional operating subsidiaries outside the united states are partially funded with local currency borrowings, while the currency risk is hedged with local currency denominated assets. the financial statements of our subsidiaries are calculated in the functional currency, and when the local currency is the functional currency translated into u.s. dollar. u.s. dollar-denominated loans are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates at the applicable balance sheet date. local currency loans are remeasured into u.s. dollar at the exchange rate at the applicable balance sheet date. the resulting gain or loss is included in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange gains or losses. for the years ended december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, we recorded foreign exchange gains of $215 million and $48 million, respectively, which were included as adjustments to reconcile net income to cash used for operating activities in the line item "foreign exchange loss (gain) on debt" in our consolidated statements of cash flows. this adjustment is required because the cash flow impacts of these gains or losses are recognized as financing activities when the subsidiary repays the underlying debt and therefore, have no impact on cash flows from operations.
cash used for investing activities was $685 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to cash used of $429 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. during 2014, payments were made for capital expenditures of $839 million, including investments in sugar cane planting and
54
maintenance on mills in our sugar and bioenergy business in brazil, the construction of a port terminal and a wheat milling facility in brazil, construction and expansion of edible oil refining and packaging facilities in the united states and mexico, one of our canola processing facilities in canada and construction of a port facility and oilseed processing plant in ukraine, an oilseed processing plant in asia and a port facility in australia. payments made for capital expenditures in 2014 were lower, compared to $1,042 million in 2013, which was driven by management's reallocation of capital and generally lower capital expenditures in our industrial sugar and bioenergy operations in brazil, as part of the strategic review of these activities. we also acquired a fertilizer plant with port facilities for $24 million in argentina and the assets of a corn flour producer in the united states for $12 million, all amounts net of cash acquired. for the year ended december 31, 2013, cash used for investing activities included cash proceeds of $750 million from the sale of our brazilian fertilizer distribution business to yara, the sale of our 50% ownership interest in our morocco fertilizer business for $37 million and the sale of property from our consolidated investment funds of $48 million. in addition, cash used for investing activities in 2013 included cash payments for the acquisitions of a wheat milling business in mexico for $310 million, a wheat mill in brazil for $35 million and two biodiesel facilities in europe for $11 million, all amounts net of cash acquired. proceeds from and payments for investments for both the years 2014 and 2013 included primarily the sales of assets in funds in our asset management business and the purchases and sales of certain marketable securities and other short-term investments. investments in affiliates in 2014 included primarily an additional investment in sb oils, our joint venture with solazyme, inc. to produce renewable oils in brazil. investments in 2013 included primarily investments in sb oils and a corn wet milling and port facility in argentina.
cash used for financing activities was $1,058 million in the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $1,565 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. for both years, financing activities reflected reduced financing requirements due to a declining global commodity price environment. in connection with our common share repurchase program, in 2014 we purchased 3,780,987 of our common shares resulting in a cash outflow of approximately $300 million. there were no share repurchases in the year ended december 31, 2013.
brazilian farmer credit backgroundwe advance funds to farmers, primarily in brazil, through secured advances to suppliers and prepaid commodity purchase contracts. these activities are generally intended to be short-term in nature. the ability of our customers and suppliers to repay these amounts is affected by agricultural economic conditions in the relevant geography, which are, in turn, affected by commodity prices, currency exchange rates, crop input costs and crop quality and yields. as a result, these arrangements are typically secured by the farmer's crop and, in many cases, the farmer's land and other assets. upon farmer default, we generally initiate legal proceedings to recover the defaulted amounts. however, the legal recovery process through the judicial system is a long-term process, generally spanning a number of years. as a result, once accounts have been submitted to the judicial process for recovery, we may also seek to renegotiate certain terms with the defaulting farmer in order to accelerate recovery of amounts owed. in addition, we have tightened our credit policies to reduce exposure to higher risk accounts and have increased collateral requirements for certain customers.
because brazilian farmer credit exposures are denominated in local currency, reported values are impacted by movements in the value of the brazilian  real when translated into u.s. dollars. from december 31, 2014 to december 31, 2015, the brazilian  real devalued by approximately 47%, decreasing the reported farmer credit exposure balances when translated into u.s. dollars.
we periodically evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts receivable and record allowances if we determine that collection is doubtful. we base our determination of the allowance on analyses of credit quality of individual accounts, considering also the economic and financial condition of the farming industry and other market conditions as well as the value of any collateral related to amounts
55
owed. we continuously review defaulted farmer receivables for impairment on an individual account basis. we consider all accounts in legal collections processes to be defaulted and past due. for such accounts, we determine the allowance for uncollectible amounts based on the fair value of the associated collateral, net of estimated costs to sell. for all renegotiated accounts (current and past due), we consider changes in farm economic conditions and other market conditions, our historical experience related to renegotiated accounts and the fair value of collateral in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts.
secured advances to suppliers and prepaid commodity contractswe purchase soybeans through prepaid commodity purchase contracts (advance cash payments to suppliers against contractual obligations to deliver specified quantities of soybeans in the future) and secured advances to suppliers (advances to suppliers against commitments to deliver soybeans in the future), primarily in brazil. these financing arrangements are typically secured by the farmer's future crop and mortgages on the farmer's land, buildings and equipment, and are generally settled after the farmer's crop is harvested and sold.
interest earned on secured advances to suppliers of $38 million, $37 million and $32 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, is included in net sales in the consolidated statements of income.
the table below shows details of prepaid commodity contracts and secured advances to suppliers outstanding at our brazilian operations as of the dates indicated. see notes 6 and 12 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.

capital expenditures our cash payments made for capital expenditures were $649 million, $839 million and $1,042 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we intend to make capital expenditures of approximately $850 million in 2016. our priorities for 2016 capital expenditures are maintenance, safety and environmental programs first (where we expect to use approximately 40% of our funds allocated to capital expenditures), followed by projects enhancing productivity of our operations, and growth projects. we intend to fund these capital expenditures primarily with cash flows from operations.

off-balance sheet arrangements guarantees we have issued or were party to the following guarantees at december 31, 2015:

unconsolidated affiliates financing(1)       $75
residual value guarantee(2)                  154
total                                        $229
(1)
we issued guarantees to certain financial institutions related to debt of certain of our unconsolidated joint ventures. the terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms of the related financings which have maturity dates in 2016 through 2022. there are no recourse provisions or collateral that would enable us to recover any amounts paid under these guarantees. at december 31, 2015, we had no outstanding recorded obligation related to these guarantees.
(2)
we issued guarantees to certain financial institutions which are party to certain operating lease arrangements for railcars and barges. these guarantees provide for a minimum residual value to be received by the lessor at the conclusion of the lease term. these leases expire at various dates from 2016 through 2020. at december 31, 2015, our recorded obligation related to these guarantees was $5 million.
in addition, bunge limited has provided full and unconditional parent level guarantees of the outstanding indebtedness under certain senior credit facilities and senior notes entered into or issued by its 100% owned subsidiaries. at december 31, 2015, debt with a carrying amount of $4,081 million related to these guarantees is included in our consolidated balance sheet. this debt includes the senior notes issued by two of our 100% owned finance subsidiaries, bunge limited finance corp. and bunge n.a. finance l.p. there are no significant restrictions on the ability of bunge limited finance corp., bunge n.a. finance l.p. or any other of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to bunge limited.

(3)
in the ordinary course of business, we enter into purchase commitments for time on ocean freight vessels and freight service on railroad lines for the purpose of transporting agricultural commodities. in addition, we sell time on these ocean freight vessels when excess freight capacity is available. payments to be received by us under such relet agreements are anticipated to be approximately $6 million in 2016 and $3 million in 2017-2018. these agreements range from two months to approximately seven years in the case of ocean freight vessels and 5 to 17 years in the case of railroad services. actual amounts paid under these contracts may differ due to the variable components of these agreements and the amount of income earned by us on the sale of excess capacity. the railroad freight services agreements require a minimum monthly payment regardless of the actual level of freight services used by us. the costs of our freight supply agreements are typically passed through to our customers as a component of the prices we charge for our products. however, changes in the market value of freight compared to the rates at which we have contracted for freight may affect margins on the sales of agricultural commodities.
(4)
does not include estimated payments of liabilities associated with uncertain income tax positions. as of december 31, 2015, bunge had tax liabilities of $64 million, including interest and penalties. at this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.
(5)
does not include obligations for pension and postretirement benefits for which we expect to make employer contributions of $21 million in 2016. we also expect to make a significant contribution to our plans in future years.
in addition, we have entered into partnership agreements for the production of sugarcane. these agreements have an average remaining life of four years and cover approximately 211,000 hectares of
58
land under cultivation. amounts owed under these agreements are dependent on several variables including the quantity of sugarcane produced per hectare, the total recoverable sugar ("atr") per ton of sugarcane produced and the price for each kilogram of atr as determined by consecana, the são paulo state sugarcane, sugar and ethanol council. during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we made payments related to these agreements of $125 million, $162 million and $169 million, respectively. of these amounts $75 million, $95 million and $107 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were advances for future purchases and $50 million, $67 million and $62 million were included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
employee benefit plans we expect to contribute $15 million to our defined benefit pension plans and $6 million to our postretirement healthcare benefit plans in 2016.
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this annual report on form 10-k.
allowances for uncollectible accounts accounts receivable and secured advances to suppliers are stated at the historical carrying amounts net of write-offs and allowances for uncollectible accounts. we establish an allowance for uncollectible trade accounts receivable and secured advances to farmers based on historical experience, farming, economic and other market conditions as well as specific identified customer collection issues. uncollectible accounts are written off when a settlement is reached for an amount that is less than the outstanding historical balance or when we have determined that collection of the balance is unlikely.
we follow the accounting guidance on the disclosure of the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses which requires information to be disclosed at disaggregated levels, defined as portfolio segments and classes. based upon an analysis of credit losses and risk factors to be considered in determining the allowance for credit losses, we have determined that the long-term receivables from farmers in brazil are a single portfolio segment.
we evaluate this single portfolio segment by class of receivables, which is defined as a level of information (below a portfolio segment) in which the receivables have the same initial measurement attribute and a similar method for assessing and monitoring risk. we have identified accounts in legal collection processes and renegotiated amounts as classes of long-term receivables from farmers. valuation allowances for accounts in legal collection processes are determined by us on individual accounts based on the fair value of the collateral provided as security for the secured advance or credit sale. the fair value is determined using a combination of internal and external resources, including published information concerning brazilian land values by region. for determination of the valuation allowances for renegotiated amounts, we consider historical experience with the individual farmers, current weather and crop conditions, as well as the fair value of non-crop collateral.
for both classes, a long-term receivable from farmers in brazil is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if we determine it to be probable that all amounts due under the original terms of the receivable will not be collected. recognition of interest income on secured advances to farmers is suspended once the farmer defaults on the originally scheduled delivery of agricultural commodities as the collection of future income is determined not to be probable. no
59
additional interest income is accrued from the point of default until ultimate recovery, where amounts collected are credited first against the receivable and then to any unrecognized interest income.
inventories and derivatives we use derivative instruments for the purpose of managing the exposures associated with agricultural commodity prices, transportation costs, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and energy costs and for positioning our overall portfolio relative to expected market movements in accordance with established policies and procedures. we are exposed to loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties to certain of these contracts. the risk of non-performance is routinely monitored and adjustments recorded, if necessary, to account for potential non-performance. different assumptions, changes in economic circumstances or the deterioration of the financial condition of the counterparties to these derivative instruments could result in additional fair value adjustments and increased expense reflected in cost of goods sold, foreign exchange or interest expense. we did not have significant allowances relating to non-performance by counterparties at december 31, 2015 or 2014.
our rmi, forward purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and options are primarily valued at fair value. rmi are freely-traded, have quoted market prices, may be sold without significant additional processing and have predictable and insignificant disposal costs. we estimate fair values of commodity inventories and forward purchase and sale contracts based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets. changes in the fair values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in our consolidated statements of income as a component of cost of goods sold. if we used different methods or factors to estimate fair values, amounts reported as inventories and unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts in the consolidated balance sheets and cost of goods sold could differ. additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year-end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories, unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and cost of goods sold could differ.
recoverable taxes we evaluate the collectability of our recoverable taxes and record valuation allowances if we determine that collection is doubtful. recoverable taxes include value-added paid upon the acquisition of raw materials and taxable services and other transactional taxes which can be recovered in cash or as compensation against income taxes or other taxes we may owe, primarily in brazil. management's assumption about the collectability of recoverable taxes requires significant judgment because it involves an assessment of the ability and willingness of the applicable federal or local government to refund the taxes. the balance of these allowances fluctuates depending on the sales activity of existing inventories, purchases of new inventories, percentages of export sales, seasonality, changes in applicable tax rates, cash payment by the applicable government agencies and compensation of outstanding balances against income or certain other taxes owed to the applicable governments. at december 31, 2015 and 2014, the allowance for recoverable taxes was $32 million and $43 million, respectively. we continue to monitor the economic environment and events taking place in the applicable countries and in cases where we determine that recovery is doubtful, recoverable taxes are reduced by allowances for the estimated unrecoverable amounts.
property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets. when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of property, plant and equipment assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the projected future cash flows to be generated by such assets. if it appears that the carrying value of our assets is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss as a charge against results of
60
operations. our judgments related to the expected useful lives of property, plant and equipment assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amount of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our property, plant and equipment assets, changes in these factors could cause us to realize material impairment charges. we recorded impairment charges of $17 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily related to the announced closure of a packaged oil plant in the u.s.
contingencies we are a party to a large number of claims and lawsuits, primarily tax and labor claims in brazil and tax claims in argentina, and have accrued our estimates of the probable costs to resolve these claims. these estimates have been developed in consultation with in-house and outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings. for more information on tax and labor claims in brazil, see "item 3. legal proceedings."
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we are likely to realize. we consider projections of future taxable income and prudent tax planning strategies to assess the need for and the size of the valuation allowances. if we determine that we can realize a deferred tax asset in excess of our net recorded amount, we decrease the valuation allowance, thereby decreasing income tax expense. conversely, if we determine that we are unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset, we increase the valuation allowance, thereby increasing income tax expense.
we apply a "more likely than not" threshold to the recognition and de-recognition of tax benefits. accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. the calculation of our uncertain tax positions involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. future changes in judgment related to the ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect the earnings in the quarter of such change. at december 31, 2015 and 2014, we had recorded uncertain tax positions of $64 million and $83 million, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets. for additional information on income taxes, please refer to note 14 of the consolidated financial statements.

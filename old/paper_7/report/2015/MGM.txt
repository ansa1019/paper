item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

executive overview our primary business is the ownership and operation of casino resorts, which offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort amenities. we own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. most of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development and repay debt financings.  we make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features and amenities.
according to the las vegas convention and visitors authority, las vegas visitor volume increased 3%, las vegas strip revpar increased 3% and las vegas strip gaming revenue decreased less than 1% in the year ended december 31, 2015. results of operations for our wholly owned domestic resorts during 2015 benefited from an increase in operating margins resulting from increases in gaming revenue and revpar. our rooms revenue benefited from increased visitation to the las vegas market and robust convention business at our las vegas strip resorts, which resulted in increases in occupancy and allowed us to yield higher room rates across our portfolio of resorts.
gross gaming revenues in the macau market decreased 34% in 2015 compared to 2014.  we believe operating results have been negatively affected by economic conditions and certain policy initiatives in china and the implementation of a full main floor casino smoking ban in october 2014. additionally, we believe stricter enforcement of entrance into macau via the use of transit visas, as well as a decrease in duration of stay permitted for transit visa holders, has negatively affected operating results; however, restrictions surrounding the use of transit visas were eased in july 2015. the decrease in gross gaming revenues accelerated during the second half of 2014 and continued throughout 2015 as macau has become an increasingly challenging and competitive market, impacting primarily vip casino gaming operations and, to a lesser extent, main floor operations. according to statistics published by the statistics and census service of the macau government, visitor arrivals decreased 3% in 2015 compared to 2014. despite concerns over the recent events and the sustainability of economic growth in china, we expect the macau market to grow on a long-term basis due to further development and penetration of the mainland china market and infrastructure improvements expected to facilitate more convenient travel to and within macau.
our results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation, our access to capital and our cost of capital.  while we continue to be focused on improving our financial position, we are also dedicated to capitalizing on development opportunities. in macau, we plan to spend approximately $3.0 billion, excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation, capitalized interest and land related costs, to develop mgm cotai, a resort and casino with capacity for up to 500 gaming tables and up to 1,500 slots, and featuring approximately 1,500 hotel rooms, built on an approximately 18 acre site on the cotai strip in macau.  the actual number of gaming tables allocated to mgm cotai will be determined by the macau government prior to opening, and such allocation may be less than our 500 gaming table capacity.   mgm cotai is expected to open at the end of the first quarter of 2017.
we were awarded the sixth and final casino license under current statutes in the state of maryland by the maryland video lottery facility location commission to build and operate mgm national harbor, a destination casino resort in prince george's county at national harbor, which is a waterfront development located on the potomac river just outside of washington, d.c. we currently expect the cost to develop and construct mgm national harbor to be approximately $1.3 billion, excluding capitalized interest and land related costs. we designed the resort to include a casino with approximately 3,600 slots and 160 table games including poker; a 300-room hotel with luxury spa and rooftop pool; 93,100 square feet of high-end branded retail and fine and casual dining; a 3,000-seat theater venue; 50,000 square feet of meeting and event space; and a 4,700-space parking garage. we expect mgm national harbor to open in the fourth quarter of 2016.
we were awarded a casino license to build and operate mgm springfield in springfield, massachusetts. mgm springfield will be developed on approximately 14 acres of land in downtown springfield, massachusetts. mgm's plans for the resort currently include a casino with approximately 3,000 slots and 100 table games including poker; a 250-room hotel; 100,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space; 44,000 square feet of meeting and event space; and a 3,375-space parking garage; with an expected development and construction cost of approximately $865 million, excluding capitalized interest and land-related costs. construction of mgm springfield is expected to be completed in late 2018.
we entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of anschutz entertainment group, inc. ("aeg") to design, construct, and operate an arena, which will be located on a parcel of our land between frank sinatra drive and new york-new york, adjacent to the las vegas strip. we and aeg each own 50% of las vegas arena company, the developer of the arena. in september 2014, a wholly
30
owned subsidiary of las vegas arena company entered into a $200 million senior secured credit facility to finance construction of the arena. the las vegas arena company recently entered into a multi-year naming rights agreement with t-mobile. t-mobile arena will seat between 18,000 and 20,000 people and is scheduled to open in the april 2016. such development is estimated to cost approximately $350 million, excluding capitalized interest and land-related costs. in addition, we are building the park entertainment district which connects to new york-new york, monte carlo and t-mobile arena.
in august 2015, we announced the implementation of a profit growth plan for sustained growth and margin enhancement. the profit growth plan's initiatives are focused on improving business processes to optimize our scale for greater efficiency and lower cost throughout our business, and to identify areas of opportunity to organically drive incremental revenue growth. the profit growth plan includes a large number of opportunities to enhance our business operations and we continue to explore additional opportunities to drive further margin enhancements. the plan is expected to result in approximately $300 million of annualized adjusted ebitda benefit. the profit growth plan has begun to show significant results and is expected to be fully realized by the end of 2017.
on october 29, 2015, we announced the formation of mgp as a newly formed subsidiary that we expect to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("reit") for u.s. federal income tax purposes. we intend to contribute to a newly-formed operating partnership that mgp will control through a general partner subsidiary the real estate associated with mandalay bay, the mirage, new york-new york, luxor, monte carlo, excalibur, the park, mgm grand detroit, beau rivage and gold strike tunica (collectively, the "properties"). we also intend to incur approximately $4 billion of debt to refinance a portion of the debt outstanding under our existing senior credit facility and senior notes, which refinancing debt would be assumed by the operating partnership in connection with the reit transactions. one of our subsidiaries will then lease the properties from mgp for use under a long-term, "triple net" master lease agreement with a 10-year term that includes four five-year extensions at our option. we will guarantee our subsidiary's obligations under the master lease. we expect to retain through subsidiaries an approximate 70% economic interest in the new operating partnership, as well as voting control of mgp through our ownership of a controlling share in mgp.
reportable segments we have two reportable segments that are based on the regions in which we operate: wholly owned domestic resorts and mgm china. we currently operate 12 wholly owned resorts in the united states. mgm china's operations consist of mgm macau resort and the development of mgm cotai on the cotai strip in macau. we have additional business activities including investments in unconsolidated affiliates, our mgm hospitality operations and certain other corporate and management operations. citycenter is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate, which we also manage for a fee.  our operations that are not segregated into separate reportable segments are reported as "corporate and other" operations in our reconciliations of segment results to consolidated results.
wholly owned domestic resorts. at december 31, 2015, our wholly owned domestic resorts consisted of the following casino resorts:
las vegas, nevada:   bellagio, mgm grand las vegas (including the signature), mandalay bay (including delano and four seasons), the mirage, luxor, new york-new york, excalibur, monte carlo and circus circus las vegas.

other:               mgm grand detroit in detroit, michigan; beau rivage in biloxi, mississippi; gold strike tunica in tunica, mississippi.
over half of the net revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts is derived from non-gaming operations including hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and other non-gaming amenities. we market to different customer groups and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during off-peak times such as mid-week or during traditionally slower leisure travel periods, which also leads to better labor utilization.  our operating results are highly dependent on demand for our services, and the volume of customers at our resorts, which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities.  also, we generate a significant portion of our revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts in las vegas, nevada, which exposes us to certain risks, such as increased competition from new or expanded las vegas resorts, and from the expansion of gaming in the united states generally.
key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue at our wholly owned domestic resorts are:
·   gaming revenue indicators: table games drop and slots handle (volume indicators); "win" or "hold" percentage, which is not fully controllable by us. our normal table games hold percentage is in the range of 18% to 22% of table games drop and our normal slots hold percentage is approximately 8.5% of slots handle; and

31
·   hotel revenue indicators: hotel occupancy (a volume indicator); average daily rate ("adr," a price indicator); and revenue per available room ("revpar," a summary measure of hotel results, combining adr and occupancy rate). our calculation of adr, which is the average price of occupied rooms per day, includes the impact of complimentary rooms. complimentary room rates are determined based on an analysis of retail or "cash" rates for each customer segment and each type of room product to estimate complimentary rates which are consistent with retail rates. complimentary rates are reviewed at least annually and on an interim basis if there are significant changes in market conditions. because the mix of rooms provided on a complimentary basis, particularly to casino customers, includes a disproportionate suite component, the composite adr including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the adr for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites.

mgm china. we own a 51% controlling interest in mgm china, which owns mgm grand paradise, the macau company that owns and operates mgm macau and the related gaming subconcession and land concessions, and is in the process of developing mgm cotai, an integrated casino, hotel, and entertainment resort on the cotai strip in macau.  we believe our investment in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability.
revenues at mgm macau are generated from three primary customer segments in the macau gaming market: vip casino gaming operations, main floor gaming operations, and slot machine operations. vip players play mostly in dedicated vip rooms or designated gaming areas. vip customers can be further divided into customers sourced by in-house vip programs and those sourced through gaming promoters. a significant portion of our vip volume is generated through the use of gaming promoters. gaming promoters introduce vip gaming players to mgm macau, assist these customers with travel arrangements, and extend gaming credit to these players. in exchange for their services, gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenue-sharing arrangements or rolling chip turnover based commissions.  in-house vip players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate.  mgm macau main floor operations primarily consist of walk-in and day trip visitors. unlike gaming promoters and in-house vip players, main floor players do not receive commissions.  the profit contribution from the main floor segment exceeds the vip segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters. gaming revenues from the main floor segment have become an increasingly significant portion of total gaming revenues in recent years and we believe this segment represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future.
vip gaming at mgm macau is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips. gaming promoters purchase these nonnegotiable chips from mgm macau and in turn they sell these chips to their players. the nonnegotiable chips allow mgm macau to track the amount of wagering conducted by each gaming promoters' clients in order to determine vip gaming play.  gaming promoter commissions are based on either a percentage of actual win plus a monthly complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the rolling chip turnover their customers generate, or a percentage of the rolling chip turnover plus discounted offerings on nongaming amenities. the estimated portion of the gaming promoter payments that represent amounts passed through to vip customers is recorded as a reduction of casino revenue, and the estimated portion retained by the gaming promoter for its compensation is recorded as casino expense.  in-house vip commissions are based on a percentage of rolling chip turnover and are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue.
in addition to the key performance indicators used by our wholly owned domestic resorts, mgm macau utilizes "turnover," which is the sum of nonnegotiable chip wagers won by mgm macau calculated as nonnegotiable chips purchased plus nonnegotiable chips exchanged less nonnegotiable chips returned. turnover provides a basis for measuring vip casino win percentage.  win for vip gaming operations at mgm macau is typically in the range of 2.7% to 3.0% of turnover.
corporate and other. corporate and other includes our investments in unconsolidated affiliates and certain management and other operations.  see note 1 and note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the company's unconsolidated affiliates.
results of operations the following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

summary operating results the following table summarizes our operating results:
year ended december 31,

net revenues                  $9,190,068                   $10,081,984                   $9,809,663
operating income (loss)               (156,232   )                 1,323,538                     1,137,281
consolidated net revenues for 2015 decreased 9% compared to 2014 due primarily to a decrease in casino revenue at mgm china, offset by increases in casino and non-casino revenue at our wholly owned domestic resorts. consolidated net revenues for 2014 increased 3% compared to 2013 due primarily to increased casino and non-casino revenue at our wholly owned domestic resorts.
consolidated operating loss of $156 million in 2015 was negatively affected by an operating loss for mgm china that included a $1.5 billion non-cash impairment charge to goodwill recognized in the acquisition of a controlling interest in mgm china. we recorded a $3.5 billion non-cash gain in 2011 in connection with that acquisition. the current impairment charge, which represents approximately 42% of the amount of the previously recognized gain, resulted from our annual review of our goodwill carrying values and was incurred as a result of reduced cash flow forecasts for mgm china's resorts based on current market conditions and lower valuation multiples for gaming assets in the macau market. in addition, the operating loss was affected by a decrease in operating results at mgm macau. the operating loss for mgm china was partially offset by an increase in operating income at our wholly owned domestic resorts and an increase in income from unconsolidated affiliates, primarily from citycenter, which included $80 million related to our share of the gain recognized by citycenter as a result of the final resolution of its construction litigation and related settlements. in addition, corporate expense increased 15% to $275 million in 2015, due primarily to costs incurred to implement initiatives in relation to the profit growth plan of $24 million and costs associated with our proposed reit transaction of $20 million. preopening expense primarily related to our ongoing mgm cotai, mgm springfield and mgm national harbor development projects increased to $71 million in 2015 compared to $39 million in 2014. consolidated operating loss in 2015 was also negatively affected by impairment charges and losses on disposal of certain assets, in addition to the mgm china goodwill impairment charge discussed above, recorded in "property transactions, net." see "operating results - details of certain charges" below for additional detail on our preopening expense and property transactions.
consolidated operating income of $1.3 billion in 2014 benefited from an increase in revenue at our wholly owned domestic resorts and an increase in main floor table games revenue at mgm china, as well as a decrease in property transactions, net to $41 million in 2014 compared to $125 million in 2013.  in addition, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $33 million in 2014 compared to 2013, due primarily to certain assets at our wholly owned resorts and mgm china becoming fully depreciated and a decrease in amortization expense for intangible assets.  operating income was negatively affected by increases in general and administrative expense, corporate expense and preopening expense. general and administrative expense increased primarily related to an increase in payroll and related expense. corporate expense increased 10% in 2014, due primarily to an increase in payroll costs and professional fees partially offset by a decrease in development related costs. preopening expense increased to $39 million in 2014, compared to $13 million in 2013, primarily as a result of the commencement of development on mgm springfield and mgm national harbor.

our effective tax rate in 2015 was impacted by the non-cash impairment charge on mgm china goodwill for which we did not record income tax benefit.  our effective tax rate decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of providing greater tax benefit in 2015 than in 2014 for foreign tax credits, net of valuation allowance, partially offset by tax benefit resulting from audit settlements in 2014. our effective tax rate increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the reduced tax benefit in 2014 for foreign tax credits, net of valuation allowance, partially offset by tax provision in 2013 resulting from re-measuring the macau net deferred tax liability due to the extension of the amortization period of the mgm china gaming subconcession upon effectiveness of the cotai land concession.
cash taxes paid decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of a $16 million refund of taxes and associated interest received in 2015 on the closure of the irs examination of citycenter, which is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes which partially offset federal income tax estimated tax payments of $23 million made during the year.  the remaining $5
38
million of cash taxes paid in 2015 consist of state and foreign income taxes. cash taxes paid increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of $30 million paid to irs for the closure of examinations covering the 2005 through 2009 tax years and $8 million estimated taxes paid to the irs during 2014.  the remaining $4 million of cash taxes paid in 2014 consist of state and foreign income taxes. cash taxes paid in 2013 consisted primarily of foreign and state taxes.
non-gaap measures
"adjusted ebitda" is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, and property transactions, net. "adjusted property ebitda" is adjusted ebitda before corporate expense and stock compensation expense related to the mgm resorts stock option plan, which is not allocated to each reportable segment or operating segment, as applicable. mgm china recognizes stock compensation expense related to its stock compensation plan which is included in the calculation of adjusted ebitda for mgm china. adjusted ebitda and adjusted property ebitda information is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported gaap measures because management believes these measures are 1) widely used measures of operating performance in the gaming and hospitality industry, and 2) a principal basis for valuation of gaming and hospitality companies.
we believe that while items excluded from adjusted ebitda and adjusted property ebitda may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented. also, we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results. for example, preopening and start-up expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be comparable period over period. in addition, capital allocation, tax planning, financing and stock compensation awards are all managed at the corporate level. therefore, we use adjusted property ebitda as the primary measure of wholly owned domestic resorts operating performance.
adjusted ebitda or adjusted property ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or net income, as an indicator of our performance; or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity; or as any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. we have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in adjusted ebitda or adjusted property ebitda. also, other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report adjusted ebitda or adjusted property ebitda information may calculate adjusted ebitda or adjusted property ebitda in a different manner.

other factors affecting liquidity anticipated uses of cash. we have significant outstanding debt and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures. at december 31, 2015, we had $1.5 billion of principal amount of long-term debt maturing in 2016, primarily related to our $242.9 million 6.875% senior notes, $732.7 million 7.5% senior notes, and $500 million 10% senior notes, and an estimated $750 million of cash interest payments based on current outstanding debt and applicable interest rates, within the next twelve months.
we expect to make the following capital investments, excluding capitalized interest, during 2016:
·   approximately $440 million in capital expenditures at our wholly owned domestic resorts and corporate entities, which includes expenditures on the park, the monte carlo theatre, the new excalibur parking garage, and replacement of aircraft;

·   approximately $130 million in capital expenditures related to the mgm springfield project; and

·   approximately $680 million in capital expenditures related to the mgm national harbor project.

during 2016, mgm china expects to spend approximately $50 million in capital improvements at mgm macau and $1.6 billion on the mgm cotai project, excluding capitalized interest, development fees and land related costs.
our capital expenditures fluctuate depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing resorts and the timing of capital investments to maintain the quality of our resorts, the amounts of which can vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms. future capital expenditures could vary from our current expectations depending on the progress of our development efforts and the structure of our ownership interests in future developments.
cotai land concession.  mgm grand paradise's land concession contract for an approximate 18 acre site in cotai, macau became effective on january 9, 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years. the total land premium payable to the macau government for the land concession contract is $161 million and is composed of a down payment and eight additional semi-annual payments. as of december 31, 2015, mgm china had paid $130 million of the contract premium, including interest due on the semi-annual payments. in january 2016, mgm china paid the sixth semi-annual payment of $15 million under the land concession contract. including interest on the two remaining semi-annual payments, mgm china has $29 million remaining payable for the land concession contract.
mgm china dividend.  on february 18, 2016, as part of its regular dividend policy, mgm china's board of directors announced it will recommend a final dividend for 2015 of $46 million to mgm china shareholders subject to approval at the mgm china 2016 annual shareholders meeting to be held in may.  if approved, we will receive $23 million, our 51% share of the 2015 final dividend.
reit transaction. in connection with the proposed reit transaction, we expect to incur approximately $4 billion of debt to refinance a portion of the debt outstanding under our existing senior credit facility and certain of our senior notes, which refinancing debt will be assumed by the operating partnership and repaid with the equity proceeds from the contemplated ipo and concurrent debt financings.
principal debt arrangements our long-term debt consists of publicly held senior notes and our senior credit facility.  at december 31, 2015, excluding mgm china, we had $11.3 billion principal amount of indebtedness, including $2.7 billion of borrowings outstanding under our $3.9 billion senior credit facility. we pay fixed rates of interest ranging from 5.25% to 11.375% on our senior notes.  our senior credit facility consists of a $1.2 billion revolving loan facility, a $1.02 billion term loan a facility and a $1.70 billion term loan b facility.  the revolving and term loan a facilities bear interest at libor plus an applicable rate determined by our credit rating (2.75% as of december 31, 2015).  the term loan b facility bears interest at libor plus 2.50% with a libor floor of 1.00%.  the revolving and term loan a facilities mature in december 2017. the term loan b facility matures in december 2019.  the term loan a and term loan b facilities are subject to scheduled amortization payments on the last day of each calendar quarter in an amount equal to 0.25% of the original principal balance.  we had approximately $1.2 billion of available borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility at december 31, 2015. at december 31, 2015, the interest rate on the term loan a was 3.17% and the interest rate on the term loan b was 3.50%.
44
the land and substantially all of the assets of mgm grand las vegas, bellagio and the mirage secure up to $3.35 billion of obligations outstanding under the senior credit facility.  in addition, the land and substantially all of the assets of new york-new york and gold strike tunica secure the entire amount of the senior credit facility, and the land and substantially all of the assets of mgm grand detroit secure its $450 million of obligations as a co-borrower under the senior credit facility. in addition, the senior credit facility is secured by a pledge of the equity or limited liability company interests of the subsidiaries that own the pledged properties.
the senior credit facility contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants. in addition, the senior credit facility requires us and our restricted subsidiaries (the "restricted group") to maintain a minimum trailing four-quarter ebitda and limits the ability of the restricted group to make capital expenditures and investments. as of december 31, 2015, the restricted group is required to maintain a minimum ebitda (as defined) of $1.30 billion.  the minimum ebitda increases to $1.35 billion for march 31, 2016 through december 31, 2016, and to $1.40 billion for march 31, 2017 and thereafter.  ebitda for the trailing four quarters ended december 31, 2015 calculated in accordance with the terms of the senior credit facility was $1.71 billion.  in accordance with our senior credit facility covenants, the restricted group is limited to annual capital expenditures of $500 million in each year beginning with 2013 with unused amounts in any fiscal year rolling over to the next fiscal year, but not any fiscal year thereafter. our total restricted group capital expenditures allowable under the senior credit facility for 2015, after giving effect to the unused amount from 2014, was $794 million. in addition, our senior credit facility limits the restricted group's ability to make investments subject to certain thresholds and other important exceptions. the restricted group was within the limit of capital expenditures and other investments for 2015. we believe we have sufficient capacity under these thresholds to fund our planned development activity.
the senior credit facility provides for customary events of default, including, without limitation, (i) payment defaults, (ii) covenant defaults, (iii) cross-defaults to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, (iv) certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, (v) judgment defaults in excess of specified amounts, (vi) the failure of any loan document by a significant party to be in full force and effect and such circumstance, in the reasonable judgment of the required lenders, is materially adverse to the lenders, or (vii) the security documents cease to create a valid and perfected first priority lien on any material portion of the collateral. in addition, the senior credit facility provides that a cessation of business due to revocation, suspension or loss of any gaming license affecting a specified amount of its revenues or assets, will constitute an event of default.
all of our principal debt arrangements are guaranteed by each of our material domestic subsidiaries, other than mgm grand detroit, llc (which is a co-borrower under our senior credit facility), mgm national harbor, llc and blue tarp redevelopment, llc (the company that will own and operate our proposed casino in springfield, massachusetts), and each of their respective subsidiaries. our international subsidiaries, including mgm china and its subsidiaries, are not guarantors of such indebtedness. we and our subsidiaries may from time to time, in our sole discretion, purchase, repay, redeem or retire any of our outstanding debt securities, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise pursuant to authorization of our board of directors and in accordance with the terms of our senior credit facilities.
in june 2015, mgm china and mgm grand paradise, as co-borrowers, entered into a second amended and restated credit facility which consists of $1.55 billion of term loans and a $1.45 billion revolving credit facility. the outstanding balance at december 31, 2015 of $1.6 billion was comprised solely of term loans. the interest rate on the facility fluctuates annually based on hibor plus a margin that will range between 1.375% and 2.50% based on mgm china's leverage ratio. the mgm china credit facility is secured by mgm grand paradise's interest in the cotai land use right, and mgm china, mgm grand paradise and their guarantor subsidiaries have granted a security interest in substantially all of their assets to secure the facility. the credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes and for the development of the cotai project.
the mgm china credit facility contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, affirmative covenants and negative covenants, which impose restrictions on, among other things, the ability of mgm china and its subsidiaries to make investments, pay dividends and sell assets, and to incur additional liens. as of december 31, 2015, mgm china was required to maintain compliance with a maximum leverage ratio of 4.50 to 1.00 in addition to a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.50 to 1.00.  mgm china was in compliance with the credit facility covenants at december 31, 2015.
in february 2016, the mgm china credit facility was amended to increase the maximum consolidated total leverage ratio. the maximum total leverage ratio increases to 6.00 to 1.00 for september 30, 2016 through june 30, 2017, and then decreases to 5.50 to 1.00 for september 30, 2017, 5.00 to 1.00 for december 31, 2017, and 4.50 to 1.00 for march 31, 2018 and thereafter.
in january 2016, mgm national harbor, llc, the company's wholly owned subsidiary developing and constructing mgm national harbor, entered into a $100 million revolving credit facility and a $425 million delayed draw term loan facility, of which $250 million was funded at closing. the revolving and term loan facilities will initially bear interest at a libor rate plus an additional rate ranging from 2.00% to 2.25% per annum (determined based on a total leverage ratio). the term loan is subject to
45
scheduled amortization payments on the last day of each calendar quarter beginning the fourth full fiscal quarter following the opening of mgm national harbor, initially in an amount equal to 1.25% of the aggregate principal balance and increasing to 1.875% and 2.50% of the aggregate principal balance on the last day of the twelfth and sixteenth full fiscal quarters, respectively. the term loan and revolving facilities are scheduled to mature in january 2021.
the credit agreement is secured by a leasehold mortgage on mgm national harbor and substantially all of the existing and future property of mgm national harbor. mandatory prepayments will be required upon the occurrence of certain events, including sales of certain assets, casualty events and the incurrence of certain additional indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights. in addition, to the extent mgm national harbor generates excess cash flow (as defined in the credit agreement), a percentage of such excess cash flow (ranging from 0% to 50% based on a total leverage ratio) will be required to be used to prepay the term loan facilities commencing with the fiscal year ended 2017.
the credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, affirmative covenants and negative covenants, which impose restrictions on, among other things, the ability of mgm national harbor, llc and its restricted subsidiaries to make investments, pay dividends, sell assets, and to incur additional debt and additional liens. in addition, the credit agreement requires mgm national harbor, llc and its restricted subsidiaries to maintain a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. in addition, borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to a customary "in balance test" (as defined in the credit agreement), which looks to the sufficiency of mgm national harbor, llc's available resources to complete the mgm national harbor casino resort.
off balance sheet arrangements our off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which consist primarily of our investments in citycenter, grand victoria, borgata, and t-mobile arena.  we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities, nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions.  our unconsolidated affiliate investments allow us to realize the proportionate benefits of owning a full-scale resort in a manner that minimizes our initial investment.  other than the t-mobile arena guarantee described below, we have not historically guaranteed financings obtained by our investees. in addition, there are no other provisions in the agreements with our investees which we believe are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the resort.
in conjunction with the las vegas arena company entering into a senior secured credit facility in september 2014, we and aeg each entered into joint and several completion guarantees for the project, as well as a repayment guarantee for the term loan b (which is subject to increases and decreases in the event of a rebalancing of the principal amount of indebtedness between the term loan a and term loan b facilities).   as of december 31, 2015, term loan a was $120 million and term loan b was $80 million.
commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual obligations as of december 31, 2015:
2016               2017               2018               2019               2020               thereafter

(1)   estimated interest payments are based on principal amounts and expected maturities of debt outstanding at december 31, 2015 and management's forecasted libor rates for our senior credit facility and hibor rates for the mgm china credit facility.

(2)   the amount for 2016 includes $640 million related to mgm cotai and $261 million and $15 million related to mgm national harbor and mgm springfield, respectively.

(3)   mgm national harbor is being built on land subject to a long-term ground lease. see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

(4)   approximately $4 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and other tax liabilities are excluded from the table as we cannot reasonably estimate when examination and other activity related to these amounts will conclude or when these amounts will be paid, if ever.

46
(5)   the amount for 2016 includes $118 million related to employment agreements, $105 million for entertainment agreements and $77 million of open purchase orders. other commitments include various contracted amounts, including information technology, advertising, maintenance and other service agreements. our largest entertainment commitments consist of minimum contractual payments to cirque du soleil, which performs shows at several of our resorts. our contractual commitments for these shows generally do not exceed 12 months and are based on our ability to exercise certain termination rights; however, we expect these shows to continue for longer periods.

while we have significant indebtedness, we believe we have the ability to meet known obligations, including principal and interest obligations as well as planned capital expenditures over the next twelve months from the balance sheet date with existing cash and cash deposits, cash flows from operations, dividends from mgm china, and availability under our senior credit facility, the mgm china credit agreement and the mgm national harbor credit agreement.  we have $1.5 billion of maturities of long-term debt in 2016.  see "liquidity and capital resources - other factors affecting liquidity" for further discussion of anticipated uses of cash.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements.  to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements.  we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions, particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates, where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates, and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates.  however, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates.
allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our las vegas resorts.  in addition, mgm china extends credit to certain in-house vip gaming customers and gaming promoters.  our other casinos do not emphasize marker play to the same extent, although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well. we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our other customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely. these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts, including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation. markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states and macau. at december 31, 2015 and 2014, approximately 37% and 30%, respectively, of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the united states. markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states. at december 31, 2015 and 2014, approximately 44% and 54%, respectively, of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the far east. we consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when we issue credit to customers who are not residents of the united states.
we maintain an allowance, or reserve, for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts.  the provision for doubtful accounts, an operating expense, increases the allowance for doubtful accounts.  we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts.  at resorts where marker play is not significant, the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances.  at resorts where marker play is significant, we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount, based on the age of the account, the customer's financial condition, collection history and any other known information.
in addition to enforceability issues, the collectability of unpaid markers given by foreign customers is affected by a number of factors, including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers' home countries.  because individual customer account balances can be significant, the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods, as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region's economy occur.

approximately $40 million and $68 million of casino receivables and $9 million and $13 million of the allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable relate to mgm china at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable has increased in the current year due to an increase in specific reserves for high-end gaming customers and an increase in the aging of accounts.  at december 31, 2015, a 100 basis-point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income before income taxes by $2.9 million.
fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies property and equipment are stated at cost.  for the majority of our property and equipment, cost was determined at the acquisition date based on estimated fair values in connection with the june 2011 mgm china acquisition, the april 2005 mandalay acquisition and the may 2000 mirage resorts acquisition.  maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred.  depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  when we construct assets, we capitalize direct costs of the project, including fees paid to architects and contractors, property taxes, and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries. in addition, interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project.  interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted-average cost of our outstanding borrowings.  capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.
we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures.  whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment.  when constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired, which also may be a matter of judgment.  in addition, our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets' estimated useful lives.  we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage of the asset.  whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively.
impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets we evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on our classification as held for sale or to be held and used.  several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. for assets classified as held for sale, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model.  for assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.  we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset.  if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated.  if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset.  for operating assets, fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital, developed using a standard capital asset pricing model, based on guideline companies in our industry. if an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs.  all recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.
there are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of long-lived assets.  first, management must determine the usage of the asset.  to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold, it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized.  assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist.  this means that some assets must be grouped, and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets.  future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates.
48
on a quarterly basis, we review our major long-lived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment.  potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results, negative industry or economic factors, significant changes to our operating environment, or changes in intended use of the asset group.  we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group, including potential sale. historically, undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin.
we review indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. we perform our annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights, which are tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach, and trademarks, which are tested for impairment using the relief-from-royalty method.  see note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets.
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations.  goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on our budgeted future results discounted using a weighted average cost of capital, developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry, and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, as well as a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples in our peer group.  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an indication of impairment exists and we must proceed to measure an impairment loss, if any. in measuring an impairment loss, the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities and the amount remaining, if any, is the implied fair value of goodwill. if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value then it must be written down to its implied fair value.
due to a significant decrease in mgm china's cash flows as well as a decline in the market capitalization of mgm china relative to its net book value, we performed an interim impairment test of goodwill related to the mgm china reporting unit in the second quarter of 2015. as of the date we completed our 2015 interim goodwill impairment analysis, the estimated fair value of our mgm china reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 9%. we therefore concluded that goodwill related to the mgm china reporting unit was not impaired. during the fourth quarter of 2015, we conducted our annual impairment tests of goodwill by reviewing each of our reporting units, including our mgm china reporting unit. the step one goodwill analysis of the mgm china reporting unit indicated the fair value was less than its carrying value by 4%. the decrease in fair value from the interim test valuation date resulted from a further decrease in forecasted cash flows from our interim analysis based on current market conditions and a further sustained decline in the enterprise value multiples of the mgm china reporting unit as well as those of the mgm china reporting unit's peer group. as a result of the indication of impairment from the step one analysis, we proceeded to perform a step two impairment analysis to measure the impairment loss. as such, we determined the current fair values of all assets of the mgm china reporting unit, including its separately identifiable intangible assets. the current fair values of each of the separately identifiable intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values by a significant amount, leading to a lower implied fair value of goodwill. therefore, we recorded a $1.5 billion non-cash impairment charge to reduce the historical carrying value of goodwill related to the mgm china reporting unit to its implied fair value.
with the exception of our mgm china reporting unit, as discussed above, none of our other reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2015, 2014 or 2013. as of the date we completed our 2015 goodwill impairment analysis, the estimated fair values of our wholly owned domestic resorts reporting units with associated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying values.  as discussed below, management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses. if future operating results of our reporting units do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge.
there are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment.  in particular, future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates.  in addition, the determination of multiples, capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions.
see notes 7 and 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of write downs and impairments of goodwill and long-lived assets.
impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investment may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. if such conditions exist, we
49
compare the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to determine whether an impairment is indicated and determine whether the impairment is other-than-temporary based on our assessment of relevant factors, including consideration of our intent and ability to retain our investment. we estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimates of future cash flows and market indicators of discount rates and terminal year capitalization rates, as well as a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples in our peer group.  see note 6 and note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of other-than-temporary impairment charges.
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences with a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not.  otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied. as of december 31, 2015, the scheduled future reversal of existing u.s. federal taxable temporary differences exceeds the scheduled future reversal of existing u.s. federal deductible temporary differences.  consequently, we no longer apply a valuation allowance against our u.s. federal deferred tax assets other than our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset and a capital loss carryforward.
as of december 31, 2015, we have a foreign tax credit carryover of $2.9 billion against which we have recorded a valuation allowance of $2.7 billion based upon our assessment of future realization.  the foreign tax credits are attributable to the macau special gaming tax which is 35% of gross gaming revenue in macau.  because mgm china is presently exempt from the macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits, we believe that payment of the macau special gaming tax qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax that is creditable against u.s. taxes. although mgm china's current five-year exemption from the macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits ends on december 31, 2016, we believe it will be entitled to receive a third five-year exemption from macau based upon exemptions granted to its competitors in order to ensure non-discriminatory treatment among gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires.  for all periods beyond december 31, 2021, we have assumed that mgm china will be paying the macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits and will thus not be able to credit the macau special gaming tax in such years and have factored that assumption into our assessment of the realization of the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset.  furthermore, we do not rely on future u.s. source operating income in assessing future foreign tax credit realization due to our history of recent losses in the u.s. and therefore only rely on u.s. federal taxable temporary differences that we expect will reverse during the 10-year foreign tax credit carryover period.
our assessment of realization of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is based on available evidence, including assumptions about future profitability of and distributions from mgm china, our assumption concerning renewals of the five year exemption from macau's 12% complementary tax on gaming profits and assumptions concerning future u.s. operating profits.  as a result, significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a valuation allowance and changes to our assumptions may have a material impact on the amount of the valuation allowance.  for example, should we in a future period actually receive or be able to assume an additional five year exemption, an additional valuation allowance would likely need to be provided on some portion or all of the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset, resulting in an increase in the provision for income taxes in such period and such increase may be material.  in addition, a change to our forecasts of future profitability of and distributions from mgm china could also result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes in such period.
finally, we do not currently rely on future u.s. source operating income in assessing future foreign tax credit realization due to our recent history of cumulative losses in the u.s. and therefore only rely on u.s. federal taxable temporary differences that we expect will reverse during the 10-year foreign tax credit carryover period. however, due to improvements in our u.s. operations we have generated u.s. operating profits for the past four consecutive quarters.  should these profits continue in future periods, we may during the next 12 months begin to utilize projections of future u.s. source operating income in our assessment of the realizability of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset, which could result in a reduction in the valuation allowance and a corresponding reduction in the provision for income taxes in such period.  however, the exact timing and amount of reduction in the valuation allowance are subject to change on the basis of the level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve.
in addition, there is an $18 million valuation allowance, after federal effect, provided on certain state deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance of $3 million on a federal income tax capital loss carryforward, a valuation allowance of $69 million on certain macau deferred tax assets, and a valuation allowance of $1 million on hong kong net operating losses because we believe these assets do not meet the "more likely than not" criteria for recognition.
we file income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the income taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material.  our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service ("irs") and other tax authorities.  positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the irs or other tax authorities.  see note 10 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities.
50
we assess our tax positions using a two-step process.  a tax position is recognized if it meets a "more likely than not" threshold, and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized.  uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date.  liabilities we record as a result of this analysis are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts, and are classified as current in "other accrued liabilities" or long-term in "other long-term liabilities" based on the time until expected payment.  additionally, we recognize accrued interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
during the fourth quarter of 2015, we early adopted on a prospective basis fasb accounting standards update no. 2015-17, "balance sheet classification of deferred taxes," ("asu 2015-17"), which is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2016.  asu 2015-17 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position.  prior to adopting asu 2015-17, we had a current deferred tax liability of $62 million for the period ending december 31, 2014.  prior periods are not retrospectively adjusted in the accompanying financial statements.
stock-based compensation we account for stock options and stock appreciation rights ("sars") measuring fair value using the black-scholes model. for restricted share units ("rsus"), compensation expense is calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant.  we account for performance stock units ("psus") measuring fair value using the monte carlo valuation model. there are several management assumptions required to determine the inputs into the black-scholes model and monte carlo valuation model.  our volatility and expected term assumptions used in the black-scholes model can significantly affect the fair value of stock options and sars. the monte carlo valuation model also utilizes multiple assumptions, including volatility, to determine the fair value of the award. changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of share-based compensation and consequently, the related amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements.  the extent of the impact will depend, in part, on the extent of awards in any given year.
market risk in addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations, we are also exposed to additional market risks.  market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.  our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate long-term debt.  we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowings and short-term borrowings under our bank credit facilities. a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed-rate debt instruments. as fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates. this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures.  we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions.
as of december 31, 2015, long-term variable rate borrowings represented approximately 33% of our total borrowings.  assuming a 100 basis-point increase in libor (in the case of term loan b, over the 1% floor specified in our senior credit facility), our annual interest cost would change by approximately $27 million based on gross amounts outstanding at december 31, 2015. assuming a 100 basis-point increase in hibor for the mgm china credit facility, our annual interest cost would change by approximately $16 million based on amounts outstanding at december 31, 2015. the following table provides additional information about our gross long-term debt subject to changes in interest rates:

in addition to the risk associated with our variable interest rate debt, we are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, mainly related to mgm china and to our operations at mgm macau and the development of mgm cotai. while recent fluctuations in exchange rates have not been significant, potential changes in policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the united states, china, macau or hong kong could cause variability in these exchange rates. we cannot assure
51
you that the hong kong dollar will continue to be pegged to the u.s. dollar or the current peg rate for the hong kong dollar will remain at the same level.  the possible changes to the peg of the hong kong dollar may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate thereof. as of december 31, 2015, a 1% increase in the hong kong dollar (the functional currency of mgm china) to the u.s. dollar exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our cash balance by $7 million and a 1% decrease in the exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our debt balance by $16 million.

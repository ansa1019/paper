2015 transaction overview hcr manorcare, inc.
hcrmc fourth quarter 2015
the post-acute/skilled nursing ("snf") industry and hcrmc continued to experience a challenging operating environment in 2015, due to the ongoing change in reimbursement models which reduces rates and lowers census, the result of shorter lengths of stay. hcrmc's normalized fixed charge coverage for the 12-month period ended december 31, 2015 was 1.07x.
for the fourth quarter 2015, hcrmc reported normalized ebitdar of $110 million, which decreased $36 million on a year-over-year basis compared to the fourth quarter 2014, and decreased $17 million sequentially compared to the third quarter 2015. the results were impacted by core operating performance weakness and unfavorable non-routine items discussed below. the level of performance was below expectations and uncharacteristic for the fourth quarter, which has historically been strong due in large part to increased census and the annual medicare rate increases on october 1.
hcrmc ended 2015 with $125 million of cash and cash equivalents and continues to be current on its obligations under the amended master lease (the "amended master lease").
37
core operating performance. before the impact from non-routine items described below, hcrmc's fourth quarter ebitdar was below its forecast, primarily due to the continued change in payor mix from traditional medicare to managed care plans, which reduced reimbursement rates and lowered census. as a result, hcrmc reported a decline in its core snf operating metrics (which excludes the 50 non-strategic disposition assets), with fourth quarter census decreasing 175 basis points from the prior year to 82.6%.
non-routine items. as discussed below, hcrmc is in the process of exiting 50 non-strategic assets, of which 21 sales were completed in the fourth quarter and an additional 11 closed in the first quarter 2016. as such, disruption resulting from transitioning operations to new owners and closing costs led to additional underperformance from this pool of assets. ebitdar losses from the sale of non-strategic assets totaled $11 million in the fourth quarter 2015, and $22 million for full year 2015. hcp continues to expect total proceeds of $350 million from the sales of the non-strategic assets, of which $280 million have closed to-date with the remaining $70 million expected to close in mid-2016.
in addition, hcrmc continues to defend against the doj civil complaint previously disclosed in april 2015. hcrmc incurred legal and regulatory defense costs of $3 million during the fourth quarter 2015 and $9 million for the full year 2015. the outcome of the doj civil complaint remains uncertain, and hcrmc expects to incur additional legal and regulatory defense costs in 2016.
as a result of hcrmc's fourth quarter performance deterioration and the related decline in its fcc, we placed our real estate portfolio operated by hcrmc on "watch list" status at year end 2015, and changed our accounting treatment to recognize rental income on a cash basis beginning january 2016. as such, we will no longer recognize non-cash accretion income under the hcrmc dfls (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).
the reduced growth outlook for the broader post-acute/snf industry indicates challenges to the improvement in hcrmc's financial performance over the next few years. at year end 2015, the company determined that it is probable that its hcrmc dfl investments are impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. in the fourth quarter 2015, the company recorded an allowance (impairment charge) for dfl losses of $817 million, reducing the carrying amount of its hcrmc dfl investments from $6.0 billion to $5.2 billion (see notes 6 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements). we also recorded a fourth quarter 2015 impairment charge of $19 million related to our equity investment in hcrmc opco (see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements).
hcp has engaged advisors and continues to work closely with hcrmc to jointly explore all opportunities that reduce our concentration, improve the credit quality and coverage of our amended master lease, and ensure hcrmc can continue to deliver high quality care and services.
hcrmc third quarter 2015
in october 2015, we concluded that our equity investment in hcrmc was other-than-temporarily impaired as of september 30, 2015, and we recorded an impairment charge of $27 million during the third quarter of 2015. the impairment charge reduced the carrying amount of our equity investment in hcrmc to $21 million. our impairment determination primarily resulted from our review of hcrmc operating results and market and industry data which, among other factors, showed a declining trend in admissions from hospitals and continuing trends in mix and length of stay driven by medicare advantage and other manage care plans.
hcrmc first quarter 2015
during the quarter ended march 31, 2015, hcp and hcrmc agreed to market for sale the real estate and operations associated with 50 non-strategic facilities that were under the master lease and security agreement (the "master lease") for an estimated total gross sales price of approximately $350 million. hcrmc receives annual rent reduction under the master lease based on 7.75% of the net sales proceeds received by hcp. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we completed sales of 22 non-strategic hcrmc facilities for $219 million. through february 8, 2016, 33 of the facility sales have closed, and the remaining facility sales are expected to close mid-2016.
additionally, hcp and hcrmc agreed to amend the master lease (the "hcrmc lease amendment"). commencing april 1, 2015, hcp provided an annual net rent reduction of $68 million, which equates to initial lease year rent of $473 million, compared to $541 million that would have commenced april 1, 2015 prior to the hcrmc lease
38
amendment. the contractual rent will increase by 3.0% annually during the initial term. in exchange, hcp received the following consideration:
·   fee ownership in nine post-acute facilities valued at $275 million with a median age of four years, owned and operated by hcrmc. hcp retained a lease receivable of equal value, earning income of $19 million annually (included in the amended initial lease year rent of $473 million above), which will be reduced as the facility purchases are completed. following the purchase of a facility, hcrmc will lease such facility from hcp pursuant to the amended master lease. the nine facilities will contribute an aggregate of $19 million of annual rent (subject to escalation) under the amended master lease. during the year ended december 31, 2015 and through february 8, 2016, hcrmc and hcp completed seven of the nine facility purchases for $184 million. the purchases of the remaining two facilities are expected to close mid-2016, subject to customary licensing and regulatory approvals;

·   a second lease receivable with an initial amount of $250 million, payable by hcrmc upon the earlier of: (i) the end of the initial term of the first renewal pool under the amended master lease; or (ii) certain capital or liquidity events of hcrmc, including an initial public offering or sale. the $250 million lease receivable amount will increase each year as follows: 3.0% in april 2016 through 2018, 4.0% in 2019, 5.0% in 2020 and 6.0% in 2021 until the end of the initial lease term; and

·   extension of the initial lease term by five years, to an average of 16 years.

in march 2015, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $478 million related to our hcrmc dfl investments. the non-cash charge reduced the carrying value of the hcrmc dfl investments from $6.6 billion to $6.1 billion, which represented the present value of the future lease payments under the amended master lease. the impairment determination resulted from discussions with hcrmc in which they expressed an increasing desire to reduce rent in consideration of potential economic trades to hcp prior to the april 1, 2015 rental increase of 3.5% under the master lease (without regard to the hcrmc lease amendment).
see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the hcrmc lease amendment and impairment of our hcrmc dfl investments, note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding our equity interest in hcrmc and the doj complaint against hcrmc, and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the impairments, which information is incorporated by reference herein.
investment transactions acquisition of private pay senior housing portfolio on june 30, 2015, hcp acquired a portfolio of 35 private pay senior housing communities from chartwell retirement residences, including two leasehold interests, representing 5,025 units for $847 million. the portfolio was acquired in a ridea structure (ridea iii), with brookdale owning a 10% noncontrolling interest. brookdale has operated these communities since 2011, and continues to manage the communities under a long-term management agreement.
the cove development in february 2015, we began construction on the first phase, $184 million (estimated total investment), of the cove at oyster point ("the cove"), a life science development in south san francisco, california. the first phase includes two "class a" buildings totaling 247,000 square feet that are expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2016.
edgewater business park in december 2015, we acquired a six-building lab campus, totaling 170,000 square feet in south san francisco, california for $83 million.
39
u.k. investments in december 2015, we purchased £28 million ($42 million) of four seasons health care's ("four seasons") £40 million senior secured term loan.
in september 2015, we amended and increased the commitment under our hc-one facility by £11 million, primarily to fund a development project in the u.k. and other capital improvements.
in may 2015, we provided a £27 million ($42 million) loan to fund maria mallaband care group's ("maria mallaband") acquisition of two care homes in the u.k. in july 2015, the loan was converted into fee ownership of the real estate at an equal value and the properties are triple-net leased to maria mallaband for an initial term of 15 years.
in april 2015, we converted £174 million of our total £502 million hc-one facility to fee ownership in a portfolio of 36 care homes subject to long-term triple-net leases that provide aggregate rent in the first year of £13 million. the contractual rent will increase annually by the retail price index ("rpi"), with rent resets to fair market value at the end of lease years 15 and 25. the triple-net leases have initial terms of 30 years with lessee termination options at the end of lease years 15 and 25.
in february 2015, we increased our u.k. hc-one debt investment ("hc-one facility") by £108 million ($164 million) to £502 million ($795 million) in conjunction with hc-one's acquisition of meridian healthcare. at closing, the hc-one facility was secured by 303 nursing and residential care homes representing over 13,900 beds in the u.k., primarily located in england and scotland.
acquisitions of on-campus medical office buildings in june 2015, we expanded our relationship with memorial hermann health system ("memorial hermann") through the acquisition of a portfolio of 11 on-campus mobs located in houston, texas in a sale-leaseback transaction for $225 million. memorial hermann, an 'a rated' health system, is the largest not-for-profit system in southeast texas and maintains the largest market share at 24% in the houston metro area. the mob portfolio, located on four campuses, has an aggregate 1.2 million rentable square feet and is subject to triple-net master leases with 10-year initial lease terms and four 5-year renewal terms. in october 2015, we issued a 49% noncontrolling interest in this portfolio ("hcp ventures v") for $110 million.
in april 2015, we acquired a mob in philadelphia, pennsylvania for $161 million. the mob is anchored by thomas jefferson university hospital, which is ranked second among best hospitals in the philadelphia metropolitan area by u.s. news and is owned by 'a rated' thomas jefferson university. the mob contains 705,000 rentable square feet and was 85% occupied at closing.
mbk joint venture in march 2015, we formed a new ridea joint venture ("mbk jv") with mbk senior living ("mbk"), a subsidiary of mitsui & co. ltd, that acquired three senior housing facilities for $126 million with hcp and mbk each owning a 50% equity interest. mbk manages these communities on behalf of this joint venture. at closing, we contributed $27 million of cash and mbk contributed the three senior housing facilities, which were encumbered by $78 million of mortgage debt. the mbk jv intends to acquire additional senior housing facilities by focusing on off-market transactions.
other investment transactions in november 2015, we exercised the purchase option under our $18 million par value development loan to acquire a newly built assisted living facility in olney, maryland for $39 million. the facility was 97% occupied at closing and was placed in a 100% owned ridea structure with brookdale managing the facility.
in november 2015, we expanded our senior housing joint venture partnerships with brookdale in the ccrc jv, an unconsolidated joint venture, through the acquisition of a ccrc in spring, texas for $40 million and in a ridea portfolio through the acquisition of a senior housing facility in victoria, texas for $10 million, of which our contribution was $19 million and $9 million, respectively.
40
in may 2015, we increased and extended our mezzanine loan facility with tandem health care ("tandem") to (i) fund an additional $55 million, which proceeds were used to repay a portion of tandem's existing senior and mortgage debt tranches; (ii) extend its maturity to october 2018; and (iii) extend the prepayment penalty period to january 2017. the mezzanine loan facility now totals $256 million and has an 11.5% blended coupon, or 11.9% blended yield-to-maturity.
in april 2015, we exercised the purchase option under our $33 million par value development loan to acquire a newly built assisted living and memory care facility in germantown, tennessee for $72 million. the facility was 93% occupied at closing and was placed in a ridea structure with brookdale acquiring a 10% noncontrolling interest and managing the facility.
in march 2015, we exercised the purchase option under our $14 million par value development loan to acquire a newly built assisted living and memory care facility in houston, texas for $36 million. the facility was 99% occupied at closing and was placed in a ridea structure with brookdale acquiring a 10% noncontrolling interest and managing the facility.
financing and capital recycling activities in december 2015, we issued $600 million of 4.00% senior unsecured notes due 2022. the notes were priced at 99.577% of the principal amount with a yield-to-maturity of 4.070%. net proceeds were used to prefund our $500 million 3.750% senior notes due february 2016. prior to such repayment, we used a portion of such proceeds to temporarily reduce outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit, which borrowings were principally used for acquisitions and investments.
during the second half of 2015, we received £34 million ($52 million) and $23 million in loan paydowns from asset disposition proceeds relating to our hc-one facility and loan to delphis operations, l.p., respectively.
in october 2015, we issued a 49% noncontrolling interest in hcp ventures v to an institutional capital investor for $110 million. hcp ventures v owns the mob portfolio we acquired through a sale-leaseback transaction with memorial hermann in june 2015. we retained a 51% controlling interest in hcp ventures v and will act as the managing member of the joint venture.
in july 2015, we sold a parcel of land at the cove for $11 million; additionally, in october 2015, we sold a parcel of land in our life science segment for $40 million.
in june 2015, we established an at-the-market equity offering program ("atm program"), in connection with the renewal of our shelf registration statement. under this program, we may sell shares of our common stock from time to time having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $750 million through a consortium of banks acting as sales agents or directly to the banks acting as principals. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we issued 1.8 million shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $40.14 for proceeds of $73 million, net of fees and commissions of $1 million.
in may 2015, we issued $750 million of 4.00% senior unsecured notes due 2025. the notes were priced at 99.126% of the principal amount with a yield-to-maturity of 4.107%. net proceeds were used to fund a portion of our investment transactions completed to date.
in january 2015, we issued $600 million of 3.40% senior unsecured notes due 2025. the notes were priced at 99.185% of the principal amount with a yield-to-maturity of 3.497%. net proceeds were used to repay the entire $105 million u.s. dollar amount outstanding on our revolving credit facility at closing and $200 million of 6.00% senior unsecured notes that matured on march 1, 2015. we used the remaining proceeds to repay $200 million of 7.07% senior unsecured notes maturing in june 2015 and for general corporate purposes.
in january 2015, to economically hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk from the hc-one facility, we completed a £220 million four-year unsecured term loan that accrues interest at gbp libor plus 0.975%, subject to adjustments based on our credit ratings. concurrently, we entered into a three-year interest rate swap agreement that fixes the rate of the term loan at 1.79%, and a foreign currency swap agreement that fixes the british pound sterling ("gbp") into u.s. dollars ("usd") exchange rate at 1.5149 on interest income from the hc-one facility in excess of interest payments on the term
41
loan. proceeds from this term loan repaid £220 million of the gbp balance drawn on our revolving credit facility that was used to fund our hc-one facility in november 2014.
dividends quarterly dividends paid during 2015 aggregated $2.26 per share, which represents a 3.7% increase from 2014. on january 28, 2016, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.575 per common share. the annualized distribution rate per share for 2016 increased 1.8% to $2.30, compared to $2.26 for 2015. the dividend will be paid on february 23, 2016 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on february 8, 2016.
results of operations we evaluate our business and allocate resources among our business segments: (i) senior housing, (ii) post-acute/skilled nursing, (iii) life science, (iv) medical office and (v) hospital. under the senior housing, post-acute/skilled nursing, life science and hospital segments, we primarily invest, through acquisition and development, in single operator or tenant properties and debt issued by operators in these sectors. under the medical office segment, we invest, through acquisition and development, in single or multi-tenant mobs, which generally require a greater level of property management. the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).
non-gaap financial measures    net operating income ("noi")
noi and adjusted noi are non-gaap supplemental financial measures used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate. noi is defined as rental and related revenues, including tenant recoveries, resident fees and services, and income from dfls, less property level operating expenses; noi excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income (loss) as presented in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. management believes noi provides relevant and useful information because it reflects only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents them on an unleveraged basis. adjusted noi is calculated as noi after eliminating the effects of straight-line rents, dfl accretion, amortization of market lease intangibles and lease termination fees. adjusted noi is oftentimes referred to as "cash noi." we use noi and adjusted noi to make decisions about resource allocations, assess and compare property level performance, and evaluate our same property portfolio ("spp"), as described below. we believe that net income (loss) is the most directly comparable u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") measure to noi. noi should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income (loss) as defined by gaap since it does not reflect various excluded items. further, our definition of noi may not be comparable to the definition used by other reits or real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating noi. noi and adjusted noi are non-gaap supplemental financial measures; for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to noi and adjusted noi and other relevant disclosure, refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
operating expenses generally relate to leased medical office and life science properties and senior housing ridea properties. we generally recover all or a portion of our leased medical office and life science property expenses through tenant recoveries. we present expenses as operating or general and administrative based on the underlying nature of the expense. periodically, we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the expenses.
same property portfolio ("spp")
spp noi and adjusted noi information allows us to evaluate the performance of our property portfolio under a consistent population by eliminating changes in the composition of our portfolio of properties. we identify our spp as stabilized properties that remained in operations and were consistently reported as leased properties or ridea properties for the duration of the year-over-year comparison periods presented, excluding assets held for sale. accordingly, it takes a stabilized property a minimum of 12 months in operations under a consistent reporting structure to be included in our spp. newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of lease up (typically when the tenant(s) controls the physical use of at least 80% of the space) or 12 months from the acquisition date. newly completed developments and redevelopments are considered stabilized at the earlier of lease up or 24 months from the date the
42
property is placed in service. spp noi excludes certain non-property specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis. spp adjusted noi excludes the effects of foreign exchange rate movements by using the average current period exchange rate to translate from gbp into usd for the comparison periods. a property is removed from our spp when it is sold, placed into redevelopment or changes its reporting structure.
funds from operations    we believe ffo applicable to common shares, diluted ffo applicable to common shares, and diluted ffo per common share are important supplemental non-gaap measures of operating performance for a reit. because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a reit that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue.
ffo, as defined by the nareit, is net income (loss) applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with gaap), excluding gains or losses from sales of property, impairments of, or related to, depreciable real estate, plus real estate and other depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for joint ventures. adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis. ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss). we compute ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition; however, other reits may report ffo differently or have a different interpretation of the current nareit definition from ours.    in addition, we present ffo before the impact of severance-related charges, litigation settlement charges, preferred stock redemption charges, impairments (recoveries) of non-depreciable assets, foreign currency remeasurement losses (gains) and transaction-related items (defined below) ("ffo as adjusted"). transaction-related items include acquisition and pursuit costs (e.g., due diligence and closing) and gains/charges incurred as a result of mergers and acquisitions and lease amendment or termination activities. management believes that ffo as adjusted provides a meaningful supplemental measurement of our ffo run-rate. this measure is a modification of the nareit definition of ffo and should not be used as an alternative to net income (loss) (determined in accordance with gaap) or nareit ffo. ffo and ffo as adjusted are non-gaap supplemental financial measures; for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to ffo and ffo as adjusted and other relevant disclosure, refer to "non-gaap financial measures reconciliations" below.
funds available for distribution fad is defined as ffo as adjusted after excluding the impact of the following: (i) amortization of acquired market lease intangibles, net; (ii) amortization of deferred compensation expense; (iii) amortization of deferred financing costs, net; (iv) straight-line rents; (v) accretion and depreciation related to dfls and lease incentive amortization (reduction of straight-line rents); and (vi) deferred revenues, excluding amounts amortized into rental income that are associated with tenant funded improvements owned/recognized by us and up-front cash payments made by tenants to reduce their contractual rents. also, fad: (i) is computed after deducting recurring capital expenditures, including leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements; and (ii) includes lease restructure payments and adjustments to compute our share of fad from our unconsolidated joint ventures and those related to ccrc non-refundable entrance fees. other reits or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating fad, and accordingly, our fad may not be comparable to those reported by other reits. although our fad computation may not be comparable to that of other reits, management believes fad provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our performance and is frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a reit. fad does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with gaap. fad is a non-gaap supplemental financial measure; for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to fad, as defined, and other relevant disclosure, refer to "non-gaap financial measures reconciliations" below.

(1)   for the reconciliation, see "non-gaap financial measures reconciliations" section below.

ffo as adjusted and fad increased $0.12 and $0.15 per share, respectively, primarily as a result of increased noi from our 2014 and 2015 acquisitions and incremental interest income from the repayments of three development loans resulting from our share in the appreciation of the underlying real estate assets. the increases were partially offset by the decline in income from dfls as a result of the hcrmc lease amendment and by placing our marketable debt securities issued by elli investments limited as part of the financing for its acquisition of four seasons health care ("four seasons notes") on cost-recovery method in the third quarter of 2015.
ffo and earnings per share ("eps") decreased $3.02 and $3.21 per share, respectively, primarily as a result of: (i) $1.3 billion of impairments related to our hcrmc dfl investments, (ii) $112 million of impairments related to our investment in four seasons notes, (iii) $46 million of impairments related to our equity investment in hcrmc, (iv) $38 million recognized in 2014 in net fees for terminating the leases on the 49 senior housing properties in the brookdale transaction, (v) transaction-related items of $33 million and (vi) a severance-related charge of $7 million. the decreases were partially offset by: (i) the aforementioned events impacting ffo as adjusted and fad, (ii) $6 million impairment recovery from a repayment of a loan in our hospital segment and (iii) foreign currency remeasurement gains of $5 million.
additionally, eps decreased primarily as a result of: (i) decreased gain on sales of real estate and (ii) increased depreciation expense, partially offset by the increased equity income from unconsolidated joint venture as a result of gain on sales of real estate from hcp ventures iii, llc and hcp ventures iv, llc.

ffo increased $0.05 per share primarily as a result of: (i) net gains from the 2014 brookdale transaction, (ii) increased noi from our spp and our 2013 and 2014 acquisitions, and (iii) a general and administrative charge in 2013 resulting from the termination of our former chief executive officer. the aforementioned were partially offset by: (i) an impairment charge in 2014 for our equity investment in hcrmc and (ii) favorable one-time items including interest income in 2013 from the par payoff of our barchester debt investments and sale of marketable equity securities.

ffo as adjusted and fad increased $0.02 and $0.03 per share, respectively, primarily as a result of increased noi from our spp and 2013 and 2014 acquisitions, which were partially offset by favorable one-time items including interest income in 2013 from the par payoff of our barchester debt investments and sale of marketable equity securities.
eps decreased $0.13 primarily as a result of: (i) decreased gain on sales of real estate and (ii) increased depreciation expense, partially offset by the net result of the aforementioned events impacting ffo.
segment noi and adjusted noi the tables below provide selected operating information for our spp and total property portfolio for each of our five business segments. for the year ended december 31, 2015, our consolidated spp consists of 993 properties representing properties acquired or placed in service and stabilized on or prior to january 1, 2014 and that remained in operations under a consistent reporting structure. for the year ended december 31, 2014, our consolidated spp consisted of 1,011 properties representing properties acquired or placed in service and stabilized on or prior to january 1, 2013 and that remained in operations under a consistent reporting structure. our consolidated total property portfolio represents 1,178, 1,108 and 1,079 properties at december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and excludes properties classified as discontinued operations.
senior housing    2015 and 2014
on june 30, 2015 (the "closing date"), we completed the ridea iii acquisition of 35 senior housing properties (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). we report the resident level fees and services revenues and corresponding operating expenses in our consolidated financial statements from the closing date. for periods subsequent to the closing date, we expect increases in resident fees and services revenue and operating expenses.

spp adjusted noi. spp adjusted noi improved as a result of annual rent increases and improved performance from ridea properties.
total portfolio noi and adjusted noi. our total portfolio noi decreased primarily as a result of: (i) $38 million of net revenues recognized from the 2014 brookdale transaction (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements) and (ii) an $8 million net termination fee related to our ridea iii acquisition in 2015 (see note 4 to the consolidated financial

noi and adjusted noi. spp and total portfolio noi increased primarily due to a net $12 million correction in 2013 that reduced previously recognized non-cash revenues including straight-line rents and accelerated amortization of below market lease intangibles related to our medical city dallas hospital. spp and total portfolio adjusted noi increased primarily as a result of annual rent escalations.
other income and expense items interest income. interest income increased $38 million to $112 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was primarily the result of: (i) fundings through our hc-one facility in november 2014 and february 2015 (see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements), (ii) incremental interest income from the repayments of three development loans resulting from the appreciation of the underlying real estate assets and (iii) additional fundings under our mezzanine loan facility with tandem in may 2015 (see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). the increases in interest income were partially offset by a change in interest income recognition on our investment in the four seasons notes (see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements).
interest income decreased $12 million to $74 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the decrease was primarily the result of the repayment of our barchester loan in september 2013, partially offset by interest earned from the june 2013 funding under the tandem health care mezzanine loan facility and the november 2014 hc-one facility (see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).
interest expense. for the year ended december 31, 2015, interest expense increased $40 million to $480 million. the increase was primarily the result of: (i) our senior unsecured notes offerings during 2014 and 2015, (ii) increased borrowings from our term loan originated in 2015, (iii) increased borrowings under our line of credit facility and (iv) lower capitalized interest. the increases in interest expense were partially offset by repayments of senior unsecured notes and mortgage debt that matured during 2014 and 2015. the increased borrowings were used to fund our investment activities and to refinance our debt maturities.

depreciation and amortization expense. depreciation and amortization expense increased $51 million to $511 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was primarily the result of the impact of our acquisitions and redevelopment projects placed in service during 2014 and 2015. the increases in depreciation and amortization expense were partially offset by additional depreciation expense recognized in 2014 as a result of a change in estimate of the depreciable life and residual value of certain properties.

general and administrative expenses. general and administrative expenses increased $14 million to $96 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was primarily the result of a $7 million severance-related charge resulting from the resignation of our former executive vice president and chief investment officer in june 2015. in addition, the increase was the result of higher compensation related expenses.
general and administrative expenses decreased $21 million to $82 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the year ended december 31, 2013 included $27 million of severance-related charges resulting from the termination of our former chief executive officer (see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).
acquisition and pursuit costs. acquisition and pursuit costs increased $10 million to $27 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was primarily due to higher levels of transactional activity in 2015, including transactional costs related to the u.k. and ridea iii investments.
acquisition and pursuit costs increased $11 million to $17 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was primarily due to higher levels of transactional activity in 2014, including transactional costs related to the 2014 brookdale transaction and the u.k. real estate and debt investments.
impairments (recovery).  during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recognized the following impairment charges: (i) $1.3 billion related to our hcrmc dfl investments, (ii) $112 million related to our investment in four seasons notes and (iii) $3 million related to a mob. the impairment charges were partially offset by a $6 million impairment recovery related to a repayment of a loan in our hospital segment. see notes 6 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
other income, net. for the year ended december 31, 2015, other income, net increased $7 million to $14 million. the increase was primarily the result of the impact from remeasuring assets and liabilities denominated in gbp to usd.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, other income, net decreased $11 million to $8 million. the decrease was primarily the result of gains from the sale of marketable equity securities during 2013; there were no comparable gains from the sale of marketable securities in 2014.
income tax benefit (expense). for the year ended december 31, 2015, income taxes decreased by $9 million to a benefit of $9 million. the decrease was primarily the result of the tax benefit related to our share of operating losses from our ridea joint ventures formed as part of the 2014 brookdale transaction and related to our u.k. real estate investments in 2015.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, income tax expense decreased by $6 million to $250,000. the decrease in income taxes was primarily due to the losses of our trs entities during the year ended december 31, 2014.
equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures. for the year ended december 31, 2015, equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased $8 million to $57 million. the increase in equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures was primarily the result of our share of gains on sales of real estate from hcp ventures iii, llc and hcp ventures iv, llc, partially offset by our share of operating losses recognized from the ccrc jv.
in december 2015, we concluded that our equity investment in hcrmc was other-than-temporarily impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $19 million and, prospectively, income will be recognized only if cash distributions are received from hcrmc (see notes 8 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements).
54
for the year ended december 31, 2014, equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased $15 million to $50 million. the decrease in equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures was primarily the result of: (i) our share of operating losses from the ccrc jv investment formed in 2014; (ii) the decline in operating performance of our hcrmc equity interest; and (iii) a 2013 one-time distribution received from a senior housing joint venture that exceeded our investment balance.
impairment of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. during the year ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized impairments of $46 million and $36 million, respectively, related to our equity ownership interest in hcrmc (see notes 8 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements).
gain on sales of real estate (continuing and discontinued operations). during the year ended december 31, 2015, we sold 10 properties for total gain on sales of real estate of $6 million. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we sold five properties for total gain on sales of real estate of $31 million (see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).
during the year ended december 31, 2013, we sold 13 properties for total gain on sales of real estate of $70 million (see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).
liquidity and capital resources we anticipate: (i) funding recurring operating expenses, (ii) meeting debt service requirements including principal payments and maturities, and (iii) satisfying our distributions to our stockholders and non-controlling interest members, for the next 12 months primarily by using cash flow from operations, available cash balances and cash from our various financing activities. additionally, we expect to partially meet our scheduled financing maturities for 2016 (excluding future acquisitions) with the proceeds from our december 2015 $600 million senior unsecured note offering.
our principal investing liquidity needs for the next 12 months are to:
·   fund capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs; and

·   fund future acquisition, transactional and development activities.

we anticipate satisfying these future investing needs using one or more of the following:
·   issuance of common or preferred stock;

·   issuance of additional debt, including unsecured notes and mortgage debt;

·   draws on our credit facilities; and/or

·   sale or exchange of ownership interests in properties.

access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness, as well as our ability to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt. credit ratings impact our ability to access capital and directly impact our cost of capital as well. for example, as noted below, our revolving line of credit facility accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to libor plus a margin that depends upon our credit ratings. we also pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends upon our credit ratings. as of january 29, 2016, we had a credit rating of bbb+ from fitch, baa1 from moody's and bbb+ from s&p on our senior unsecured debt securities.

cash flow summary the following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below.
cash and cash equivalents were $347 million and $184 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, reflecting an increase of $163 million. the following table sets forth changes in cash flows (dollars in thousands):
year ended december 31,

the increase in operating cash flow is the result of a net paydown of working capital. our cash flow from operations is dependent upon the occupancy levels of our buildings, rental rates on leases, our tenants' performance on their lease obligations, the level of operating expenses and other factors.
the following are significant investing and financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2015:
·   made investments of $2.4 billion (development, leasing and acquisition of real estate, and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and loans);

·   paid dividends on common stock of $1 billion, which were generally funded by cash provided by our operating activities and cash on hand; and

·   raised proceeds of $2.7 billion primarily from issuing senior unsecured notes, the term loan originated in january 2015, net borrowings under our bank line of credit, issuances of common stock and noncontrolling interest, and an additional $684 million from sales of real estate, and loan and dfl repayments; and repaid $969 million of senior unsecured notes, bank line of credit and mortgage debt.

debt bank line of credit and term loans. our $2.0 billion unsecured revolving line of credit facility (the "facility") matures on march 31, 2018 and contains a one-year extension option. borrowings under the facility accrue interest at libor plus a margin that depends upon our credit ratings. we pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends on our credit ratings. based on our credit ratings at january 29, 2016, the margin on the facility was 0.925%, and the facility fee was 0.15%. the facility also includes a feature that will allow us to increase the borrowing capacity by an aggregate amount of up to $500 million, subject to securing additional commitments from existing lenders or new lending institutions. at december 31, 2015, we had $397 million (£270 million) outstanding under the facility with a weighted average effective interest rate of 1.72%.
on july 30, 2012, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks for a £137 million ($202 million at december 31, 2015) four-year unsecured term loan (the "2012 term loan"). based on our credit ratings at january 29, 2016, the 2012 term loan accrues interest at a rate of gbp libor plus 1.20%. concurrent with the closing of the 2012 term loan, we entered into a four-year interest rate swap contract that fixes the rate of the 2012 term loan at 1.81%, subject to adjustments based on our credit ratings. the 2012 term loan contains a one-year committed extension option.
on january 12, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks for a £220 million ($323 million at december 31, 2015) four-year unsecured term loan (the "2015 term loan") that accrues interest at a rate of gbp libor plus 0.975%, subject to adjustments based on our credit ratings (the 2012 and 2015 term loans are collectively, the "term loans"). proceeds from this term loan were used to repay a £220 million draw on the facility that partially funded the november 2014 hc-one facility (see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). concurrently, we entered into a three-year interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixes the interest rate of the 2015 term loan at 1.79% (see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements). the 2015 term loan contains a one-year committed extension option.
56
the facility and term loans contain certain financial restrictions and other customary requirements. among other things, these covenants, using terms defined in the agreements, (i) limit the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total asset value to 60%, (ii) limit the ratio of secured debt to consolidated total asset value to 30%, (iii) limit the ratio of unsecured debt to consolidated unencumbered asset value to 60% and (iv) require a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.5 times. the facility and term loans also require a minimum consolidated tangible net worth of $9.5 billion at december 31, 2015. at december 31, 2015, we were in compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements of the facility and term loans.
senior unsecured notes. at december 31, 2015, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with an aggregate principal balance of $9.2 billion. interest rates on the notes ranged from 2.79% to 6.88% with a weighted average effective interest rate of 4.68% and a weighted average maturity of six years at december 31, 2015. the senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants including limitations on debt, maintenance of unencumbered assets, cross-acceleration provisions and other customary terms. at december 31, 2015, we believe we were in compliance with these covenants.
mortgage debt. at december 31, 2015, we had $933 million in aggregate principal amount of mortgage debt outstanding that is secured by 62 healthcare facilities (including redevelopment properties) with a carrying value of $1.2 billion. interest rates on the mortgage debt ranged from 3.14% to 8.35% with a weighted average effective interest rate of 6.21% and a weighted average maturity of two years at december 31, 2015.
mortgage debt generally requires monthly principal and interest payments, is collateralized by real estate assets and is generally non-recourse. mortgage debt typically restricts transfer of the encumbered assets, prohibits additional liens, restricts prepayment, requires payment of real estate taxes, requires maintenance of the assets in good condition, requires maintenance of insurance on the assets, and includes conditions to obtain lender consent to enter into and terminate material leases. some of the mortgage debt is also cross-collateralized by multiple assets and may require tenants or operators to maintain compliance with the applicable leases or operating agreements of such real estate assets.
equity at december 31, 2015, we had 465 million shares of common stock outstanding, equity totaled $9.7 billion, and our equity securities had a market value of $18.0 billion.
at december 31, 2015, non-managing members held an aggregate of four million units in five limited liability companies ("downreits") for which we are the managing member. the downreit units are exchangeable for an amount of cash approximating the then-current market value of shares of our common stock or, at our option, shares of our common stock (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock splits and reclassifications).
at-the-market program. in june 2015, we established an atm program, in connection with the renewal of our shelf registration statement. under this program, we may sell shares of our common stock from time to time having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $750 million through a consortium of banks acting as sales agents or directly to the banks acting as principals. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we issued 1.8 million shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $40.14 for proceeds of $73 million, net of fees and commissions of $1 million. actual future sales will depend upon a variety of factors, including but not limited to market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and our capital needs. we have no obligation to sell the remaining shares available for sale under our program.
shelf registration we filed a prospectus with the sec as part of a registration statement on form s-3asr, using a shelf registration process, which expires in june 2018. under the "shelf" process, we may sell any combination of the securities described in the prospectus through one or more offerings. the securities described in the prospectus include common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, debt securities and warrants.
57
capital market outlook the capital markets have facilitated our continued growth, including our international expansion. for the 24 months ended december 31, 2015, we have raised $3.1 billion in senior unsecured notes, originated a £220 million ($333 million) four-year unsecured term loan and increased our facility from $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion. the capital raised, in combination with available cash and borrowing capacity under our facility, supported $4.2 billion of investments completed during the 24 months ended december 31, 2015. we believe our equity and debt investors, as well as our banking relationships, will provide additional capital as we pursue new investment opportunities.

off-balance sheet arrangements we own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described under note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable. in addition, we have certain properties which serve as collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities, as described under note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. our risk of loss for these certain properties is limited to the outstanding debt balance plus penalties, if any. we have no other material off-balance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except those described above under "contractual obligations".
inflation our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators, based on the consumer price index or other measures, and/or additional rent based on increases in the tenants' operating revenues. most of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes, insurance and utilities. substantially all of our senior housing, life science, post-acute/skilled nursing and hospital leases require the tenant or operator to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs. we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset, in part, by the tenant or operator expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above.

(1)   for the year ended december 31, 2015, transaction-related items primarily relate to acquisition and pursuit costs. for the year ended december 31, 2014, transaction-related items include a net benefit from the 2014 brookdale transaction, partially offset by acquisition and pursuit costs. for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, transaction-related items are primarily attributable to acquisition and pursuit costs. for the year ended december 31, 2011, transaction-related items are primarily attributable to our hcrmc acquisition.

(2)   for the year ended december 31, 2015, other impairments, net include impairment charges of: (i) $1.3 billion related to our hcrmc dfl investments, (ii) $112 million related to our four seasons notes and (iii) $46 million related to our equity investment in hcrmc, partially offset by impairment recovery of $6 million related to a loan payoff in our hospital segment. for the year ended december 31, 2014, the other impairment relates to our equity ownership interest in hcrmc.

(3)   for the year ended december 31, 2015, the severance-related charge relates to the resignation of our former executive vice president and chief investment officer. for the year ended december 31, 2013, the severance-related charge relates to the termination of our former chairman, chief executive officer and president.

(4)   our weighted average shares for the year ended december 31, 2012 used to calculate diluted ffo as adjusted eliminate the impact of 22 million shares from our common stock offering completed on october 19, 2012; proceeds from this offering were used to fund the blackstone jv acquisition. our weighted average shares used to calculate diluted ffo as adjusted eliminate the impact of 30 million shares from our march 2011 common stock offering (excludes 4.5 million shares sold to the underwriters upon exercise of their option to purchase additional shares), which issuances increased our weighted average shares by 12.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2011; proceeds from these offerings were used to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the hcrmc acquisition.

(5)   excludes $3 million related to the acceleration of deferred compensation for restricted stock units and stock options that vested upon the resignation of our former executive vice president and chief investment officer, which is included in the severance-related charge for year ended december 31, 2015. excludes $16.7 million related to the acceleration of deferred compensation for restricted stock units and options that vested upon termination of the our former chief executive officer, which is included in severance-related charges for the year ended december 31, 2013.

(6)   excludes $11.3 million related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees related to an expired bridge loan commitment and $0.8 million related to the amortization of deferred issuance costs of the senior notes, which costs are included in transaction-related items for the year ended december 31, 2011.

(7)   our ownership interest in hcrmc is accounted for using the equity method, which requires an ongoing elimination of dfl income that is proportional to our ownership in hcrmc. further, our share of earnings from hcrmc (equity income) increases for the corresponding elimination of related lease expense recognized at the hcrmc entity level, which we present as a non-cash joint venture fad adjustment. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion.

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time, our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements. from time to time, we re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions. in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp, inc., our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control, through voting rights or other means. we consolidate investments in variable interest entities ("vies") when we are the primary beneficiary of the vie. a variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie.
we make judgments about which entities are vies based on an assessment of whether (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, do not have a controlling financial interest, (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support, or (iii) substantially all of the entity's activities involve or are performed on behalf of an equity investor that holds disproportionately few voting rights. we make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control over an entity and whether we are (or are not) the primary beneficiary of a vie. consideration of various factors includes, but is not limited to, our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, our form of ownership interest, our representation on the entity's governing body, the size and seniority of our investment, and our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions, replace the manager and/or liquidate the entity, if applicable. our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements. when we perform a re-analysis of the primary beneficiary at a date other than at inception of the vie, our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary.
if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie, our consolidated financial statements would include the operating results of the vie rather than the results of the variable interest in the vie. we would require the vie to provide us timely financial information and would review the internal controls of the vie to determine if we could rely on the financial information it provides. if the vie has deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting, or does not provide us with timely financial information, this may adversely impact the quality and/or timing of our financial reporting and our internal controls over financial reporting.
revenue recognition at the inception of a new lease arrangement, including new leases that arise from amendments, we assess the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification. a lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met: (i) transfer of ownership to the lessee prior to or shortly after the end of the lease term, (ii) lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term, (iii) the lease term is equal to 75% or more of the underlying property's economic life, or (iv) the present value of future minimum lease payments (excluding executory costs) is equal to 90% or more of the excess estimated fair value (over retained tax credits) of the leased asset. if one of the four criteria is met and the minimum lease payments are determined to be reasonably predictable and collectible, the lease arrangement is generally accounted for as a direct financing lease. if the assumptions utilized in the above
61
classifications assessments were different, our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different; thus the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would have been impacted, which may be material to our consolidated financial statements.
we recognize rental revenue for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectibility of all minimum lease payments is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of a leased asset. if the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or us. when we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially complete. when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. the determination of ownership of a tenant improvement is subject to significant judgment. if our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements was different, the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted.
certain leases provide for additional rents that are contingent upon a percentage of the facility's revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds. such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant, or estimates of tenant results, exceed the base amount or other thresholds. the recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and, to a certain extent, is dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us. our estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, including an allowance for operating lease straight-line rent receivables, for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on a continuous basis. this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions, property performance, credit enhancements and other factors. for straight-line rent receivable amounts, our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease. we exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. these estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.
we use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from dfls. for leases accounted for as dfls, the net investment in the dfl represents receivables for the sum of future minimum lease payments receivable and the estimated residual values of the leased properties, less the unamortized unearned income. unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured. the determination of estimated useful lives and residual values are subject to significant judgment. if these assessments were to change, the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted.
loans receivable are classified as held-for-investment based on management's intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity. we recognize interest income on loans, including the amortization of discounts and premiums, using the interest method applied on a loan-by-loan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured. premiums, discounts and related costs are recognized as yield adjustments over the term of the related loans. if management determined that certain loans should no longer be classified as held-for-investment, the timing and amount of our interest income recognized would be impacted.
loans receivable and dfls (collectively, "finance receivables"), are reviewed and assigned an internal rating of performing, watch list or workout. finance receivables that are deemed performing meet all present contractual obligations, and collection and timing, of all amounts owed is reasonably assured. watch list finance receivables are defined as finance receivables that do not meet the definition of performing or workout. workout finance receivables are defined as finance receivables in which the company has determined, based on current information and events, that it is probable (i) it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the agreement, (ii) the tenant, operator, or borrower is delinquent on making payments under the contractual terms of the agreement (iii) and the company has commenced action or anticipates pursuing action in the near term to seek recovery of its investment.
62
finance receivables are placed on nonaccrual status when management determines that the collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured (the asset will have an internal rating of either watch list or workout). further, we perform a credit analysis to support the tenant's, operator's, borrower's and/or guarantor's repayment capacity and the underlying collateral values. we use the cash basis method of accounting for finance receivables placed on nonaccrual status unless one of the following conditions exist whereby we utilize the cost recovery method of accounting: (i) if we determine that it is probable that we will only recover the recorded investment in the finance receivable, net of associated allowances or charge-offs (if any), or (ii) we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of an impaired finance receivable. for cash basis method of accounting we apply payments received, excluding principal paydowns, to interest income so long as that amount does not exceed the amount that would have been earned under the original contractual terms. for cost recovery method of accounting any payment received is applied to reduce the recorded investment. generally, we return a finance receivable to accrual status when all delinquent payments become current under the terms of the loan or lease agreements and collectibility of the remaining contractual loan or lease payments is reasonably assured.
allowances are established for finance receivables on an individual basis utilizing an estimate of probable losses, if they are determined to be impaired. finance receivables are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease. an allowance is based upon our assessment of the lessee's or borrower's overall financial condition, economic resources, payment record, the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and, if appropriate, the net realizable value of any collateral. these estimates consider all available evidence, including the expected future cash flows discounted at the finance receivable's effective interest rate, fair value of collateral, general economic conditions and trends, historical and industry loss experience, and other relevant factors, as appropriate. should a finance receivable be deemed partially or wholly uncollectible, the uncollectible balance is charged off against the allowance in the period in which the uncollectible determination has been made.
real estate we make estimates as part of our process for allocating a purchase price to the various identifiable assets of an acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each asset. the most significant components of our allocations are typically buildings as-if-vacant, land and in-place leases. in the case of allocating fair value to buildings and intangibles, our fair value estimates will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of each asset acquired or the remaining lease term. in the case of allocating fair value to in-place leases, we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired in-place leases.
a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties. after determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. the capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development. we consider a construction project to be considered substantially complete and available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements.
impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles ("real estate assets") when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the real estate assets may not be recoverable, but at least annually. recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the real estate assets to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows. the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability, we consider market conditions, as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate assets is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset.
63
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually based on certain qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. potential impairment indicators and qualitative factors include a significant decline in real estate valuations, restructuring plans, current macroeconomic conditions, state of the equity and capital markets or a significant decline in the value of our market capitalization. if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we apply the required two-step quantitative approach. the quantitative procedures of the two-step approach (i) compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill and, if necessary, (ii) compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill as if it had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test. the excess fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill, is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment, if any. we estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities in the reporting unit through various valuation techniques, including applying capitalization rates to segment net operating income, quoted market values and third-party appraisals, as necessary. the fair value of the reporting unit may also include an allocation of an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for the company.
the determination of the fair value of real estate assets and goodwill involves significant judgment. this judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate assets and reporting units, future operating results and resulting cash flows of each real estate asset whose carrying amount may not be recoverable. our ability to accurately predict future operating results, resulting cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments. while we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results.
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale or contribution of the interests to the joint venture. we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment indicators based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value. if we determine there is a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture below its carrying value and it is other-than-temporary, an impairment is recorded. the determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and as to whether a deficiency in fair value is "other-than-temporary" involves significant judgment. our estimates consider all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates, general economic conditions and trends, severity and duration of a fair value deficiency, and other relevant factors. capitalization rates, discount rates and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based upon rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments. while we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results.
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with reit requirements. our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws, and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized. adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of: (i) audits conducted by federal, state and local tax authorities, (ii) our ability to qualify as a reit, (iii) the potential for built-in gain recognition, and (iv) changes in tax laws. adjustments required in any given period are included within the income tax provision.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.

forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k, including this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, contains statements that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. all statements that do not concern historical facts are forward-looking statements and include, among other things, statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions and/or strategies for the future. these forward-looking statements include statements regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, expectations for treatment growth rates, revenue per treatment, expense growth, levels of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, operating income, cash flow, operating cash flow, estimated tax rates, capital expenditures, the development of new dialysis centers and dialysis center acquisitions, government and commercial payment rates, revenue estimating risk and the impact of our level of indebtedness on our financial performance and including earnings per share. these statements involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, risks resulting from the concentration of profits generated by higher-paying commercial payor plans for which there is continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates, and a reduction in the number of patients under such plans, which may result in the loss of revenues or patients, a reduction in government payment rates under the medicare esrd program or other government-based programs, the impact of the cms 2015 medicare advantage benchmark structure, risks arising from potential federal and/or state legislation that could have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability, changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies, or pharmaceutical pricing, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations including compliance with the provisions of our current cia and current or potential investigations by various government entities and related government or private-party proceedings, and the related restrictions on our business and operations required by the cia and other settlement terms, and the financial impact thereof, continued increased competition from large- and medium-sized dialysis providers that compete directly with us, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, changing affiliation models for physicians, and the emergence of new models of care introduced by the government or private sector that may erode our patient base and reimbursement rates such as acos, ipas and integrated delivery systems, or to businesses outside of dialysis and hcp's business, our ability to complete acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we might be considering or announce, or to integrate and successfully operate any business we may acquire or have acquired, including hcp, or to expand our operations and services to markets outside the u.s., the variability of our cash flows, the risk that we might invest material amounts of capital and incur significant costs in connection with the growth and development of our international operations, yet we might not be able to operate them profitably anytime soon, if at all, risks arising from the use of accounting estimates, judgments and interpretations in our financial statements, risk of losing key hcp employees, potential disruption from the hcp transaction making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships with customers, partners, associated physicians and physician groups, hospitals and others, the risk that laws regulating the corporate practice of medicine could restrict the manner in which hcp conducts its business, the risk that the cost of providing services under hcp's agreements may exceed our compensation, the risk that reductions in reimbursement rates, including medicare advantage rates, and future regulations may negatively impact hcp's business, revenue and profitability, the risk that hcp may not be able to successfully establish a presence in new geographic regions or successfully address competitive threats that could reduce its profitability, the risk that a disruption in hcp's healthcare provider networks could have an adverse effect on hcp's business operations and profitability, the risk that reductions in the quality ratings of health maintenance organization plan customers of hcp could have an adverse effect on hcp's business, or the risk that health plans that acquire health maintenance organizations may not be willing to contract with hcp or may be willing to contract only on less favorable terms, and the other risk factors set forth in part ii, item 1a. of this annual report on form 10-k. we base our forward-looking statements on information currently available to us at the time of this annual report on form 10-k, and except as required by law we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise.

the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and "item 1. business".
company overview the company consists of two major divisions, kidney care and hcp. kidney care is comprised of our u.s. dialysis and related lab services, our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including our international operations, and our corporate administrative support. our u.s. dialysis and related lab services business is our largest line of business, which is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services in the u.s. for patients suffering from chronic kidney failure, also known as esrd. our hcp division is a patient- and physician-focused integrated healthcare delivery and management company with over two decades of providing coordinated, outcomes-based medical care in a cost-effective manner.
our overall financial performance was once again strong for 2015, excluding certain non-gaap items, and was characterized by solid treatment volume growth, primarily from non-acquired growth at existing and new dialysis centers, cost control initiatives, and productivity and payor mix improvements in our dialysis business, and solid growth in hcp's adjusted operating income. however, hcp continued to experience a reduction in medicare advantage reimbursement rates in 2015, which negatively impacted its operations. in addition, our dialysis segment experienced a large increase in our pharmaceutical costs.
some of our major accomplishments and financial operating performance indicators in 2015 and year over year were as follows:
·   improved clinical outcomes in our u.s. dialysis operations, including second year in a row as leader of the cms five star rating system;

·   consolidated net revenue growth of approximately 7.7%;

·   a 5.2% net revenue growth related to our u.s. dialysis segment operations related to an increase of $6 per treatment;

·   an increase in hcp's net revenue of approximately 9.6% related to an increase of its ffs business and senior capitated revenue;

·   an increase in other ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenue of 21.3%;

·   continued growth in u.s. dialysis treatments related to an increase of approximately 4.1% in the overall number of u.s. dialysis related treatments;

·   normalized non-acquired u.s. dialysis treatment growth of 3.9%;

·   added a net total of 72 u.s. dialysis centers and added a net total of 27 international dialysis centers; and

·   strong operating cash flows of $1.557 billion, which have been reduced by approximately $304 million of after-tax payments made in connection with the settlement of the vainer private civil suit.

however, we face uncertainty and various challenges in 2016 as we undertake initiatives to mitigate increases in clinical costs that we expect to experience due to inflation and other factors without any corresponding increase in our dialysis medicare reimbursement rates. in addition, congress could still make significant changes to medicare and medicaid under the healthcare reform legislation that was enacted in the u.s. and there is uncertainty around the potential negative impact of healthcare insurance exchanges. we could also experience delays in state certification and other regulatory issues. hcp also faces uncertainty in medicare advantage reimbursement rates as the government continues to modify adjustments to the rates. additionally, there is the potential for non-renewal of payor contracts for hcp, which could cause significant patient and employer disruption. physician practices of prescribing pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical costs could also have a significant impact on our operating results. we also remain committed to our international expansion plans that will continue to require investment. in addition, if the percentage of our dialysis patients with commercial payors deteriorates or if we experience a decrease in our overall commercial rates, our operating results could be adversely affected.

(1)   for the year ended december 31, 2015, we have excluded estimated non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $210 million primarily related to certain hcp reporting units, an estimated accrual of $22 million for damages and liabilities associated with our pharmacy business, which is included in general and administrative expenses, and $495 million related to a settlement charge in connection with the vainer private civil suit. in addition, for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we have excluded $17 million and $397 million, respectively, related to loss contingency accruals for the settlement of the 2010 and 2011 u.s. attorney physician relationship investigations. in 2013, we have also excluded $57 million related to a decrease in hcp's 2013 contingent earn-out obligation and an adjustment of $8 million to reduce a tax asset associated with the hcp acquisition escrow provisions. these are non-gaap measures and are not intended as substitutes for the gaap equivalent measures. we have presented these adjusted amounts because management believes that these presentations enhance a user's understanding of our normal consolidated operating income by excluding certain unusual items which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results of operations. as a result, adjusting for these amounts allows for comparison to our normal prior period results.

consolidated net revenues consolidated net revenues for 2015 increased by approximately $987 million, or 7.7%, from 2014. this increase in consolidated net revenues was due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $431 million, principally due to solid volume growth from additional treatments from non-acquired growth and from an increase of $6 in the average dialysis revenue per treatment, primarily from an increase in our average commercial payment rates and improvement in our commercial payor mix. consolidated net revenues also increased by $335 million as a result of hcp's growth from acquisitions and timing of the recognition of additional medicaid risk sharing revenue, as described below. in addition, revenue increased by approximately $243 million in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives driven primarily from growth in our pharmacy services and our disease management services, as well as expansion in our international operations. these increases were partially offset by an increase in reserves for refunds of prior period pharmacy reimbursements.
64
consolidated net revenues for 2014 increased by approximately $1.031 billion, or 8.8%, from 2013. this increase in consolidated net revenues was due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $447 million, principally due to strong volume growth from additional treatments from non-acquired growth and dialysis center acquisitions and from an increase of $2 in the average dialysis revenue per treatment, primarily from the recognition of certain california medicaid revenue that was previously reserved and an increase in some of our commercial payment rates, partially offset by changes in our commercial payor mix. consolidated net revenues also increased by $306 million as a result of an increase in hcp's senior capitated members and growth from acquisitions. in addition, revenue increased by approximately $287 million in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives driven primarily from growth in our pharmacy services, our international operations and our disease management services.
consolidated operating income consolidated operating income of $1.171 billion for 2015 decreased by approximately $644 million from 2014, which includes estimated goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of approximately $210 million, an estimated pharmacy accrual of $22 million and a private litigation settlement charge of $495 million in 2015 and a $17 million loss contingency accrual in 2014. excluding these items from their respective periods, adjusted consolidated operating income for 2015 would have increased by $66 million, or 3.6%. adjusted consolidated operating income increased primarily as a result of strong volume growth from additional treatments from non-acquired growth in the dialysis and related lab services business, as well as an increase in our average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $6, as discussed above. adjusted consolidated operating income also increased due to improved results at hcp, excluding the impairment charges, due to growth from acquisitions and an increase in medicaid risk sharing revenue. these increases were negatively impacted by an increase in the amount of losses in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives and increased losses in our international operations, as discussed below. in addition, we experienced higher pharmaceutical unit costs, an increase in long-term incentive compensation, an increase in hcp's medical claims expenses from higher utilization, and an increase in our dialysis provision for uncollectible accounts of approximately $53 million.
consolidated operating income of $1.815 billion for 2014 increased by approximately $265 million, or 17.1% from 2013, which includes the estimated loss contingency reserve of $17 million and $397 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. in addition, 2013 includes a contingent earn-out obligation adjustment of $57 million and an adjustment to reduce a tax asset associated with the hcp acquisition escrow provisions of $8 million. excluding these items from their respective periods, adjusted consolidated operating income would have decreased by $66 million, or 3.5%, primarily as a result of a decrease in hcp's operating income of approximately $170 million, principally driven by a decline in medicare advantage rates. adjusted consolidated operating income for 2014 also decreased as a result of higher pharmaceutical unit costs, an increase in long-term incentive compensation, an increase in hcp's medical claims expenses from higher utilization and an increase in our dialysis provision for uncollectible accounts of approximately $72 million. adjusted consolidated operating income was positively impacted by an increase in the dialysis and related lab services net revenues as a result of strong volume growth from additional treatments due to non-acquired growth and acquisitions. in addition, our average dialysis revenue per treatment increased by approximately $2. adjusted consolidated income also benefited from improved productivity, lower losses associated with our ancillary services and strategic initiatives and growth in hcp's senior capitated members.
u.s. dialysis and related lab services business our u.s. dialysis and related lab services business is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services through a network of 2,251 outpatient dialysis centers in 46 states and the district of columbia, serving a total of approximately 180,000 patients. we also provide acute inpatient dialysis services in approximately 900 hospitals. we estimate that we have approximately a 36% market share in the u.s. based upon the number of patients that we serve. in 2015, our overall network of u.s. outpatient dialysis centers net increased by 72 dialysis centers primarily as a result of the opening new dialysis centers and from acquisitions of dialysis centers. in addition, the overall number of patients that we serve in the u.s. increased by approximately 4.1% in 2015 as compared to 2014. all references in this document to dialysis and related lab services refer only to our u.s. dialysis and related lab services business.
our dialysis and related lab services stated mission is to be the provider, partner and employer of choice. we believe our attention to these three stakeholders-our patients, our business partners, and our teammates-represents the major driver of our long-term performance, although we are subject to the impact of several external factors such as government policy, physician practice patterns, commercial payor payment rates and the mix of commercial and government patients. two principal non-financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. we have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the davita quality index (dqi). our clinical outcomes as measured by dqi have improved over each of the past several years which we believe directly decreases patient mortalities. our patient mortality percentages have decreased from 19.0% in 2001 to 13.7% in 2014. although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry, we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the u.s. and generally exceed the dialysis outcome quality indicators of the national kidney foundation. in addition, over the past several years our clinical teammate turnover has remained relatively constant and we believe that a relatively stable teammate turnover in 2015 was a major
65
contributor to our continued clinical performance improvements and can also be a major driver of our ability to maintain or improve clinical hours per treatment. we will continue to focus on these three stakeholders and our clinical outcomes as we believe these are fundamental long-term value drivers.
we believe our national scale, size and commitment to our patients, among other things, allows us to provide industry-leading quality care with superior clinical outcomes that attracts patients, referring physicians, and qualified medical directors to our network, which provides our dialysis patient base with a large number of out-patient dialysis centers to choose from with convenient locations and access to a full range of other integrated services which provides us the ability to effectively and efficiently manage a patient's care and certain costs while still maintaining strong legal and compliance programs.
approximately 62% of our 2015 consolidated net revenues were derived directly from our dialysis and related lab services business. approximately 79% of our 2015 dialysis and related lab services revenues were derived from outpatient hemodialysis services in the 2,220 u.s. centers that we consolidate. other dialysis services, which are operationally integrated with our dialysis operations, are peritoneal dialysis, home-based hemodialysis, hospital inpatient hemodialysis services and management and administrative services provided to minority-owned and non-owned dialysis centers. these services collectively accounted for the balance of our 2015 dialysis and related lab services revenues.
the principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are:
·   the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring approximately three treatments per week, as well as, to a lesser extent, the number of treatments for peritoneal dialysis services and home-based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis services; and

·   average dialysis revenue per treatment including the mix of commercial and government patients.

the total patient base is a relatively stable factor, which we believe is influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis services as indicated by the united states renal data system that reported an approximate compound growth rate of 3.6% over the last several years for the dialysis patient population, our relationships with referring physicians, together with the quality of our clinical care which can lead to reduced patient mortality rates as indicated above, and our ability to open and acquire new dialysis centers.
our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment is driven by changes in our mix of commercial and government (principally medicare and medicaid) patients, commercial and government payment rates, our billing and collecting operations performance, and to a lesser extent the mix and intensity of physician-prescribed pharmaceuticals that are separately billable since payment for these pharmaceuticals are primarily included in medicare's single bundled payment rate system and can also be included as part of a single bundled payment rate for all dialysis services provided under some of our commercial contracts.
on average, dialysis-related payment rates from contracted commercial payors are significantly higher than medicare, medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients as a relationship to total patients represents a major driver of our total average dialysis revenue per treatment. the percentage of commercial patients covered under contracted plans as compared to commercial patients with out-of-network providers continued to increase, which can significantly affect our average dialysis revenue per treatment since commercial payment rates for patients with out-of-network providers are on average higher than in-network payment rates that are covered under commercial contracted plans. for the first time in several years, the growth of our commercial patients slightly outpaced the growth of our government-based patients as more of our patients are covered by commercial contracted plans.

government dialysis-related payment rates in the u.s. are principally determined by federal medicare and state medicaid policy. for patients with medicare coverage, all esrd payments for dialysis treatments are made under a single bundled payment rate which provides a fixed payment rate to encompass all goods and services provided during the dialysis treatment, including certain pharmaceuticals, such as epo, vitamin d analogs and iron supplements, irrespective of the level of pharmaceuticals administered to the patient or additional services performed. most lab services are also included in the bundled payment. the bundled payment rate is also adjusted for certain patient characteristics, a geographic usage index and certain other factors.
the bundled payment system presents operating, clinical and financial risks. for example, with regard to the expanded list of case-mix adjustors, there is a risk that our dialysis centers or billing and other systems may not accurately document and track the appropriate patient-specific characteristics, resulting in a reduction or overpayment in the amounts of the payments that we would otherwise be entitled to receive.
an important provision in the law is an annual adjustment, or market basket update, to the esrd pps base rate. absent action by congress, the pps base rate is automatically updated annually by a formulaic inflation adjustment.
in december 2013, cms issued the 2014 final rule for the esrd pps, which phases in the payment reductions mandated by atra, as modified by the "protecting access to medicare act of 2014" which will reduce our market basket inflation adjustment by 1.25% in 2016 and 2017, and 1% in 2018. cms published the 2015 final rule for the esrd pps, which increased payments to dialysis facilities by 0.3% to 0.5%, although rural facilities received a decrease of 0.5%. cms recently issued the 2016 final rule for the esrd pps, which cuts dialysis facilities' bundled payment rate for 2016 as compared to 2015 while increasing funds for certain co-morbidities and other patient health factors, and rural facilities. cms believes its 2016 final rule for the esrd pps will (i) increase overall payments to both hospital-based and freestanding dialysis facilities by approximately 0.2%, and (ii) decrease overall payments to rural dialysis facilities by approximately 0.1%.
as a result of the bca and subsequent activity in congress, a $1.2 trillion sequester (across-the-board spending cuts) in discretionary programs took effect on march 1, 2013. in particular, a 2% reduction to medicare payments took effect on april 1, 2013, which was subsequently extended through 2014 and 2015. the bipartisan budget act of 2015 extended the bca's annual 2% reduction to medicare payments through fiscal year 2025. these across-the-board spending cuts have affected and will continue to adversely affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows.
the innovation center is currently working with various healthcare providers to develop, refine and implement acos and other innovative models of care for medicare and medicaid beneficiaries. we are currently uncertain of the extent to which the long-term operation and evolution of these models of care, including acos, bundled payments for care improvement initiative, cec model (which includes the development of escos), the comprehensive primary care initiative, the duals demonstration, or other models, will impact the healthcare market over time. our u.s. dialysis business may choose to participate in one or several of these models either as a partner with other providers or independently. we currently participate in the cec model with the innovation center, including with organizations in arizona, florida, new jersey and pennsylvania. in areas where davita is not directly participating in this or other innovation center models, some of our patients may be assigned to an aco, another esrd care model, or another program, in which case the quality and cost of care that we furnish will be included in an aco's, another esrd care model's or other programs' calculations. as new models of care emerge and evolve, we may be at risk for losing our medicare patient base, which would have a materially adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flow. other initiatives in the government or private sector also may arise, including the development of models similar to acos, ipas and integrated delivery systems or evolutions of those concepts which could adversely impact our business.
we anticipate that we will continue to experience increases in our operating costs in 2016 that will outpace any net medicare rate increases that we may receive, which could significantly impact our operating results. in addition, we expect to continue experiencing increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation, such as labor and supply costs, regardless of whether there is a compensating inflation-based increase in medicare payment rates or in payments under the bundled payment rate system.
dialysis payment rates from commercial payors can vary and a major portion of our commercial rates are set at contracted amounts with payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. our commercial payment rates also include payments for out-of-network patients that on average are higher than our in-network commercial contract rates. in 2015, we were successful in increasing some of our commercial contracted payment rates which contributed to an increase in our average dialysis revenue per treatment. we continue to enter into some commercial contracts covering certain patients that will primarily pay us a single bundled payment rate for all dialysis services provided to these patients. however, some of the contracts will pay us for certain other services and pharmaceuticals in addition to the bundled payment. we are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors, and if our negotiations result in overall commercial contract payment rate reductions in excess of our commercial contract payment rate increases, our revenues and operating results could be negatively impacted. in addition, if there is an increase in job losses in the u.s., or depending upon changes to the healthcare regulatory system by cms and/or the impact of healthcare insurance exchanges, we could experience a decrease in the number of patients covered under traditional commercial insurance plans. patients with commercial insurance who cannot otherwise maintain coverage frequently rely on financial assistance from charitable
67
organizations, such as the american kidney fund. if these patients are unable to obtain or continue to receive such financial assistance, our revenues, earnings, and cash flows could be substantially reduced.
approximately 2% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015, were from physician-prescribed pharmaceuticals that are separately billable, with epo accounting for approximately 1% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues. the impact of physician-prescribed pharmaceuticals on our overall revenues that are separately billable has significantly decreased since medicare's single bundled payment system went into effect, as well as some additional commercial contracts that pay us a single bundled payment rate.
our operating performance with respect to dialysis services billing and collection can also be a significant factor in the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment we recognize and are able to collect. over the past several years we have invested heavily in upgrades to our systems and internal processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduced our regulatory compliance risks, and we expect to continue to improve these systems and processes. in 2015, we continued to upgrade our information technology systems and implemented process changes. we continue to upgrade our billing and other systems and modify our processes to improve our ability to capture the necessary patient characteristics, co-morbidities and certain other factors under medicare's bundled payment system. we believe this will potentially enable us to capture additional reimbursement amounts from medicare and enhance our overall billing and collection performance. however, as we continue to make upgrades to our systems and processes, or as payors change their systems and requirements, such as changes to medicare's billing codes, we could experience a negative impact to our cash collection performance which would affect our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment.
our dialysis and related lab services revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectability of our billings as of the reporting date based upon our actual historical collection experience. changes in estimates are reflected in the then-current period financial statements based upon on-going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies.
our annual average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment was approximately $348, $342 and $340 for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. in 2015, the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment increased by approximately $6 per treatment due to an increase in our average commercial payment rates and improvements in our commercial payor mix, partially offset by an increase in our provision for uncollectible accounts. in 2014, the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment increased by approximately $2 per treatment primarily from the recognition of certain california medicaid revenue that was previously reserved, an increase in some of our commercial payment rates, partially offset by changes in our commercial payor mix.
our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment can be significantly impacted by several major factors, including our commercial payment rates; government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments covered under medicare's bundled payment rate system, including our ability to capture certain patient characteristics; changes in the mix of government and commercial patients and the number of commercial patients that are either covered under commercial contracts or are out of network.
the principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, utilization levels of pharmaceuticals, business infrastructure costs, which include the operating costs of our dialysis centers, and certain professional fees. however, other cost categories can also represent significant cost variability, such as employee benefit costs, payroll taxes, insurance costs and medical supply costs. our average clinical hours per treatment or productivity levels in 2015 improved slightly compared to 2014, which was primarily the result of improvements in our internal procedures and processes. we are always striving for improved productivity levels, however, changes in federal and state policies or regulatory billing requirements can lead to increased labor costs in order to implement these new requirements, which can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. in addition, improvements in the u.s. economy have stimulated additional competition for skilled clinical personnel resulting in slightly higher teammate turnover in 2015, which we believe negatively affected productivity levels. in 2015 and 2014, we experienced an increase in our clinical labor rates of approximately 0.9% and 1.5%, respectively, as clinical labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends, mainly due to the high demand for skilled clinical personnel, along with general inflation increases. in 2015, we experienced a significant increase in our pharmaceutical unit costs. we also continue to experience increases in our infrastructure and operating costs of our dialysis centers, primarily due to the number of new dialysis centers opened, and general increases in rent, utilities and repairs and maintenance. however, in 2015, we continued to implement certain cost control initiatives to manage our overall operating costs, including labor productivity.
68
our dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses represented 8.2% and 8.3% of our dialysis and related lab services net revenues in 2015 and 2014, respectively. the slight decrease was primarily due to a decrease in professional fees for compliance matters and information technology initiatives and lower travel expenses, partially offset by higher labor and benefit costs and long-term incentive compensation. increases in general and administrative expenses over the last several years primarily related to strengthening our dialysis business, improving our regulatory compliance and other operational processes, responding to certain legal and compliance matters, and professional fees associated with enhancing our information technology systems. we expect that these levels of expenditures on our dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses will continue in 2016 and could possibly increase as we seek out new business opportunities within the dialysis industry and continue to invest in improving our information technology infrastructure and the level of support required for our regulatory compliance and legal matters.

per treatment net revenues dialysis and related lab services net revenues for 2015 increased by approximately $431 million, or 5.2%, from 2014. the increase in net revenues was primarily due to solid volume growth from additional treatments of approximately 4.0% due to an increase in non-acquired treatment growth at existing and new dialysis centers and an increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $6. the increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2015, as compared to 2014, was due to an increase in our average commercial payment rates and improvements in our commercial payor mix. dialysis and related lab services net revenues were negatively impacted by an increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts of $53 million.
dialysis and related lab services net revenues for 2014 increased by approximately $447 million, or 5.8%, from 2013. the increase in net revenues was primarily due to strong volume growth from additional treatments of approximately 5.7% due to an increase in non-acquired treatment growth at existing and new dialysis centers and growth through acquisitions of dialysis centers and an increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $2. the increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2014, as compared to 2013, was due to the recognition of certain california medicaid revenue that was previously reserved, an increase in some of our commercial payment rates, partially offset by changes in the commercial payor mix. dialysis and related lab services net revenues were negatively impacted by an increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts of $72 million.

the following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues by modality for the year ended december 31, 2015:
revenue

modality                                              percentages outpatient hemodialysis centers                                79   %
peritoneal dialysis and home-based hemodialysis                16   %
hospital inpatient hemodialysis                                 5   %
total dialysis and related lab services' revenues             100   %
approximately 66% of our total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015 were from government-based programs, principally medicare, medicaid, and medicare-assigned plans, representing approximately 89% of our total patients. prior to 2015, we had experienced growth in our government-based patients that had been outpacing the growth in our commercial patients which had negatively impacted our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment since we receive higher reimbursement rates from our commercial payors. however, in 2015, for the first time in several years, the growth of our commercial patients slightly outpaced the growth of our government-based patients as more of our patients are covered by commercial contracted plans. less than 1% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are due directly from patients. there is no single commercial payor associated with our dialysis and related lab services business that accounted for more than 10% of total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015.
on average, dialysis-related payment rates from contracted commercial payors are significantly higher than medicare, medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients as a relationship to total patients represents a major driver of our total average dialysis revenue per treatment. for a patient covered by a commercial insurance plan, medicare generally becomes the primary payor after 33 months, which includes the three month waiting period, or earlier if the patient's commercial insurance plan coverage terminates. when medicare becomes the primary payor, the payment rates we receive for that patient shifts from the commercial insurance plan rates to medicare payment rates, which are significantly lower than commercial insurance rates. medicare payment rates are insufficient to cover our costs associated with providing dialysis services, and therefore we lose money on each medicare treatment that we provide.
nearly all of our net earnings from our dialysis and related lab services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at established contract rates and others which pay negotiated payment rates based on our usual and customary fee schedule for our out-of-network patients, which are typically higher than commercial contracted rates. if we experience a net overall reduction in our contracted and non-contracted commercial payment rates as a result of negotiations, restrictions or changes to the healthcare regulatory system, including the potential impact of healthcare insurance exchanges, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
operating expenses and charges patient care costs. dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and consist principally of labor, benefits, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and other operating costs of the dialysis centers. the dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were $221 and $219 for 2015 and 2014, respectively. the $2 increase in the per treatment costs in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to higher overall pharmaceutical costs due to higher pharmaceutical unit costs, an increase in our other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers, and a slight increase in labor costs, partially offset by improvements in productivity, and lower general and professional insurance costs.
the dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were $219 and $216 for 2014 and 2013, respectively. the $3 increase in the per treatment costs in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily attributable to higher overall pharmaceutical costs due to an increase in intensities of physician-prescribed pharmaceuticals and higher pharmaceutical unit costs, an increase in our other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers, and a slight increase in labor costs, partially offset by improvements in productivity and lower general and professional insurance costs.
general and administrative expenses. dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses in 2015 increased by approximately $27 million as compared to 2014. the increase was primarily due to an increase in our labor and benefit costs and long-term compensation costs.
70
dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses in 2014 decreased by approximately $24 million as compared to 2013. the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our professional expenses for legal and compliance matters and for information technology initiatives, a decrease in labor costs and related payroll taxes, a decrease in travel expenses for management meetings, and the write-off of certain obsolete software costs that occurred in 2013, partially offset by higher long-term incentive compensation.
depreciation and amortization. dialysis and related lab services depreciation and amortization expenses for 2015 increased by approximately $35 million as compared to 2014 and increased by $47 million in 2014 as compared to 2013. the increases were primarily due to both growth through new dialysis center developments and additional informational technology initiatives.
provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable for u.s. dialysis and related lab services was 4.5% for 2015, 4.1% for 2014, and 3.5% for 2013. the increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable in 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to higher write-offs of medicare secondary billings. we currently expect the 2015 level of the provision for uncollectible accounts to continue into 2016, although it may increase if we encounter any collection issues.
settlement charge. in june 2015, we finalized the terms of the settlement agreement with plaintiffs regarding the vainer private civil suit, which includes a settlement amount of $450 million and attorney fees and other costs of $45 million.
equity investment income. equity investment income was approximately $15 million, $14 million and $12 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increases in equity investment income in 2015 and 2014 were primarily due to the profitability of certain of our dialysis nonconsolidated joint ventures.
segment operating income dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2015 decreased by approximately $378 million as compared to 2014, which includes a settlement charge of $495 million in 2015 and a loss contingency accrual of $17 million in 2014. excluding these items from their respective periods, dialysis and related lab services adjusted operating income for 2015 would have increased by $100 million. the increase in the adjusted operating income for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to solid treatment growth as a result of additional dialysis treatments and an increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $6, as described above. in addition, dialysis and related lab services adjusted operating income also increased due to improved productivity and lower general and professional insurance costs, partially offset by higher overall pharmaceutical costs, as described above, and an increase in our provision for uncollectible accounts of $53 million.
dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2014 increased by approximately $438 million as compared to 2013, which includes loss contingency accruals of $17 million and $397 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. excluding these items from their respective periods, dialysis and related lab services adjusted operating income would have increased by $58 million. the increase in the adjusted operating income for 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to strong treatment growth as a result of additional dialysis treatments from non-acquired growth and acquisitions of dialysis centers, and an increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $2 as described above. in addition, dialysis and related lab services adjusted operating income also increased due to a decrease in professional expenses, the write-off of certain obsolete software costs that occurred in 2013 and improved productivity. dialysis and related lab services adjusted operating income was negatively impacted by higher overall pharmaceutical costs as described above and an increase in our provision for uncollectible accounts of $72 million.
hcp business hcp is a patient- and physician-focused, integrated healthcare delivery and management company with over two decades of experience providing coordinated, outcomes-based medical care in a cost-effective manner. as of december 31, 2015, hcp had approximately 807,400 members under its care in southern california, colorado, central and south florida, southern nevada, central new mexico and central arizona through capitation contracts with some of the nation's leading health plans. of these 807,400 members, approximately 317,400 individuals were patients enrolled in medicare advantage, and the remaining approximately 490,000 individuals were managed care members whose health coverage is provided through their employer or who have individually acquired health coverage directly from a health plan or as a result of their eligibility for medicaid benefits. in addition to its managed care business, during the year ended december 31, 2015, hcp provided care in all markets to over 612,100 patients whose health coverage is structured on a ffs basis, including patients enrolled through traditional medicare and medicaid programs, preferred provider organizations and other third party payors.
hcp's patients as well as the patients of hcp's associated physicians, physician groups and ipas benefit from an integrated approach to medical care that places the physician at the center of patient care. as of december 31, 2015, hcp delivered services to its members via a network of approximately 547 associated full-time primary care physicians, over 2,900 associated groups and other network primary care physicians, 240 network hospitals, and several thousand associated group and network specialists. together with
71
hundreds of case managers, registered nurses and other care coordinators, these medical professionals utilize a comprehensive information technology system, sophisticated risk management techniques and clinical protocols to provide high-quality, cost-effective care to hcp's members. the total amount of revenue from hcp for the year ended december 31, 2015, was approximately $3.837 billion, or approximately 27.8% of our consolidated net revenues.
key financial measures and indicators operating revenues hcp's consolidated revenues consist primarily of capitated revenues, including revenues attributable to capitated contracts with health plans and, to a lesser extent, revenues from patient services rendered and other operating revenues, each as described in more detail below.
hcp capitated revenues consist primarily of fees for medical services provided under capitated contracts with various health plans or under ffs arrangements with privately insured individuals. capitation revenue derived from health plans typically results from either (i) premium payments by cms to hcp's health plan customers under medicare advantage with respect to seniors, disabled and other eligible persons (which are referred to herein as hcp's senior membership), (ii) premium payments by state governments to hcp's health plan customers under medicaid managed care programs (which are referred to herein as hcp's medicaid membership), and (iii) premium payments from public and private employers and individuals to hcp's health plan customers with respect to their employees (which are referred to herein as hcp's commercial membership). capitation payments under health plan contracts are made monthly based on the number of enrollees selecting an hcp associated group physician employed or associated with one of hcp's medical group entities as their primary healthcare provider. the amount of monthly capitation hcp receives from health plans on behalf of a member generally does not vary during a given calendar year, regardless of the level of actual medical services utilized by the member. as described in more detail below, in central florida, southern nevada and arizona, hcp principally utilizes a global capitation model in which it assumes the financial responsibility for both professional (physician) and institutional (or hospital) services for covered benefits, whereas in new mexico, hcp assumes the financial responsibility for professional services only. in southern california, hcp utilizes variants of a different model for capitation under which it is directly financially responsible for covered professional services, but indirectly financially responsible for covered institutional expenses. see below for further discussion regarding changes to hcp's revenue recognition for hospital services. hcp's associated medical groups also receive specified incentive payments from health plans based on specified performance and quality criteria. these amounts are accrued when earned, and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.
·   global capitation model. hcp records the aggregate global capitation pmpm fee as revenue and the amounts paid with respect to claims as medical expenses or hospital expenses, as applicable, in its combined financial statements (see "patient care costs-medical expenses" and "operating expenses-hospital expenses" below). revenue with respect to both professional and institutional capitation is recorded in the month in which enrollees are entitled to receive healthcare. in hcp's central florida market, hcp also receives capitation revenue and is liable for corresponding expenses for prescription drug activity rendered on behalf of hcp's senior members through the part d component under the medicare advantage program.

·   risk-sharing model. as compensation under its various managed care-related administrative services agreements with hospitals, hcp is entitled to receive a percentage of the amount by which the institutional capitation revenue received from health plans exceeds institutional expenses, and any such risk-share amount to which hcp is entitled is recorded as medical revenues. in addition, pursuant to such managed care-related administrative services agreements, hcp agrees to be responsible should the third party incur institutional expenses in excess of institutional capitation revenue. as with global capitation, revenue with respect to professional capitation is reported in the month in which enrollees are entitled to receive healthcare. however, risk-share revenues (that is, the portion of the excess or deficit of institutional capitation revenue to which hcp is entitled less institutional expenses), in contrast, are based on the number of enrollees and estimates of institutional utilization and associated costs incurred by assigned health plan enrollees, and the amounts accrued when earned can be reasonably estimated. differences between actual contract settlements and estimated receivables and payables are recorded in the year of final settlement. in december 2013, hcp obtained a restricted knox-keene license in california, which permits hcp to enter into global capitation agreements with health plans that allow hcp to assume financial responsibility for both professional and institutional services. hcp is in the process of evaluating and identifying which risk-sharing arrangements, if any, will be converted to global capitation arrangements, subject to hcp's and the applicable health plan's satisfactory negotiation and approval, as well as approval from the department of managed healthcare. completion of such evaluation and possible conversion is expected to occur over time.

72
·   retroactive revenue-adjustments. the medicare advantage revenue received by hcp's health plan customers is adjusted periodically to give effect to the relative clinical and demographic profile of the members for whom hcp is financially responsible. the model employed by cms bases a portion of the total reimbursement payments on various clinical and demographic factors, including hospital inpatient diagnoses, additional diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings, hospital outpatient department and physician visits, gender, age and medicaid eligibility. cms requires that all managed care companies capture, collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms twice a year for reconciliation with cms's internal database. capitation payments under this methodology are paid at interim rates during the year and retroactive adjustments occur in subsequent periods (generally in the third quarter of the same year, with a final adjustment in the third quarter of the following year) after the data is compiled by cms. hcp estimates the amount of the current year adjustments in revenues during the first and second quarters of any given year and adjusts its estimates during the third quarter, upon receipt of payments from cms. differences between actual contract settlements and estimated revenues are recorded in the year of final settlement. to date, all such adjustments have resulted in increases in revenue.

·   patient service revenues. patient service revenues are recorded when the services are provided. such revenues are based on a negotiated fixed-fee schedule with the applicable health plan.

·   other operating revenues. in addition to the revenues discussed above, other operating revenues primarily represents, (i) management fees hcp receives with respect to its role as the manager of its unconsolidated joint ventures, (ii) revenues from the maintenance of existing physicians' networks, (iii) revenues recognized under meaningful use programs established by federal and state governments which provide financial incentives for providers to implement and utilize electronic health record technology to improve patient care, and (iv) medical consulting revenues.

patient care costs hcp's largest patient care costs are the costs of medical services provided pursuant to its capitation contracts, which consist of medical expenses, hospital expenses and clinical support and other operating costs, as further described below. under both the global capitation and the risk-share capitation models, costs of medical services are recognized in the month in which the related services are provided. in addition, medical expenses and hospital expenses include an estimate of such expenses that have been incurred but not yet reported. for further information on how hcp estimates such claims, see "critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments-medical liability claims associated with hcp" below.
medical expenses. medical expenses consist of payments for professional and ancillary services to independent primary care physicians, specialists, ancillary providers and hospitals (including, with respect to hospitals, for outpatient services) pursuant to agreements with those entities. the structure of such expenses can consist of, among other things, sub-capitation and ffs payments. in addition, medical expenses include compensation and related expenses incurred with respect to hcp's associated group primary care physicians and specialists, registered nurses, physician assistants and hospitalists.
hospital expenses. hospital expenses consist of payments for institutional services to contracted and non-contracted hospitals for both inpatient and outpatient services, skilled nursing facilities, and to other institutional providers. hospital expenses are only incurred in connection with the services hcp provides in florida, nevada and arizona. in those regions, as described above, hcp enters into contracts with health plans pursuant to which it assumes the risk for institutional hospital services. in contrast in california, hcp's medical groups were not permitted to contract with health plans to directly assume the risk for institutional services. accordingly, the risk-share revenue that hcp records in california is net of reported claims and estimates of hospital utilization and associated costs incurred by assigned health plan enrollees, and no portion of institutional hospital costs incurred with respect to hcp's california operations is included in hospital expenses as presented. however, as a result of hcp obtaining a restricted knox-keene license in december 2013 as discussed above, hcp may now assume the risk for institutional services in california.
clinic support and other operating costs. clinic support and other operating costs primarily consist of the costs incurred with respect to compensation of administrative and other support staff employed at hcp's medical clinics, clinic rent and utilities, medical supplies and other direct costs incurred to support clinic operations.
other operating expenses general and administrative. general and administrative expenses are those costs directly related to corporate administrative functions in supporting hcp and consist primarily of salaries and benefits, professional fees and occupancy costs.
73
equity investment income. hcpamg is a 50% owner of the magan joint venture with the magan medical clinic, inc. hcp also owns a 67% ownership interest in cmgi. hcp is a 50% owner of a joint venture with independence blue cross, tandigm health, llc, and is also a 50% owner of fullwell, llc, a joint venture with centura health corporation. we account for these equity investment interests under the equity method of accounting, meaning that their assets and liabilities are not consolidated with ours, but we recognize our pro rata ownership share of the entities' earnings as equity investment income.

in addition to the members above, hcp provided healthcare services to members in two of its operating unconsolidated joint ventures that are accounted for as equity investments. these joint ventures provided healthcare services for approximately 131,000, 45,700 and 45,100 members as of december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and for approximately 1,564,200, 538,000 and 557,000 member months as of december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increase in members and member months was due to tandigm health beginning operations in 2015.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, hcp members decreased by approximately 29,900 and member months increased approximately 62,400. the decrease in members is due to a planned reduction in medicaid members and a decline in commercial members as employers shift to less expensive options for medical services for their employees, partially offset by an increase in senior members due to non-acquired growth. the increase in member months was primarily attributable to an increase in senior members resulting from non-acquired growth, new acquisitions and an increase in medicaid members due to medicaid expansion. this increase in member months was partially offset by a planned non-renewal of certain plans in certain markets due to unfavorable economics.
74
during the year ended december 31, 2014, hcp members and member months increased by approximately 72,800 and 792,800, respectively. the increases in members and member months were primarily attributable to an increase in senior members resulting from non-acquired growth, new acquisitions and an increase in medicaid members due to medicaid expansion, partially offset by a decline in commercial members.

net revenues hcp's net revenue for 2015 increased $335 million, or 9.6%, primarily driven by an increase in ffs revenue from acquisitions, an increase in senior capitated revenue due to an increase in the number of senior capitated members during the year that is attributable to non-acquired growth and acquisitions, an increase in medicaid memberships due to medicaid expansion, recognition of additional medicaid risk-share revenue due to decreased costs related to lower claims, as well as higher commercial negotiated rates for commercial members. these increases in net revenues are partially offset by a decrease in senior capitated revenues due to the planned non-renewal of some plans due to unfavorable economics in certain markets.
hcp's net revenue for 2014 increased $306 million, or 9.6%, primarily driven by an increase in the number of senior capitated members during the year due to organic growth and acquisitions, an increase in medicaid memberships due to medicaid expansion and recognition of additional hcp revenue related to the maintenance of existing physician networks, partially offset by a decline in medicare advantage reimbursement rates, and a decline in the number of commercial members to whom hcp provides healthcare services.
on april 6, 2015, cms issued final guidance for 2016 medicare advantage rates, which incorporated a modification to the risk adjustment model calculation that cms utilizes to determine the risk acuity scores of medicare advantage patients. we estimate that the final cumulative impact of the 2016 rate structure will represent a decrease of approximately 2.0% of hcp's average medicare advantage revenues it manages on behalf of its senior capitated population as compared to 2015, which compares to the industry average rate increase of approximately 1.25% as indicated by cms.
the more significant decline in medicare advantage rates for hcp compared to the industry average is driven by a larger-than-average decline associated with cms's modification to the risk adjustment model calculations. the full implementation of the 2014 cms-hcc risk adjustment model negatively affects hcp and other providers like us who have invested more heavily in wellness and prevention programs for patients with chronic conditions.

operating expenses patient care costs. hcp's patient care costs for 2015 increased by approximately $210 million from 2014. the increase was primarily attributable to increases in medical claim expenses and hospital expenses due to increases in senior and medicaid member months from acquisitions, non-acquired growth, medicaid expansion, as well as market expansion and the timing of the recognition of additional benefit expense related to higher medicaid risk sharing revenues. the increase was also driven by an increase in clinic support costs due to acquisitions. the increase in costs was partially offset by a decrease in commercial members to whom hcp provides healthcare services and a decrease in costs due to the planned non-renewal of some plans due to unfavorable economics in certain markets.
hcp's patient care costs for 2014 increased by approximately $391 million from 2013. the increase was primarily attributable to increases in medical claim expenses and hospital expenses due to increases in senior and medicaid memberships from acquisitions, non-acquired growth, medicaid expansion, and an increase in utilization. the increase was also driven by an increase in clinic support costs due to acquisitions.
general and administrative expenses. hcp's general and administrative costs for 2015 increased $90 million from 2014. the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in corporate administrative support costs related to growth initiatives, professional fees, recognition of additional compensation expense, and travel costs.
hcp's general and administrative costs for 2014 increased $61 million from 2013. the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in corporate administrative support departments to accommodate additional acquisitions during 2014, an increase in utilization of professional services related to it infrastructure projects and management bonuses related to retention of key personnel.
depreciation and amortization. hcp's depreciation and amortization for 2015 increased $4 million from 2014. the increase is primarily attributable to depreciation and amortization of assets associated with acquisitions.
hcp's depreciation and amortization for 2014 increased $11 million from 2013. the increase is primarily attributable to depreciation and amortization of assets associated with acquisitions.
goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges. during the quarter ended december 31, 2015, we determined that circumstances indicated it had become more likely than not that the goodwill and an indefinite-lived intangible asset of certain hcp reporting units had become impaired. these circumstances included underperformance of the business in recent quarters, as well as changes in other market conditions, including government reimbursement cuts and our expected ability to mitigate them. we are performing the required valuation of these reporting units and have estimated the fair value of their net assets and implied goodwill with the assistance of a third-party valuation firm. based on the current assessments, we recorded an estimated $206 million in goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges. the final amount of these impairment charges will depend upon the final outcome of this valuation work, which we expect will be completed in the first quarter of 2016.
equity investment income. hcp's share of equity investment income from our unconsolidated joint venture relationships for 2015 decreased $6 million from 2014. the decrease in equity income is primarily attributable to our share of expenses from a certain newly formed joint venture that provides integrated healthcare and reduced commercial risk pool performance.
hcp's share of equity investment income from our joint venture relationships for 2014 decreased $13 million from 2013. the decrease in equity income is primarily attributable to our share of initial expenses of a newly formed joint venture and increased professional capitation costs related to our other joint venture.
76
segment operating income hcp's operating income for 2015 decreased $181 million, including estimated goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $206 million in 2015 related to certain reporting units. excluding the impairment charges from 2015, adjusted hcp operating income for the year ended december 31, 2015 would have increased by approximately $25 million, or 11.6%. the increase in adjusted hcp operating income was primarily attributable to an increase in ffs revenue from acquisitions and non-acquired growth, an increase in medicaid members due to medicaid expansion, the timing of recognition of additional medicare risk share revenue and a reduction of claims expense due to the planned non-renewal of some plans due to unfavorable economics in certain markets. this increase was partially offset by a decrease in commercial members, and higher general and administrative costs.
hcp's operating income for 2014 decreased $170 million. the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in medicare advantage rates, a decrease in commercial memberships and higher medical expenses, partially offset by an increase in medicare and medicaid revenues due to increases in senior capitated members from acquisitions and medicaid expansion.
other-ancillary services and strategic initiatives business our other operations include ancillary services and strategic initiatives which are primarily aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our network of patients. as of december 31, 2015, these consisted primarily of pharmacy services, disease management services, vascular access services, clinical research programs, physician services, direct primary care and our international dialysis operations. the ancillary services and strategic initiatives generated approximately $1.382 billion of net revenues in 2015, representing approximately 10% of our consolidated net revenues. we currently expect to continue to invest in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives including our continued expansion into certain international markets as we work to develop successful new business operations. however, any significant change in market conditions, business performance or in the regulatory environment may impact the economic viability of any of these strategic initiatives. any unfavorable changes in these strategic initiatives could result in a write-off or an impairment of some or all of our investments, including goodwill, and could also result in significant termination costs if we were to exit a certain line of business or one or more of our international markets.
as of december 31, 2015, we provided dialysis and administrative services to a total of 118 outpatient dialysis centers located in ten countries outside of the u.s., and we owned a minority equity investment in a primary care and multi-specialty chain in india. our international dialysis operations are still in an early phase of development as we primarily commenced operations during the fourth quarter of 2011. the total net revenues generated from our international operations, as reflected below, were approximately 1% of our 2015 consolidated net revenues.
the following table reflects the results of operations for the ancillary services and strategic initiatives:

net revenues the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues for 2015 increased by approximately $243 million, or 21.3%, as compared to 2014. the increase was primarily related to an increase in pharmacy services volume and pharmaceutical rates, as well as an increase in net revenues from growth in our international business and other strategic initiatives. these increases were partially offset by an increase in reserves for refunds of prior period pharmacy reimbursements.
77
the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues for 2014 increased by approximately $287 million, or 33.7%, as compared to 2013, primarily from growth in prescriptions dispensed, increases in other pharmacy services revenue and growth in our international operations.
operating expenses ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2015 increased by approximately $322 million from 2014 which includes an estimated accrual for damages and liabilities associated with our pharmacy business of $22 million, as well as a goodwill impairment charge of $4 million related to one of our international reporting units during the second quarter of 2015. excluding these items from 2015, the ancillary services and strategic initiatives adjusted operating expenses would have increased by $296 million. the increase in adjusted operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in prescription dispensing volume, higher pharmaceutical costs, higher labor costs and related payroll taxes and benefit costs, additional expenses associated with our international dialysis expansion, and an increase in costs associated with the right to use intellectual property and general and administrative and corporate administrative support expenses.
ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2014 increased by approximately $273 million from 2013. the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in prescription dispensing volume and costs in our pharmacy business, an increase in expenses associated with our international dialysis expansion into europe, middle east, south america and asia pacific, higher labor costs and related payroll taxes, an increase in benefit costs and an increase in business related licensing and the right to use newly developed intellectual property and corporate administrative support expenses.
operating loss ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2015 increased by approximately $79 million from 2014 which includes an estimated accrual for damages and liabilities of $22 million, as well as a goodwill impairment charge of $4 million related to our international operations during the second quarter of 2015. excluding these items from 2015, the ancillary services and strategic initiatives adjusted operating losses would have increased by $53 million. this increase in adjusted operating losses was primarily due to an increase in drug prescription costs associated with our pharmacy business, higher labor costs, increases in expenses related to our international expansion, an increase in costs associated with the right to use intellectual property and an increase in general and administrative costs. the increase in adjusted operating losses was partially offset by an increase in net revenue in our pharmacy business, primarily from additional volume and increases in pharmaceutical rates.
ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2014 decreased by approximately $14 million from 2013. this decrease in operating losses was primarily due to improved operating performance of our pharmacy business related to increased prescriptions dispensed and pharmacy services rendered, partially offset by an increase in labor costs and related payroll taxes, an increase in benefit costs and an increase in costs associated with international dialysis expansion.
corporate level charges debt expense. debt expense for 2015, 2014, and 2013 consisted of interest expense of approximately $390 million, $386 million, and $401 million, respectively, and the amortization and accretion of debt discounts and premiums, the amortization of deferred financing costs and the amortization of interest rate cap agreements of approximately $18 million in 2015, $25 million in 2014 and $29 million in 2013. the increase in debt expense in 2015 as compared to 2014, was primarily related to an increase in weighted average outstanding principal balances offset by lower weighted average interest rates as a result of the issuance of our 5.0% senior notes in april 2015, as well as the entry into a new credit agreement and the issuance of senior notes in june 2014, as discussed below. our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2015 was 4.42% as compared to 4.68% in 2014.
the decrease in debt expense in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily related to our credit agreement issued in june 2014, as well as the issuance of our 5 1⁄8% senior notes that were entered into in the second quarter of 2014 that contain lower weighted average interest rates and from lower average interest rates associated with the unhedged portion of term loan a. our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2014 was 4.68% as compared to 4.84% in 2013.
other income. other income was approximately $9 million, $2 million, and $5 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, and consisted principally of interest income. other income increased in 2015 as compared to 2014 due to an increase in short-term investment interest income and a decrease in foreign currency transaction losses. other income in 2014 decreased from 2013, primarily as a result of the impact of certain foreign currency transactions, partially offset by an increase in short-term investment interest income.
78
provision for income taxes. the provision for income taxes for 2015 represented an effective annualized tax rate of 40.9%, compared with 34.1% and 33.9% of income from continuing operations in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the effective tax rate in 2015 was higher primarily due to the impairment of goodwill in 2015.
noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2015, 2014 and 2013 was approximately $158 million, $140 million and $124 million, respectively. the increases in noncontrolling interests in 2015 and 2014 were primarily due to increases in the number of new joint ventures and increases in the profitability of our dialysis-related joint ventures. the percentage of u.s. dialysis and related lab services net revenues generated from dialysis-related joint ventures was approximately 23%, 22% and 21% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
accounts receivable our u.s. dialysis and related lab services accounts receivable balances at december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 were $1.255 billion and $1.157 billion, respectively, representing approximately 53 days and 50 days of revenue, respectively, net of bad debt provision. the increase in day sales outstanding (dso) for the u.s. dialysis and related lab services business, was primarily the result of the continued rollout of our billing system in 2015, as well as improved cash collection performance in 2014 that positively impacted the dso in 2014 which we did not experience in 2015. our dso calculation is based on the current quarter's average revenues per day.
as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, our dialysis and related lab services unreserved accounts receivable balances that were more than six months old were approximately $233 million and $152 million, respectively, representing approximately 18% and 13% of our dialysis accounts receivable balances, respectively. there were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. less than 1% of our revenues are classified as patient pay. substantially all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors, as discussed above.
amounts pending approval from third-party payors as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, other than the standard monthly billing, consisted of approximately $106 million in 2015 and $119 million in 2014, associated with medicare bad debt claims, classified as other receivables. currently, a significant portion of our medicare bad debt claims are typically paid to us before the medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims. however, the payment received from medicare is subject to adjustment based upon the actual results of the audits. such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed. as a kidney dialysis provider, our revenue is not subject to cost report settlements, except for potentially limiting the collectability of these medicare bad debt claims.
liquidity and capital resources available liquidity. as of december 31, 2015, our cash balance was $1.5 billion and we also had approximately $408 million in short-term investments. we also had an undrawn revolving line of credit under our senior secured credit facilities totaling $1.0 billion, of which approximately $92.2 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. in addition, hcp has an outstanding letter of credit of approximately $1.3 million that is secured by a certificate of deposit. we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity, operating cash flows and access to borrowings to fund our scheduled debt service payments and other obligations for the foreseeable future. our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings.
cash flow from operations during 2015 amounted to $1.6 billion, compared with $1.5 billion for 2014. the increase in our operating cash flows in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the timing of other working capital items, a decrease in our income tax payments and a reduction in our net settlement payments and charges, offset by an increase in our cash interest payments. cash flow from operations in 2015 included cash interest payments of approximately $405 million and cash tax payments of $156 million. cash flow from operations in 2014 included cash interest payments of approximately $352 million and cash tax payments of $239 million.
non-operating cash outflows in 2015 included $708 million for capital asset expenditures, including $381 million for new center developments and relocations, and $327 million for maintenance and information technology. we also spent an additional $97 million for acquisitions. during 2015, we also received $1.6 billion from the maturity and sale of investments. however, some of these proceeds were either used to repurchase other investments or were used to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. in addition, during 2015, we received $54 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits. we also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $175 million, and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $55 million associated with new joint ventures and from additional equity contributions. we also repurchased a total of 7,779,958 shares of our common stock for $575 million, or an average price of $73.96 per share, of which $25 million was unsettled at december 31, 2015.
79
non-operating cash outflows in 2014 included $641 million for capital asset expenditures, including $376 million for new center developments and relocations, and $265 million for maintenance and information technology. we also spent an additional $272 million for acquisitions. during 2014, we also received $144 million from the maturity and sale of investments. however, some of these proceeds were either used to repurchase other investments or were used to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. in addition, during 2014, we received $65 million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits. we also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $149 million, and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $65 million associated with new joint ventures and from additional equity contributions. we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in 2014.
on august 17, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire colorado-based renal ventures limited, llc (renal ventures), including a 100% interest in all dialysis centers owned by renal ventures, for approximately $415 million in cash, subject to, among other things, adjustments for certain items such as working capital. renal ventures currently operates 36 dialysis clinics in six states serving approximately 2,400 patients, and also operates other ancillary businesses. the transaction is subject to approval by the federal trade commission (ftc) including hart-scott-rodino antitrust clearance. we anticipate that we will be required by the ftc to divest a certain number of outpatient dialysis centers as a condition of the transaction. we currently expect this transaction to close in 2016.
on november 23, 2015, we entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire the everett clinic medical group (tec), a washington state physician group, for approximately $385 million in cash, subject to, among other things, adjustments for certain items such as working capital. tec has 500 providers in primary and specialty care locations throughout snohomish county, washington who care for more than 315,000 patients. we currently expect this transaction to close in early 2016.
during 2015, we opened 72 new u.s. dialysis centers, acquired a total of six u.s. dialysis centers, sold one center, merged five centers, added two centers in which we operate under a management and administrative services agreement and closed two centers. outside the u.s., we acquired 21 dialysis centers, opened seven new dialysis and hospital operated centers, and terminated one management and administration services agreement.
during 2015, our hcp business acquired three family practices, one management services organization, two primary care practices, and six private medical practices.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we made mandatory principal payments under our senior secured credit facilities totaling $50 million on the term loan a and $35 million on the term loan b.
during 2014, we opened 105 new u.s. dialysis centers, acquired a total of 18 u.s. dialysis centers, sold one center, merged 16 centers and closed one center. outside the u.s., we acquired seven dialysis centers, opened 11 new dialysis and hospital operated centers, closed two dialysis centers and added a net two centers in which we operate under management and administration services agreements. during 2014, our hcp business acquired a family practice, a management services organization, two primary care practices, and eight private medical practices.
debt transactions in april 2015, we issued $1.5 billion 5.0% senior notes due 2025 (5.0% senior notes). the 5.0% senior notes pay interest on may 1 and november 1 of each year beginning november 1, 2015. the 5.0% senior notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. the 5.0% senior notes are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries. we may redeem up to 35% of the 5.0% senior notes at any time prior to may 1, 2018 at a certain specified price from the proceeds of one or more equity offerings. in addition, we may redeem some or all of the 5.0% senior notes at any time prior to may 1, 2020 at make whole redemption rates and on or after such date at certain specified redemption prices. the net proceeds from the 5.0% senior notes offering were used to repurchase all of the outstanding $775 million aggregate principal amount of 6 5⁄8% senior notes due 2020 (6 5⁄8% senior notes) through a combination of a tender offer and a redemption process and to pay fees and expenses. the remaining net offering proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, future acquisitions and share repurchases. as a result of these transactions, we incurred $48 million in debt redemption charges consisting of tender and redemption premiums as well as the write-off of deferred financing fees associated with the repurchase of the 6 5⁄8% senior notes.
80
interest rate swap and cap agreements as of december 31, 2015, we maintain several interest rate swap agreements that were entered into in march 2013 with amortizing notional amounts of these swap agreements totaling $760 million. these agreements have the economic effect of modifying the libor variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our term loan a to fixed rates ranging from 0.49% to 0.52%, resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of 2.26%, including the term loan a margin of 1.75%. the overall weighted average effective interest rate also includes the effects of $165 million of unhedged term loan a debt that bears interest at libor plus an interest rate margin of 1.75%. the swap agreements expire on september 30, 2016 and require monthly interest payments. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recognized debt expense of $2.7 million from these swaps. as of december 31, 2015, the total fair value of these swap agreements was a net asset of approximately $0.5 million. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded a loss of $4.0 million in other comprehensive income due to a decrease in the unrealized fair value of these swap agreements. we estimate that approximately $0.5 million of existing unrealized pre-tax gains in other comprehensive income at december 31, 2015 will be reclassified into income over the next twelve months.
as of december 31, 2015, we maintain several forward interest rate cap agreements that were entered into in october 2015 with notional amounts totaling $3.5 billion. these forward cap agreements will be effective june 29, 2018 and will have the economic effect of capping the libor variable component of our interest rate at a maximum of 3.50% on an equivalent amount of our debt. these cap agreements expire on june 30, 2020. as of december 31, 2015, the total fair value of these cap agreements was an asset of approximately $13.8 million. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded a loss of $3.5 million in other comprehensive income due to a decrease in the unrealized fair value of these cap agreements.
as of december 31, 2015, we maintain several forward interest rate cap agreements that were entered into in november 2014 with notional amounts totaling $3.5 billion. these forward cap agreements will be effective september 30, 2016 and will have the economic effect of capping the libor variable component of our interest rate at a maximum of 3.50% on an equivalent amount of our debt. the cap agreements expire on june 30, 2018. as of december 31, 2015, the total fair value of these cap agreements was an asset of approximately $1.3 million. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded a loss of $11.0 million in other comprehensive income due to a decrease in the unrealized fair value of these cap agreements.
as of december 31, 2015, we maintain several interest rate cap agreements that were entered into in march 2013 with notional amounts totaling $2.7 billion on our term loan b debt. these agreements have the economic effect of capping the libor variable component of our interest rate at a maximum of 2.50% on an equivalent amount of our term loan b. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recognized debt expense of $2.4 million from these caps. the cap agreements expire on september 30, 2016. as of december 31, 2015, the total fair value of these cap agreements was immaterial. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded a loss of $1.6 million in other comprehensive income due to a decrease in the unrealized fair value of these cap agreements.
other items as a result of an embedded libor floor on the term loan b debt agreement and the swap and cap agreements, our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the senior secured credit facilities was 3.46%, based on the current margins in effect of 1.75% for the term loan a and 2.75% for the term loan b, as of december 31, 2015.
as of december 31, 2015, the interest rate on our term loan b debt is effectively fixed subject to an embedded libor floor which is higher than actual libor as of such date and the term loan b is also subject to an interest rate cap if libor should rise above 2.50%. interest rates on our senior notes are fixed by their terms. the libor variable component of our interest rate on the majority of our term loan a is economically fixed as a result of interest rate swaps.
our overall weighted average effective interest rate during the year ended december 31, 2015 was 4.42% and as of december 31, 2015 was 4.39%.
as of december 31, 2015, we had undrawn revolving credit facilities totaling $1.0 billion of which approximately $92.2 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. the remaining amount is unencumbered. in addition, hcp has an outstanding letter of credit of approximately $1.3 million that is secured by a certificate of deposit.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the quarter ended december 31, 2015, we determined that circumstances indicated it had become more likely than not that the goodwill and an indefinite-lived intangible asset of certain hcp reporting units had become impaired.
these circumstances included underperformance of the business in recent quarters, as well as changes in other market conditions, including government reimbursement cuts and our expected ability to mitigate them. we are performing the required
81
valuation of certain hcp reporting units and have estimated the fair value of their net assets and implied goodwill with the assistance of a third-party valuation firm. based on our current assessments, we recorded an estimated $206 million in non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of certain hcp reporting units. the final amount of these impairment charges will depend upon the final outcome of this valuation work, which we expect will be completed in the first quarter of 2016.
our hcp nevada, hcp florida, hcp colorado and kidney care malaysia reporting units remain at risk of further goodwill impairment. as of december 31, 2015, these reporting units have goodwill amounts of $424,468, $530,075, $16,897, and $13,329, respectively. as of december 31, 2015, the estimated fair values of the hcp nevada, hcp florida, hcp colorado and kidney care malaysia reporting units exceeded (fell short of) from their total carrying amounts by approximately (3.4)%, 0.7%, 9.5% and 11.2%, respectively.
for our at-risk hcp reporting units, further reductions in reimbursement rates or other significant adverse changes in expected future cash flows or valuation assumptions could result in further goodwill impairment charges in the future. for example, a sustained, long-term reduction of 3% in operating income for hcp nevada or hcp florida could reduce their estimated fair values by up to 2.0% and 1.6%, respectively. separately, an increase in their respective discount rates of 100 basis points could reduce the estimated fair values of hcp nevada and hcp florida by up to 2.9% and 2.8%, respectively.
in addition, we recorded a $4 million impairment charge related to one of our international reporting units.
long-term incentive compensation long-term incentive program (ltip) compensation includes both stock-based awards (principally stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and performance stock units) as well as long-term performance-based cash awards. long-term incentive compensation expense, which was primarily general and administrative in nature, was attributed among the dialysis and related lab services business, the hcp business, corporate administrative support, and the ancillary services and strategic initiatives.
our stock-based compensation awards are measured at their estimated fair values on the date of grant if settled in shares or at their estimated fair values at the end of each reporting period if settled in cash. the value of stock-based awards so measured is recognized as compensation expense on a cumulative straight-line basis over the vesting terms of the awards, adjusted for expected forfeitures.
during 2015, we granted approximately 994 thousand stock-settled stock appreciation rights (ssars) with an aggregate grant-date fair value of $17.9 million and a weighted-average expected life of approximately 4.1 years and approximately 279 thousand stock units with an aggregate grant-date fair value of $22.4 million and a weighted-average expected life of approximately 3.1 years.
long-term incentive compensation costs of $130.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 increased by approximately $11.7 million as compared to 2014. the increase in long-term incentive compensation was primarily due to an increase in the value of ltip awards that contributed expense during this period and ltip award forfeitures realized at a lower rate than previously expected.
long-term incentive compensation costs in 2014 increased by approximately $34.1 million as compared to 2013, primarily due to an increase in the value of ltip awards that contributed expense during this period and ltip award forfeitures realized at a lower rate than previously expected.
as of december 31, 2015, there was $124.0 million in total estimated but unrecognized long-term incentive compensation costs for ltip awards outstanding, including $63.6 million relating to stock-based awards under our equity compensation plans. we expect to recognize the performance-based cash component of these ltip costs over a weighted average remaining period of 1.0 years and the stock-based component of these ltip costs over a weighted average remaining period of 1.3 years.
for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we received $45.7 million, $59.1 million and $46.9 million, respectively, in actual tax benefits upon the exercise of stock awards. as a result of issuing ssars, beginning in 2013 we no longer have stock options outstanding and did not receive cash proceeds from stock option exercises during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
stock repurchases in 2015, we repurchased a total of 7,779,958 shares of our common stock for $575 million, or an average price of $73.96 per share. we also repurchased a total of 3,689,738 shares of our common stock for $249 million, or an average price of $67.61 per share, during january 2016.
on april 14, 2015, our board of directors approved additional share repurchases in the amount of $726 million. these approved share repurchases are in addition to the $274 million remaining at that time under our board of directors' prior share repurchase
82
approval announced in november 2010. as a result of the above transactions, there was approximately $259 million available under our current board authorizations for additional share repurchases as of january 31, 2016. our share repurchase authorizations have no expiration dates. however, we are subject to share repurchase limitations under the terms of our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes.
off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations in addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases and letters of credit, as well as potential obligations associated with our equity investments in nonconsolidated businesses and to dialysis centers that are wholly-owned by third parties. substantially all of our u.s. dialysis facilities are leased. we have potential obligations to purchase the noncontrolling interests held by third parties in several of our majority-owned joint ventures, non-owned and minority-owned entities. these obligations are in the form of put provisions and are exercisable at the third-party owners' discretion within specified periods as outlined in each specific put provision. if these put provisions were exercised, we would be required to purchase the third-party owners' noncontrolling interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow attributable to the noncontrolling interests put to us, which is intended to approximate fair value. the methodology we use to estimate the fair values of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions assumes the higher of either a liquidation value of net assets or an average multiple of earnings, based on historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators that can affect future results, as well as other factors. the estimated fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions is a critical accounting estimate that involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which the noncontrolling interests may ultimately be settled, which could vary significantly from our current estimates. the estimated fair values of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions can fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these noncontrolling interests obligations may be settled will vary significantly depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers' access to the capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non-dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third-party owners' noncontrolling interests. the amount of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions that employ a contractually predetermined multiple of earnings rather than fair value are immaterial. for additional information see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
we also have certain other potential commitments to provide operating capital to several dialysis centers that are wholly-owned by third parties or centers in which we own a minority equity investment as well as to physician-owned vascular access clinics or medical practices that we operate under management and administrative services agreements. we have certain other potential commitments related to service agreements of approximately $5.6 million.
the following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31, 2015 (in millions):

the pay-fixed swap's obligations represent the estimated fair market values of our interest rate swap agreements that are based upon valuation models utilizing the income approach and commonly accepted valuation techniques that use inputs from closing prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets as well as other relevant observable market inputs and other current market conditions that existed as of december 31, 2015. currently all of our swaps are in an asset position. however, we could have a potential obligation that we would be required to pay based upon the estimated future settlement of each specific tranche over the term of the swap agreements, assuming no future changes in the forward yield curve if we were required to pay an amount in excess of what we would receive. the actual amount of our obligation associated with these swaps in the future will depend upon changes in the libor-based interest rates that can fluctuate significantly depending upon market conditions, and other relevant factors that can affect the fair market value of these swap agreements.
we are committed to purchase a certain amount of our hemodialysis non-equipment product supplies, such as dialyzers, from baxter at fixed prices through 2018.
in january 2010, we entered into and subsequently extended an agreement with fmc to purchase a certain amount of dialysis equipment, parts and supplies from fmc through february 29, 2016. we are currently renegotiating this agreement to extend the period of the agreement and to finalize the costs of our dialysis products. our total expenditures for the year ended december 31, 2015 on such products were approximately 2% of our total u.s. operating expenses. the actual amount of purchases in future years from fmc will depend upon a number of factors, including the operating requirements of our centers, the number of centers we acquire, and growth of our existing centers.
in november 2011, we entered into a seven year sourcing and supply agreement with amgen that expires on december 31, 2018. under the terms of the agreement we will purchase epo in amounts necessary to meet no less than 90% of our requirements for esas. the actual amount of epo that we will purchase from amgen will depend upon the amount of epo administered during dialysis as prescribed by physicians and the overall number of patients that we serve.
settlements of approximately $51 million of existing income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, penalties and other long-term tax liabilities, are excluded from the above table as reasonably reliable estimates of their timing cannot be made.
supplemental information concerning certain physician groups and unrestricted subsidiaries the following information is presented as supplemental data as required by the indentures governing our senior notes.
we provide services to certain physician groups that, while consolidated in our financial statements for financial reporting purposes, are not subsidiaries of or owned by us, do not constitute "subsidiaries", as defined in the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes, and do not guarantee those senior notes. in addition, we have entered into management agreements with these physician groups pursuant to which we receive management fees from the physician groups.
as of december 31, 2015, if these physician groups were not consolidated in our financial statements, our consolidated indebtedness would have been approximately $9.226 billion, our consolidated other liabilities (excluding indebtedness) would have been approximately $3.056 billion and our consolidated assets would have been approximately $17.956 billion. if these physician groups were not consolidated in our financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2015, our consolidated total net revenues (including approximately $650 million of management fees payable to us), consolidated operating income and consolidated net income would be reduced by approximately $1.132 billion, $82 million, and $52 million, respectively.
in addition, we own a 67% equity interest in cmgi, which is an unrestricted subsidiary as defined in the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes, and does not guarantee those senior notes. our equity interest in cmgi is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, meaning that, although cmgi is not consolidated in our financial statements for financial reporting purposes, our consolidated income statement reflects our pro rata share of cmgi's net income as equity investment income.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, excluding our equity investment income attributable to cmgi, our consolidated operating income and consolidated net income would be decreased by approximately $13 thousand and $8 thousand, respectively. see note 29 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
contingencies the information in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements of this report is incorporated by reference in response to this item.
84
critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles. these accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, contingencies and temporary equity. all significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. actual results will generally differ from these estimates. changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on-going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and accounts receivable, impairments of goodwill or other long-lived assets, accounting for income taxes, quarterly and annual variable compensation accruals, consolidation of variable interest entities, purchase accounting valuation estimates, fair value estimates, stock-based compensation and medical liability claims are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates.
dialysis and related lab services revenue recognition and accounts receivable. there are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of dialysis and related lab services revenue that we recognize in a given reporting period. payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. in addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will ultimately be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters.
revenues associated with medicare and medicaid programs are recognized based on (a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g., 80% for medicare patients) and (b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (e.g., medicaid secondary coverage), the patient's commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. effective january 1, 2011, our dialysis related reimbursements from medicare became subject to certain variations under medicare's new single bundled payment rate system whereby our reimbursements can be adjusted for certain patient characteristics and certain other factors. our revenue recognition depends upon our ability to effectively capture, document and bill for medicare's base payment rate and these other factors. in addition, as a result of the potential range of variations that can occur in our dialysis-related reimbursements from medicare under the new single bundled payment rate system, our revenue recognition is now subject to a greater degree of estimating risk.
commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed-care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates; however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients covered under commercial healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non-contracted commercial healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, a slowdown in collections, a reduction in the amounts that we expect to collect and regulatory compliance issues. determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our approximately 180,000 u.s. patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverage's that occur each month, requires complex, resource-intensive processes. collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years or longer after services are provided.
we generally expect our range of dialysis and related lab services revenues estimating risk to be within 1% of its revenue, which can represent as much as 5% of dialysis and related lab services' adjusted operating income. changes in estimates are reflected in the then-current financial statements based on on-going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses, and have not been significant.
lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received.
hcp revenue recognition. hcp revenues consist primarily of fees for medical services provided under capitated contracts with various health plans and under risk-sharing programs. revenues with respect to both professional and institutional capitation are recognized in the month in which enrollees are entitled to receive healthcare and are based on the number of enrollees selecting an hcp associated group physician employed or affiliated with one of hcp's medical group entities as their primary healthcare provider. capitation payments received for enrollees under medicare advantage plans are subject to retroactive adjustment depending upon certain clinical and demographic factors. we estimate the amount of current year adjustments in revenues during the first and second quarters of any given year and adjust our estimates during the third quarter upon receipt of payments from cms related to prior year. any difference between actual contract settlements and estimated revenues are recorded in the year of final settlement.
85
in addition, as compensation under hcp's various managed care-related agreements with hospitals, we are entitled to receive a percentage of the amount by which the institutional capitation revenue received from health plans exceeds institutional expenses, and any such risk-share amount to which we are entitled is recorded as hcp revenues. in addition, pursuant to such managed care-related agreements, hcp agrees to be responsible should the third party incur a deficit as a result of institutional expenses being in excess of institutional capitation revenue. as with global capitation, revenue with respect to professional capitation is reported in the month in which enrollees are entitled to receive healthcare. however, risk-share revenues (that is, the portion of the excess of institutional capitation revenue to which hcp is entitled less institutional expenses), in contrast, are based on the number of enrollees and significant estimating risk relating to institutional utilization and associated costs incurred by assigned health plan enrollees. the medical groups also receive other incentive payments from health plans based on specified performance and quality criteria and the amounts accrued when earned can be reasonably estimated. differences between actual contract settlements and estimated receivables and payables are recorded in the year of final settlement. in 2013, hcp obtained a restricted knox-keene license in california, which now permits hcp to enter into contracts with health plans allowing it to recognize revenue under global capitation arrangements for both professional and institutional services.
impairments of long-lived assets. we account for impairments of long-lived assets, which include property and equipment, equity investments in non-consolidated businesses, amortizable intangible assets, indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance. goodwill is not amortized, but is assessed for valuation impairment as circumstances warrant and at least annually. an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. impairment reviews on other long-lived assets are also performed at least annually and whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable.
such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, changes in reimbursement rates, deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers or other operations. we use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. the computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value.
accounting for income taxes. our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous state and foreign jurisdictions. significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense. deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations, assumptions about the amount of future state, federal, and foreign pre-tax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. the assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. the allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets.
variable compensation accruals. we estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate-specific and/or corporate financial and operating goals. our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses and other awards, including long-term incentive programs, are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award. actual results reflected in each fiscal quarter may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and/or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our board of directors, as applicable.
consolidation of variable interest entities. we rely on the operating activities of certain entities that we do not directly own or control, but over which we have indirect influence and of which we are considered the primary beneficiary. under accounting guidance applicable to variable interest entities, we have determined that these entities are to be included in our consolidated financial statements. the analyses upon which these determinations rest are complex, involve uncertainties, and require significant judgment on various matters, some of which could be subject to reasonable disagreement. while these determinations have a meaningful effect on the description and classification of various amounts in our consolidated financial statements, non-consolidation of these entities would not have had a material effect on our results of operations.

purchase accounting valuation estimates. we make various assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of tangible and intangible assets, liabilities, contingent earn-out consideration, noncontrolling interests and contractual as well as non-contractual contingencies associated with our acquisitions. these assumptions can have a material effect on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense and any contingent earn-out adjustments that will be recognized in the future.
fair value estimates. we have recorded certain assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests (temporary equity) subject to put provisions at fair value. the fasb defines fair value which is measured based upon certain valuation techniques that include inputs and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions. we have measured the fair values of our applicable assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions based upon certain market inputs and assumptions that are either observable or unobservable in determining fair values and have also classified these assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions into the appropriate fair value hierarchy levels. the fair value of our investments available for sale are based upon quoted market prices from active markets and the fair value of our swap and cap agreements were based upon valuation models utilizing the income approach and commonly accepted valuation techniques that use inputs from closing prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets as well as other relevant observable market inputs at quoted intervals such as current interest rates, forward yield curves, implied volatility and credit default swap pricing. the fair value of funds on deposit with third parties are based primarily on quoted close or bid market prices of the same or similar assets. the fair value of our contingent earn-out considerations were primarily based upon unobservable inputs including projected ebitda, the estimated probabilities of achieving other performance targets and the estimated probability of the earn-out payments being made by using option pricing techniques and simulation models of expected ebitda and operating income and other performance targets. for our noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions we have estimated the fair values of these based upon either the higher of a liquidation value of net assets or an average multiple of earnings based on historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators that can affect future results, as well as other factors. the estimate of the fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which the noncontrolling interests may ultimately be settled, which could vary significantly from our current estimates. the estimated fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions can also fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these noncontrolling interests obligations may be settled will vary depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers' access to the capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non-dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third-party owners' noncontrolling interests.
stock-based compensation. stock-based compensation awards are measured at their estimated fair values on the date of grant if settled in shares or at their estimated fair values at the end of each reporting period if settled in cash. the value of stock-based awards so measured is recognized as compensation expense on a cumulative straight-line basis over the vesting terms of the awards, adjusted for expected forfeitures. we estimate the fair value of stock awards using complex option pricing models that rely heavily on estimates from us about uncertain future events, including the expected term of the awards, the expected future volatility of our stock price, and expected future risk-free interest rates.
medical liability claims associated with hcp. the medical groups are responsible for the medical services that associated physicians and contracted hospitals provide to assigned hmo enrollees. we provide medical services to health plan enrollees through a network of contracted providers under sub-capitation and ffs arrangements, company-operated clinics and staff physicians. medical costs for professional and institutional services rendered by contracted providers are recorded as medical expenses and hospital expenses, respectively, in the consolidated statements of income. costs for operating medical clinics, including the salaries of medical and non-medical personnel and support costs, are recorded in clinic support and other operating costs.
an estimate of amounts due to contracted physicians, hospitals, and other professional providers is included in medical payables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. medical claims payable include claims reported as of the balance sheet date and estimates of ibnr. such estimates are developed using actuarial methods and are based on many variables, including the utilization of healthcare services, historical payment patterns, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, changes in membership, and other factors. the estimation methods and the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated. many of the medical contracts are complex in nature and may be subject to differing interpretations regarding amounts due for the provision of various services. we engage a third-party actuary to assist in the evaluation of the estimated ibnr reserves. such differing interpretations may not come to light until a substantial period of time has passed following the contract implementation. any adjustments to reserves are reflected in current operations.
significant new accounting standards new accounting standards we elected to early adopt accounting standards update (asu) no. 2015-03, interest - imputation of interest (subtopic 835-30): simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs, retrospectively effective as of january 1, 2014. the amendments in this asu require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from
87
the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. in august 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-15, interest - imputation of interest (subtopic 835-30) - presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements, which clarifies that the treatment of debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit may continue to be deferred in an asset position and subsequently amortized over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this asu. adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
we elected to early adopt asu no. 2015-17, income taxes (asc 740): balance sheet classification of deferred taxes, retrospectively effective as of january 1, 2014. the amendments in this asu serve to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. the update requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in february 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-02, leases (topic 842). the amendments in this asu revise the accounting related to lessee accounting. under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases. the new lease guidance also simplified the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. the amendments in this asu are effective for us beginning on january 1, 2019 and should be applied through a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. early adoption is permitted. we have not yet determined what the effects of adopting this asu will be on our consolidated financial statements.
in january 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-01, financial statements - overall (subtopic 825-10): recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. the amendments in this asu revise the accounting related to (i) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (ii) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities at fair value. the amendments in this asu are effective for us beginning on january 1, 2018 and should be applied through a cumulative-effect adjustment to the statement of financial position. early adoption is permitted under certain circumstances. the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in september 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-16, business combinations (topic 805): simplifying the accounting for measurement-period adjustments. the amendments in this asu allow an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. this will be inclusive of the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects as a result of the change to provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. the amendments in this asu became effective for us on january 1, 2016, and are applied prospectively. early adoption was permitted. the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in july 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-11, inventory (topic 330): simplifying the measurement of inventory. the amendments in this asu apply to all inventory with the exception of inventory measured using last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method. this asu simplifies the measurement of inventory. under this new standard, inventory should be measured using the lower of cost and net realizable value. net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. the amendments in this asu are effective for us beginning january 1, 2017 and should be applied prospectively. early adoption is permitted. the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in april 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-05, customer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement, which amends asc 350-40, intangibles-goodwill and other-internal-use software. this asu provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. if an arrangement includes a software license, the accounting for the license will be consistent with licenses of other intangible assets. if the arrangement does not include a license, the arrangement will be accounted for as a service contract. the amendments in this asu are effective for us beginning january 1, 2016 and can be adopted prospectively or retrospectively. we are currently assessing the effects of adopting this asu on our consolidated financial statements, however, the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in february 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-02, consolidation (topic 810): amendments to the consolidation analysis. the amendments in the asu clarify consolidation of vies regarding which reporting entity consolidates the legal entity. the amendments in the asu became effective for us on january 1, 2016. the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. the asu will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in u.s. gaap when it becomes effective. the new standard as issued
88
was to be effective for us on january 1, 2017. in july 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-14, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): deferral of effective date. this guidance approves a one-year deferral of the effective date of asu 2014-09. the final asu now requires us to adopt this standard on january 1, 2018. early application is permitted as of the initial effective date of january 1, 2017, but not prior to that date. the standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. we have assembled an internal revenue task force that meets regularly to discuss and evaluate the overall impact this guidance will have on the various revenue streams in the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, as well as the expected timing and method of adoption. we have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.

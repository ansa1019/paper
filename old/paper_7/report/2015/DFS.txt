item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis constitutes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k particularly under "risk factors" and "special note regarding forward-looking statements," which immediately follows "risk factors." unless otherwise specified, references to notes to our consolidated financial statements are to the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements as of december 31, 2015 and 2014 and for years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
introduction and overview discover financial services ("dfs") is a direct banking and payment services company. we provide direct banking products and services and payment services through our subsidiaries. we offer our customers credit card loans, private student loans, personal loans, home equity loans and deposit products. we also operate the discover network, the pulse network ("pulse") and diners club international ("diners club"). the discover network processes transactions for discover-branded credit cards and provides payment transaction processing and settlement services. pulse operates an electronic funds transfer network, providing financial institutions issuing debit cards on the pulse network with access to atms domestically and internationally, as well as point-of-sale ("pos") terminals at retail locations throughout the u.s. for debit card transactions. diners club is a global payments network of licensees, which are generally financial institutions, that issue diners club branded charge cards and/or provide card acceptance services. in june 2015, we announced that we are closing the mortgage origination business that we acquired in 2012, which was part of our direct banking segment. this disposition represents the exiting of an ancillary business that will not have a major impact on our operations.
our primary revenues consist of interest income earned on loan receivables and fees earned from customers, merchants and issuers. the primary expenses required to operate our business include funding costs (interest expense), loan loss provisions, customer rewards and expenses incurred to grow, manage and service our loan receivables and networks. our business activities are funded primarily through consumer deposits, securitization of loan receivables and the issuance of unsecured debt.
change in fiscal year in december 2012, our board of directors approved a change in our fiscal year end from november 30 to december 31 of each year. this fiscal year change was effective january 1, 2013. as a result of the change, we had a one month transition period in december 2012. the results for the one month ended december 31, 2012 is included in this section.

outlook the growth of our existing direct banking products remains a priority. we are pursuing new card accounts and wallet share gains with existing customers through investments in marketing and rewards as well as new features. we are also targeting growth in our private student and personal loans. as a result, we expect revenues to increase in 2016. other revenue is expected to decline in 2016 due to lower fee revenues driven by the exit of our mortgage origination business, continued decline in protection products revenue, and an increase in the credit card rewards rate. additionally, we continue to focus on capital deployment through organic growth in the business and through our quarterly dividends and share repurchase program.
the total charge-off rate is expected to increase slightly in 2016, assuming no material change in the macroeconomic environment. while the credit environment has been relatively stable, we added to the loan loss reserve in 2015 as we continue to grow receivables and recently originated loans season, which is currently expected to continue in 2016.
during 2015, higher expenses year over year were driven primarily by compliance costs, a portion of which were one-time. we continue to invest in areas supporting growth strategies and regulatory compliance, however, we expect total expenses in 2016 to be lower than 2015.
we continue to leverage our proprietary network to support our card-issuing business. in third party payments, we expect intense competition in the payments industry to persist. this environment will likely continue to impact the revenue margins, transaction volume and business strategies.
regulatory environment and developments in recent years, federal banking regulators have implemented and continue to propose new regulations and supervisory guidance under the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the "dodd-frank act") and otherwise, and have been increasing their examination and enforcement action activities. the dodd-frank act regulates large systemically significant financial firms, including discover, through a variety of measures, including increased capital and liquidity requirements, limits on leverage and enhanced supervisory authority. the dodd-frank act contains comprehensive provisions governing the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other
-50-
participants in the financial markets. we expect regulators to continue taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing concerns through non-public supervisory actions or findings.
the impact of the evolving regulatory environment on our business and operations depends upon a number of factors including supervisory priorities and actions, the actions of our competitors and other marketplace participants and the behavior of consumers. regulatory developments, findings and ratings could negatively impact our business strategies, require us to limit or change our business practices, limit our product offerings, invest more management time and resources in compliance efforts, limit the fees we can charge for services, or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities and obtain related required regulatory approvals. for additional information regarding bank regulatory limitations on acquisitions and investments, see "business - supervision and regulation - acquisitions and investments." for more information on recent matters affecting discover, see note 20: litigation and regulatory matters to our consolidated financial statements. regulatory developments also could impact our strategies, the value of our assets, or otherwise adversely affect our businesses.
compliance expenditures have increased significantly for discover and other financial services firms, and we expect them to continue to increase as regulators remain focused on controls and operational processes. we may face additional compliance and regulatory risk to the extent that we enter into new business arrangements with third-party service providers, alternative payment providers or other industry participants. the additional expense, time and resources needed to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may adversely impact our business and results of operations.
consumer financial services the consumer financial protection bureau ("the cfpb") regulates consumer financial products and services, as well as certain financial services providers, including discover. the cfpb is authorized to prevent "unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices" and ensure consistent enforcement of laws so that all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services that are fair, transparent and competitive. the cfpb has rulemaking and interpretive authority under the dodd-frank act and other federal consumer financial services laws, as well as broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over large providers of consumer financial products and services, such as discover. under its rulemaking authority, the cfpb announced that it is considering rules that will limit the use of arbitration clauses. for more information, see note 20: litigation and regulatory matters to our consolidated financial statements.
several of our products, including credit cards, private student loans and home loans, are areas of focus of the cfpb. the cfpb collects detailed account level information from us about credit cards and other products, and is authorized to collect fines and require consumer restitution in the event of violations. in addition, the cfpb has an online complaint portal that shows the subject matter of consumers' complaints about financial products, as well as the nature of financial services providers' responses to each complaint, such as whether requested relief was provided. in june 2015, the cfpb began publishing narratives of complaints made to the cfpb by consumers who opted to have their complaint narratives made public. the publication through the portal of unverified detailed consumer narratives could lead to reputational injury of financial institutions. the cfpb's analysis of account data and complaints could inform future decisions with respect to regulatory, enforcement or examination focus, and influence consumers' attitudes about doing business with discover.
credit cards pursuant to the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 (the "card act"), the cfpb recently concluded its bi-annual review of the consumer credit card market. the bi-annual review report provided additional guidance for credit card issuers and concluded that the card act reduced the overall cost of credit. the report discussed the use of new technology, including the movement of marketing and the opening of new accounts to digital channels. the cfpb also discussed debt collection practices and the complexity of card agreements and rewards programs. the cost and availability of credit, credit disclosures and consumer experience with debt collectors continue to be a focus of the cfpb. we anticipate that the cfpb will propose debt collection regulations that apply to our lending business in 2016. courts and legislators also have been focused on the debt collection practices of consumer financial services providers. the ultimate impact of this increased scrutiny is uncertain at this time.
private student loans there continues to be significant legislative and regulatory focus on the private student loan market, including by the cfpb and the federal deposit insurance corporation (the "fdic"). this regulatory focus has resulted in an increase
-51-
in supervisory examinations of discover related to private student loans. on july 22, 2015, the cfpb issued a consent order with respect to certain student loan servicing practices of discover bank, the student loan corporation and discover products, inc. see note 20: litigation and regulatory matters to our consolidated financial statements for more information.
the recent regulatory areas of focus include servicing and collection practices and other matters. on september 29, 2015, the cfpb issued a report, student loan servicing: analysis of public input and recommendations for reform, which analyzes public comments to the cfpb's may 2015 request for information on student loan servicing and synthesizes public recommendations regarding certain student loan servicing practices. on october 1, 2015, the department of education issued its report, strengthening the student loan system to better protect all borrowers, which makes recommendations for student loan policy initiatives. in connection with these reports, the cfpb, department of education and the department of treasury issued a "joint statement of principles on student loan servicing," setting forth regulatory principles to ensure that student loan servicing is consistent, accurate and actionable, accountable, and transparent. the enactment of new legislation or the adoption of new regulations or guidance may increase the complexity and expense of servicing student loans. legislators and regulators may take additional actions that impact the student loan market in the future, which could cause us to restructure our private student loan products in ways that we may not currently anticipate.
mortgage lending in june 2015, we announced the closure of our mortgage origination business acquired in 2012. we will continue to originate home equity loans through discover bank. the mortgage industry continues to be an area of supervisory focus and cfpb has stated that it will concentrate its examinations on the variety of mortgage-related topics including steering consumers to less favorable products, discrimination, abusive or unfair lending practices, predatory lending, origination disclosures, minimum mortgage underwriting standards, mortgage loan origination compensation and servicing practices. the cfpb has published several final rules impacting the mortgage industry, including rules related to ability-to-repay, mortgage servicing, the home mortgage disclosure act and integrated mortgage origination disclosures.
payment networks the dodd-frank act contains several provisions impacting the debit card market, including network participation requirements and interchange fee limitations. the changing debit card environment, including competitor actions related to merchant and acquirer pricing and transaction routing strategies, has adversely affected and is expected to continue to adversely affect our pulse network's business practices, network transaction volume, revenue and prospects for future growth. we continue to closely monitor competitor pricing strategies in order to assess their impact on our business and on competition in the marketplace. the u.s. department of justice is examining some of these competitor pricing strategies. in addition, pulse filed a lawsuit against visa in late 2014 with respect to these competitive concerns, which will significantly impact expenses for the payment services segment. in addition, the dodd-frank act's network participation requirements impact pulse's ability to enter into exclusivity arrangements, which affects pulse's current business practices and may materially adversely affect its network transaction volume and revenue.
increasing cybersecurity threats and incidents regarding unauthorized access to consumer information have resulted in a continued focus by congress and state legislators on legislation to address data security. in december 2015, the president signed an omnibus spending package that included the cybersecurity act of 2015. the cybersecurity act establishes a framework to facilitate and encourage confidential sharing of cybersecurity information among private sector and federal government entities and provides liability shields for cybersecurity information sharing under the act. though the act is effective immediately, the attorney general and the department of homeland security secretary must release guidelines within 90 days to implement these provisions of the act. additionally, legislation has been proposed to address security breach notification. these developments could ultimately result in the imposition of requirements on discover or other card issuers, or networks that could increase costs or adversely affect the competitiveness of our credit card or debit card products. it is too early to know if the proposed legislation will become law or the impact of these developments on discover.
european interchange fee regulation entered into force in june 2015. certain provisions became effective in december 2015, while others will come into effect in june 2016. the regulation, among other things, caps interchange fees of "four-party" networks such as visa and mastercard. however, the regulation provides that "three-party" networks should be treated as "four-party" networks when they license third-party providers to issue cards and/or acquire merchants or when they issue cards with a co-brand partner or through an agent. this means the caps apply to
-52-
elements of the financial arrangements agreed to between diners club and each of our stand-alone acquirers in western europe. the caps took effect in december 2015. the regulation excludes commercial card transactions from the scope of the caps. the regulation also contains a number of business rules, which we are assessing and, to the extent applicable, implementing. we are continuing to evaluate our business strategies.
there are additional initiatives in europe that may have an impact on our diners club business, including revisions to the payment services directive ("psd2") and the new general data protection regulation ("gdpr"). the psd2 was published in the official journal of the eu in december 2015. following the publication, each european union member state has two years to transpose the psd2 into its national law. among other terms, the psd2 includes provisions that once transposed into local law will regulate surcharging and network access requirements, which may result in differential surcharging of diners club cards and may impact diners club licensing arrangements in europe. the european parliament's civil liberties, justice and home affairs committee approved the final draft of the gdpr in december 2015. the gdpr, which updates data protection law across the european union, is expected to be ratified by the european council and the european parliament in early 2016 and organizations will then have two years to prepare before the legislation comes into force in early 2018. it is too early to know the impact of the gdpr on our business.
capital, liquidity and funding capital discover financial services and discover bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements that became effective january 1, 2015 under final rules issued by the federal reserve and the fdic to implement the provisions under the basel committee's december 2010 framework (referred to as "basel iii"). the final capital rules ("basel iii rules") require minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios and define what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios. in addition, the basel iii rules establish a capital conservation buffer above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements, which must consist entirely of common equity tier 1 ("cet1") capital and result in higher required minimum ratios by up to 2.5%. the new capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning on january 1, 2016 and will be fully implemented in january 2019. a banking organization will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below any of the minimum capital requirements, including the buffer amount. based on our current capital composition and levels and business plans, we believe that we are and will continue to be in compliance with the requirements for the foreseeable future. for additional information, see "- liquidity and capital resources - capital."
liquidity we are subject to the federal reserve's final rule implementing certain enhanced prudential standards under the dodd-frank act for large u.s. bank holding companies, including enhanced liquidity and risk management requirements, which became effective january 1, 2015. the final rule prescribes a broad range of qualitative liquidity risk management practices.
additionally, in september 2014, federal banking regulators published a final rule to implement the liquidity coverage ratio as a new quantitative requirement designed to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of large and internationally active banking organizations in the united states. the ratio requires covered banks to maintain an amount of high-quality liquid assets sufficient to cover projected net cash outflows during a prospective 30-day calendar period under an acute, hypothetical liquidity stress scenario. we are subject to this new requirement and will be required to maintain a liquidity ratio of 90% in 2016, which will increase to 100% in 2017. we believe our liquidity management practices position us well to comply with this new standard.
results of operations the discussion below provides a summary of our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2014 and year ended december 31, 2013. the discussion also provides information about our loan receivables as of december 31, 2015 compared to december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013.

segments we manage our business activities in two segments: direct banking and payment services. in compiling the segment results that follow, our direct banking segment bears all corporate overhead costs that are not specifically associated with a particular segment and all costs associated with discover network marketing, servicing and infrastructure, with the exception of an allocation of direct and incremental costs driven by our payment services segment.
direct banking our direct banking segment includes discover-branded credit cards issued to individuals on the discover network and other consumer products and services, including private student loans, personal loans, home equity loans, and other consumer lending and deposit products. we announced the closure of our mortgage origination business in june 2015 as described in note 3: business dispositions to our consolidated financial statements. the majority of direct banking revenues relate to interest income earned on the segment's loan products. additionally, our credit card products generate substantially all of our revenues related to discount and interchange, protection products and loan fee income.
payment services our payment services segment includes pulse, an automated teller machine, debit and electronic funds transfer network; diners club, a global payments network; and our network partners business, which provides payment transaction processing and settlement services on the discover network. the majority of payment services revenues relate to transaction processing revenue from pulse and royalty and licensee revenue (included in other income) from diners club. additionally until its sale on october 1, 2015, this segment included the business operations of diners club italy, which primarily consisted of activity related to issuing diners club charge cards in that country.

direct banking for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014
our direct banking segment reported pretax income of $3.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to pretax income of $3.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014.
loan receivables totaled $72.4 billion at december 31, 2015, which was up from $69.9 billion at december 31, 2014, due to growth in credit card loans and other loan portfolios, partially offset by a decrease in purchased credit-impaired ("pci") student loan balances. discover card sales volume was $118.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015, which was an increase of 2.5% as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. this volume growth was driven primarily by an increase in discretionary spending partially offset by the impact of lower gas prices.
interest income rose over the prior year due to growth in credit card, personal and private student loans, partially offset by lower yields on personal loans, as well as a decrease in pci student loan balances. interest expense increased during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily due to increases in unsecured debt to fund loan growth.
at december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, our delinquency rate for credit card loans over 30 days past due was 1.72% and 1.73%, respectively. for the year ended december 31, 2015, our net charge-off rate on credit card loans decreased as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, however higher levels of net charge-offs and higher loan balances led to an increase in the provision for loan loss dollars for the year ended december 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. for a more detailed discussion on provision for loan losses, see "- loan quality - provision and allowance for loan losses."
total other income increased for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily due to the combination of a one-time charge from the reversal of the customer rewards forfeiture accrual, after cashback reward terms were changed in 2014 and an increase in transaction volume, which increased discount and interchange revenue. the increase in total other income was partially offset by the loss of mortgage revenue due to the sale of that business and lower protection products revenue reflecting our no longer selling these products and eliminating related retention efforts.
-55-
total other expense increased for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was primarily driven by higher professional fees and higher employee compensation and benefit costs partially offset by the mortgage business goodwill impairment recorded in 2014 with no similar 2015 charge. the increase in professional fees was driven by anti-money laundering and related compliance program expenses. the growth in employee compensation costs resulted from growth in overall headcount driven in part by regulatory and compliance needs. also contributing to the increase in total other expense is an increase in other expense related to the closure of our mortgage origination business.
for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013
our direct banking segment reported pretax income of $3.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared to pretax income of $3.9 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013.
loan receivables totaled $69.9 billion at december 31, 2014, which was up from $65.8 billion at december 31, 2013, due to growth in credit card loans and other loan portfolios partially offset by a decrease in pci student loan balances. the growth in credit card loans was due to growth in customers with revolving balances partially offset by a higher net principal charge-off rate. the growth within the other loans portfolio was primarily attributable to organic growth in personal and private student loans. discover card sales volume was $115.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014, which was an increase of 5% as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. this volume growth was driven primarily by continued growth in new accounts combined with lower attrition.
net interest margin increased for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. this was primarily driven by higher yields on total loan receivables combined with lower interest rates on funding. the increase in loan receivable yields was driven by higher interest rates and growth in non-promotional revolving balances, partially offset by decline in higher rate balances along with growth in credit card promotional balances.
interest income increased during the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 primarily due to higher average balances of credit card loans, personal loans and private student loans resulting from growth across these products. the increase was also attributable to higher yields on credit card loans and pci student loans, partially offset by a decrease in yield on personal loans along with a decrease in pci student loan balances.
interest expense was relatively flat during the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, as lower interest expense on deposits attributable to lower yields was offset by higher interest expense resulting from increase in borrowings.
at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, our delinquency rate for credit card loans over 30 days past due was 1.73% and 1.72%, respectively. for the year ended december 31, 2014, our net charge-off rate on credit cards remained relatively flat as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. recent loan growth has led to an increase in reserves required to cover losses from loan seasoning. "seasoning" refers to the maturing of a loan portfolio as, in general, loans do not begin to show signs of credit deterioration or default until they have been in repayment for some period of time. an increase in reserve requirements combined with lower recoveries led to an increase in the provision for loan losses for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. for a more detailed discussion on provision for loan losses, see "- loan quality - provision and allowance for loan losses."
total other income decreased for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 primarily due to a one-time charge to customer rewards costs resulting from the elimination of our current estimate of customer rewards forfeiture of $178 million, which reduced discount and interchange revenue. gain on sale of mortgage loans also decreased, driven primarily by lower mortgage refinance volume due to increased mortgage interest rates in 2013, as well as changes in product mix. the overall decrease in other income was also attributable to a decrease in protection product revenue reflecting lower sales volume as we have stopped selling these products.
total other expense increased for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily due to higher employee compensation costs driven by growth in headcount, along with higher professional fees related to technology and digital investments. marketing and business development costs, and information processing and communications costs also increased due to growth initiatives. the goodwill impairment of $27 million related to the discover home loans business also contributed to overall increase in total

other expenses. for more information, see note 8: goodwill and intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements.
payment services for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014
our payment services segment reported pretax income of $100 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to pretax income of $89 million the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily due to a decrease in other expense partially offset by a decrease in other income. the other expense decline was primarily driven by expenses for diners club international associated with recording diners club italy as held for sale in 2014 and the associated fair value adjustment. the decrease in other income was primarily driven by a reduction in transaction processing revenue from pulse associated with the loss of two large third-party issuers.
transaction dollar volume decreased $12.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily driven by declines in pulse network volume. the number of transactions processed on the pulse network decreased for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014.
a weakening of the global economy or negative impacts in foreign currency may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations in our payment services segment. we continue to work with our diners club licensees with regard to their ability to maintain financing sufficient to support business operations. although support to licensees declined in 2015, we may continue to provide additional support in the future, including loans, facilitating transfer of ownership, or acquiring assets or licenses, which may cause us to incur losses. the licensees that we currently consider to be of concern accounted for approximately 5% of diners club revenue for the year ended december 31, 2015.
for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013
our payment services segment reported pretax income of $89 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, up $9 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily as the result of a decrease in loan losses related to certain diners club licensee loans and other expense, partially offset by a decrease in other income. the decrease in other expense was primarily due to non-recurring expenses incurred in 2013 related to our purchase of the diners club italy licensee and financial assistance to facilitate the purchase of the slovenian licensee by a european bank. the decrease in other expense was partially offset by a fair value adjustment of $21 million resulting from recording diners club italy as held for sale in 2014. the decrease in other income was primarily driven by a decrease in transaction processing revenue reflecting the impact of merchant rerouting and lower rates.
transaction dollar volume increased $5.8 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily driven by a growth in pulse network volume. the number of transactions processed on the pulse network increased slightly for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013.
we have been working with our european diners club licensees with regard to their ability to maintain financing sufficient to support business operations. we may provide additional support in the future, including loans, facilitating transfer of ownership, or acquiring assets or licenses, which may cause us to incur losses. the licensees that we currently consider to be of concern accounted for approximately 4% of diners club revenue for the year ended december 31, 2014. in addition, diners club has $151 million of non-amortizable intangible assets at december 31, 2014. while we determined that none of these intangibles are presently impaired, to the extent that we are unable to maintain diners club revenues at appropriate levels, we may be exposed to a non-cash impairment loss on these assets that, when recognized, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap"), management must make judgments and use estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are uncertain. for estimates that involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity, it is possible that different estimates could reasonably be derived for the same period. for estimates that are particularly sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions, significant changes to the estimated amount from period to period are also possible. management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate. however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and
-57-
other considerations used in estimating amounts in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and, in certain cases, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition. management has identified the estimates related to our allowance for loan losses, the evaluation of goodwill and other non-amortizable intangible assets for potential impairment, the accrual of income taxes, and estimates of future cash flows associated with pci loans as critical accounting estimates.
allowance for loan losses we base our allowance for loan losses on several analyses that help us estimate incurred losses as of the balance sheet date. this estimate considers uncollectible principal, interest and fees reflected in the loan receivables. while our estimation process includes historical data and analysis, there is a significant amount of judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results produced to determine the allowance. we use a migration analysis to estimate the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency. management also estimates loss emergence by using other analyses to estimate losses incurred from non-delinquent accounts. the considerations in these analyses include past and current loan performance, loan seasoning and growth, current risk management practices, account collection strategies, economic conditions, bankruptcy filings, policy changes and forecasting uncertainties. given the same information, others may reach different reasonable estimates.
if management used different assumptions in estimating incurred net loan losses, the impact to the allowance for loan losses could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. for example, a 10% change in management's estimate of incurred net loan losses could have resulted in a change of approximately $187 million in the allowance for loan losses at december 31, 2015, with a corresponding change in the provision for loan losses. see "- loan quality" and note 2: summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for further details about our allowance for loan losses.
goodwill we recognize goodwill when the purchase price of an acquired business exceeds the total of the fair values of the acquired net assets. as required by gaap, we test goodwill for impairment annually, or more often if indicators of impairment exist. in evaluating goodwill for impairment, management must estimate the fair value of the reporting unit(s) to which the goodwill relates. because market data concerning acquisitions of comparable businesses typically are not readily obtainable, other valuation techniques such as earnings multiples and cash flow models are used in estimating the fair values of these reporting units. in applying these techniques, management considers historical results, business forecasts, market and industry conditions and other factors. we may also consult independent valuation experts where needed in applying these valuation techniques. the valuation methodologies we use involve assumptions about business performance, revenue and expense growth, capital expenditures, discount rates and other assumptions that are judgmental in nature.
during the fourth quarter of 2013, we changed the date of our annual goodwill impairment test from june 1 to october 1. this goodwill impairment test date change was applied prospectively beginning on october 1, 2013 and had no effect on the consolidated financial statements.
at december 31, 2015, we had goodwill of $255 million. if economic conditions deteriorate or other events adversely impact the assumptions used by management in these valuations, we may be exposed to an impairment loss that, when recognized, could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. at december 31, 2015, based on the annual impairment testing performed, there were no impairment charges identified. see note 8: goodwill and intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements for further details about goodwill and the related impairment charge.
other non-amortizable intangible assets we recognized certain other non-amortizable intangible assets in our acquisition of the diners club business. as required by gaap, we test other non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually, or more often if indicators of impairment exist. because market data concerning acquisitions of intangible assets is not readily available, management evaluates non-amortizable intangible assets for potential impairment by estimating their fair values using discounted cash flow models. in applying these techniques, management considers historical results, business forecasts, market and industry conditions and other factors. we may also consult independent valuation experts where needed in applying these valuation techniques. the valuation methodologies we use involve assumptions about business performance, revenue and expense growth, discount rates and other assumptions that are judgmental in nature.
-58-
during the fourth quarter of 2013, we changed the date of our annual impairment test for non-amortizable intangible assets from june 1 to october 1. this non-amortizable intangible assets impairment test date change was applied prospectively beginning on october 1, 2013 and had no effect on the consolidated financial statements.
at december 31, 2015, we had non-amortizable intangibles of $155 million. if economic conditions deteriorate or other events adversely impact the assumptions used by management in these valuations, we may be exposed to an impairment loss that, when recognized, could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. at december 31, 2015, based on the annual impairment testing performed, there was no impairment recorded on any non-amortizable intangible asset.
income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the jurisdictions where we have business operations, primarily the united states, its states and municipalities. we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions. disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. we regularly evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years' examinations, and tax reserves are established as appropriate.
changes in the estimate of income taxes can occur due to tax rate changes, interpretations of tax laws, the status and resolution of examinations by the taxing authorities, and newly enacted laws and regulations that impact the relative merits of tax positions taken. when such changes occur, the effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations can be significant. see note 16: income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about income taxes.
purchased credit-impaired loans the estimate of expected future cash flows on pci loans determines the amount of interest income we can recognize in future periods and impacts whether a loan loss reserve must be established for these loans. we reevaluate, by pool, the amount and timing of expected cash flows quarterly using updated loan portfolio characteristics as well as assumptions regarding expected borrower default and prepayment behavior. because estimates of expected future cash flows on pci loans involve assumptions and significant judgment, it is reasonably possible that others could derive different estimates than ours for the same periods. in addition, changes in estimates from one period to the next can have a significant impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. a decrease in expected cash flows involving an increase in estimated credit losses would result in an immediate charge to earnings for the recognition of a loan loss provision. increases or decreases in expected cash flows related solely to changes in estimated prepayments or to changes in variable interest rate indices would result in prospective yield adjustments over the remaining life of the loans. an increase in expected cash flows due to a reduction in expected credit losses would result first in the reversal of any previously established loan loss reserve on pci loans through an immediate credit to earnings and then, if needed, a prospective adjustment to yield over the remaining life of the loans.
if management used a different estimate of expected borrower defaults, our consolidated statement of financial condition and results of operations could have differed. for example, a 10% increase in the expected borrower default rate of each pci loan pool as of december 31, 2015 could have resulted in an additional impairment of up to $8 million. this impairment would have been reflected as an increase in provision for loan losses and a decrease in the carrying value of the pci loans. the accounting and estimates used in our calculations are discussed further in note 5: loan receivables to our consolidated financial statements.

net interest income the tables that follow this section have been provided to supplement the discussion below and provide further analysis of net interest income, net interest margin and the impact of rate and volume changes on net interest income. net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred to finance those assets. we analyze net interest income in total by calculating net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average total loan receivables) and net yield on interest-bearing assets (net interest income as a percentage of average total interest-earning assets). we also separately consider the impact of the level of loan receivables and the related interest yield and the impact of the cost of funds related to each of our funding sources, along with the income generated by our liquidity portfolio, on net interest income.
our interest-earning assets consist of: (i) cash and cash equivalents, primarily related to amounts on deposit with the federal reserve bank of philadelphia, (ii) restricted cash, (iii) investment securities and (iv) loan receivables. our interest-bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits, both direct-to-consumer and brokered, and long-term borrowings, including amounts owed to securitization investors. net interest income is influenced by the following:
•   the level and composition of loan receivables, including the proportion of credit card loans to other loans, as well as the proportion of loan receivables bearing interest at promotional rates as compared to standard rates;
•   the credit performance of our loans, particularly with regard to charge-offs of finance charges, which reduce interest income;
•   the terms of long-term borrowings and certificates of deposit upon initial offering, including maturity and interest rate;
•   the level and composition of other interest-bearing assets and liabilities, including our liquidity portfolio;
•   changes in the interest rate environment, including the levels of interest rates and the relationships among interest rate indices, such as the prime rate, the federal funds rate and the london interbank offered rate;
•   the effectiveness of interest rate swaps in our interest rate risk management program; and
•   the difference between the carrying amount and future cash flows expected to be collected on pci loans.
for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014
net interest income increased for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily driven by higher loan volumes, net of related increases in borrowings. interest income rose over the prior year due to growth in credit card, personal and private student loans, partially offset by lower yields on personal
-60-
loans, as well as a decrease in pci student loan balances. interest expense increased during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily due to increases in unsecured debt to fund loan growth.
for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013
net interest margin increased for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 primarily driven by an increase in the yield on total loan receivables combined with lower interest rates on funding. the increase in loan receivable yields was driven by higher interest rates and growth in non-promotional revolving balances, partially offset by a decline in higher rate balances along with growth in credit card promotional balances.
interest income increased during the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 primarily due to higher average balances of credit card loans, personal loans and private student loans resulting from growth across these products. the increase was also attributable to higher yields on credit card loans and pci student loans, partially offset by a decrease in yield on personal loans along with a decrease in pci student loan balances.
interest expense was relatively flat during the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, as lower interest expense on deposits attributable to lower yields was offset by higher interest expense resulting from increase in borrowings.

provision and allowance for loan losses provision for loan losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimated probable losses in the loan portfolio at each period end date. while establishing the estimate for probable losses requires management judgment, the factors that influence the provision for loan losses include:
•   the impact of general economic conditions on the consumer, including unemployment levels, bankruptcy trends and interest rate movements;
•   changes in consumer spending and payment behaviors;
•   changes in our loan portfolio, including the overall mix of accounts, products and loan balances within the portfolio and maturation of the loan portfolio;
•   the level and direction of historical and anticipated loan delinquencies and charge-offs;
•   the credit quality of the loan portfolio, which reflects, among other factors, our credit granting practices and effectiveness of collection efforts; and
•   regulatory changes or new regulatory guidance.
the provision for loan losses is the amount of expense realized after considering the level of net charge-offs in the period and the required amount of allowance for loan losses at the balance sheet date. for the year ended december 31, 2015, the provision for loan losses increased by $69 million, or 5%, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. for the year ended december 31, 2014, the provision for loan losses increased by $357 million, or 33%, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase in both periods was primarily due to increasing levels of net charge-offs combined with the reserve build over the amount of the allowance for loan losses at december 31, 2014 and 2013.
in determining the allowance for loan losses, we estimate probable losses separately for segments of the loan portfolio that have similar risk characteristics. we use a migration analysis to estimate the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency. we use other analyses to estimate losses incurred from non-

delinquent accounts which adds to the identification of loss emergence. we use these analyses together as a basis for determining our allowance for loan losses.
the allowance for loan losses was $1.9 billion at december 31, 2015, which reflects a $123 million reserve build over the amount of the allowance for loan losses at december 31, 2014. the reserve build, which primarily relates to credit card loans, was mainly due to loan growth and seasoning of the portfolio. at december 31, 2015, the level of the allowance related to personal loans increased as compared to december 31, 2014 also due to loan growth and continued seasoning of the portfolio. at december 31, 2015, the level of allowance attributable to student loans increased as compared to december 31, 2014 primarily due to a pci student loan impairment recorded as a result of revisions to credit loss assumptions for the underlying loans. at december 31, 2015, the level of allowance related to other loans was unchanged as compared to december 31, 2014.
the allowance for loan losses was $1.7 billion at december 31, 2014, which reflected a $98 million reserve build over the amount of the allowance for loan losses at december 31, 2013. the reserve build, which primarily related to credit card loans, was due mainly to seasoning of the loan growth and lower recoveries. at december 31, 2014, the level of the allowance related to personal and student loans increased as compared to december 31, 2013 due to loan growth and continued seasoning of the portfolios. the level of allowance related to other loans was unchanged for the period.

net charge-offs our net charge-offs include the principal amount of losses charged off less principal recoveries and exclude charged-off and recovered interest and fees and fraud losses. charged-off and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest income and loan fee income, respectively, which is effectively a reclassification of the provision for loan losses, while fraud losses are recorded in other expense. credit card loan receivables are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes 180 days contractually past due. personal loans and private student loans, which are closed-end consumer loan receivables, are generally charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes 120 days contractually past due. generally, customer bankruptcies and probate accounts are charged off at the end of the month 60 days following the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death but not later than the 180-day or 120-day contractual time frame.
the following table presents amounts and rates of net charge-offs of key loan products (dollars in millions):

(1)   charge-offs for pci loans did not result in a charge to earnings during any of the years presented and are therefore excluded from the calculation. see note 5: loan receivables to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the accounting for charge-offs on pci loans.
the net charge-off rate on our credit card loans decreased by 5 basis points for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014 as a result of lower bankruptcy filings partially offset by lower recoveries. the net charge-off rate on our personal loans grew by 11 basis points for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014 driven by higher charge-offs as a result of continued loan growth and seasoning of the portfolio. the net charge-off rate on our private student loans excluding pci loans decreased by 22 basis points for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014 resulting from continued favorable economic conditions.
the net charge-off rate on our credit card loans increased 6 basis points for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 during a period of historical lows. the net charge-off rate on our personal loans declined by 9 basis points for the same period due to growth in the personal loan portfolio as, in general, loans do not begin to show signs of credit deterioration or default for some period of time after origination. the net charge-off rate on our private student loans excluding pci loans was relatively flat for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to year ended december 31, 2013.

(1)   excludes pci loans which are accounted for on a pooled basis. since a pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and aggregate expectation of cash flows, the past-due status of a pool, or that of the individual loans within a pool, is not meaningful. because we are recognizing interest income on a pool of loans, it is all considered to be performing.

(1)   because of the uncertainty regarding loan repayment patterns, the above amounts have been calculated using contractually required minimum payments. historically, actual loan repayments have been higher than such minimum payments and, therefore, the above amounts may not necessarily be indicative of our actual loan repayments.
(2)   on june 16, 2015, we announced the closing of our mortgage origination business. pursuant to that announcement, we sold all mortgage loans held for sale in our portfolio and ceased originating new mortgages. note 3: business dispositions to our consolidated financial statements for more information.
at december 31, 2015, approximately $36.0 billion of our loan portfolio due after one year had interest rates tied to an index and approximately $17.5 billion were fixed-rate loans.
modified and restructured loans we have loan modification programs that provide for temporary or permanent hardship relief for our credit card loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. the temporary hardship program primarily consists of a reduced minimum payment and an interest rate reduction, both lasting for a period no longer than 12 months. the permanent modification program involves changing the structure of the loan to a fixed payment loan with a maturity no longer than 60 months and reducing the interest rate on the loan. the permanent modification program does not normally provide for the forgiveness of unpaid principal, but may allow for the reversal of certain unpaid interest or fee assessments. we also make loan modifications for customers who request financial assistance through external sources, such as a consumer credit counseling agency program. these loans continue to be subject to the original minimum payment terms and do not normally include waiver of unpaid principal, interest or fees. for additional information regarding the accounting treatment for these loans as well as amounts recorded in the financial statements related to these loans, see note 5: loan receivables to our consolidated financial statements.
for student loan borrowers, in certain situations we offer hardship payment forbearance to borrowers who are experiencing temporary financial difficulties and are willing to resume making payments. when a borrower is 30 or more days delinquent and granted a second hardship forbearance period, we classify these loans as troubled debt restructurings. in addition, we offer temporary reduced payment programs, which normally consist of a reduction of the minimum payment for a period of no longer than 12 months at a time. when a student loan borrower is enrolled in a temporary reduced payment program for 12 months or fewer over the life of the loan, the modification is not considered a troubled debt restructuring. no loans have been in a temporary modification program for greater than 12 months.
for personal loan customers, in certain situations we offer various payment programs, including temporary and permanent programs. the temporary programs normally consist of a reduction of the minimum payment for a period of no longer than 12 months with the option of a final balloon payment required at the end of the loan term or an extension of the maturity date with the total term not exceeding nine years. further, in certain circumstances, the interest
-70-
rate on the loan is reduced. the permanent programs involve changing the terms of the loan in order to pay off the outstanding balance over a longer term and also in certain circumstances reducing the interest rate on the loan. similar to the temporary programs, the total term may not exceed nine years. we also allow loan modifications for customers who request financial assistance through external sources, similar to our credit card customers discussed above. payments are modified based on the new terms agreed upon with the credit counseling agency. personal loans included in temporary and permanent programs are accounted for as troubled debt restructurings.
borrower performance after using payment programs or forbearance is monitored and we believe the programs help to prevent defaults and are useful in assisting customers experiencing financial difficulties. we plan to continue to use payment programs and forbearance and, as a result, we expect to have additional loans classified as troubled debt restructurings in the future.

discount and interchange revenue discount and interchange revenue includes discount revenue and acquirer interchange net of interchange paid to network partners. we earn discount revenue from fees charged to merchants with whom we have entered into card acceptance agreements for processing credit card purchase transactions. we earn acquirer interchange revenue from merchant acquirers on all discover network card transactions and certain diners club transactions made by credit card customers at merchants with whom merchant acquirers have entered into card acceptance agreements for processing credit card purchase transactions. we incur an interchange cost to card-issuing entities that have entered into contractual arrangements to issue cards on the discover network and on certain transactions on the diners club network. this cost is contractually established and is based on the card-issuing organization's transaction volume and is reported as a reduction to discount and interchange revenue. we offer our customers various reward programs, including the cashback bonus reward program, pursuant to which we pay certain customers a percentage of their purchase amounts based on the type and volume of the customer's purchases. reward costs are recorded as a reduction to discount and interchange revenue. discount and interchange revenue increased for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily driven by lower prior year reward costs as a result of the rewards redemption policy change in 2014. also contributing to the increase was higher gross discount and interchange revenue resulting from higher sales volume. discount and interchange revenue decreased for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, driven primarily by the rewards redemption policy change. this increase in rewards was partially offset by the increase in gross discount and interchange revenue, which was primarily attributable to higher sales volume.

protection products we earn revenue related to fees received for providing ancillary products and services, including payment protection and identity theft protection services, to customers. the amount of revenue recorded is generally based on either a percentage of a customer's outstanding balance or a flat fee and is recognized as earned. protection product revenue decreased both for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, and for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, reflecting the impact of our no longer selling these products and eliminating related retention efforts.
transaction processing revenue transaction processing revenue represents switch fees charged to financial institutions and merchants for processing atm, debit and pos transactions over the pulse network, as well as various participation and membership fees. switch fees are charged on a per transaction basis. transaction processing revenue decreased for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014 due to lower point-of-sale transactions. transaction processing revenue decreased for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 reflecting the impact of merchant rerouting and lower rates.
gain on origination and sale of mortgage loans gain on sale of mortgage loans consists of the net gain on the origination and sale of loans as well as the net gain on the related interest rate lock commitments and the net gain or loss on forward delivery contracts. revenue related to mortgage banking operations declined for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily driven by the closure of our mortgage origination business. revenue related to mortgage banking operations declined for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 primarily driven by an increase in mortgage interest rates that resulted in lower mortgage refinance volume. decline in revenue related to mortgage banking operation was also due to reduced margins in the industry resulting from increased competitive pressure since the increase in mortgage rates.
other income other income includes royalty revenues earned by diners club, merchant fees, revenue from the transition services agreement related to the acquisition of slc, revenue from merchants related to reward programs, revenues from network partners and other miscellaneous revenue items. other income decreased for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily due to decreased revenue for diners club international resulting from the sale of diners club italy in october, 2015. other income decreased for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 primarily due to certain merchant network fees that were reclassified out of other income to discount and interchange revenue during 2014.

total other expense increased $275 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was primarily driven by higher employee compensation and benefit costs and higher professional fees. the growth in employee compensation costs resulted from growth in overall headcount driven

in part by regulatory and compliance needs and the increase in professional fees was driven by anti-money laundering and related compliance program expenses. also contributing to the increase in total other expense is an increase in other expense related to the closure of our mortgage origination business.
total other expense increased $146 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily driven by higher employee compensation costs due to growth in overall headcount along with higher professional fees due to consultant expenses related to technology and digital investments. higher marketing and business development expenses also contributed to the increase in other expense mainly due to growth initiatives. the increase in total other expense was partially offset by a decrease in the other expense line item, which primarily resulted from non-recurring expenses incurred in 2013 related to our purchase of the diners club italy licensee and financial assistance to facilitate the purchase of the slovenian licensee by a european bank. the decrease in other expense line item was partially offset by the impairment of goodwill related to the discover home loans business along with fair value adjustment resulting from recording diners club italy as held for sale.

income tax expense decreased $103 million, or 7.0%, for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, reflecting a decrease in pretax income. the effective tax rate decreased 0.3% for the year ended december 31, 2014 from 37.4% for the year ended december 31, 2013 due to favorable adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits and recognition of tax benefits attributable to prior year tax adjustments.
liquidity and capital resources funding and liquidity we seek to maintain stable diversified funding sources and a strong liquidity profile in order to fund our business and repay or refinance our maturing obligations under both normal operating conditions and period of economic or financial stress. in addition, we seek to maintain an appropriate liability maturity profile and utilize a diversified and cost-effective mix of funding sources. our primary funding sources include deposits, sourced directly from consumers or through brokers, public and private term asset-backed securitizations and short-term and long-term borrowings.
funding sources deposits we offer deposit products to customers through two channels: (i) through direct marketing, internet origination and affinity relationships ("direct-to-consumer deposits"); and (ii) indirectly through contractual arrangements with securities brokerage firms ("brokered deposits"). direct-to-consumer deposits include certificates of deposit, money market accounts, online savings and checking accounts and ira certificates of deposit, while brokered deposits include certificates of deposit and sweep accounts. at december 31, 2015, we had $30.9 billion of direct-to-consumer deposits and $16.7 billion of brokered and other deposits.

credit card securitization financing we use the securitization of credit card receivables as a source of funding. we access the asset-backed securitization market using the discover card master trust i ("dcmt") and the discover card execution note trust ("dcent"), through which we issue dcent discoverseries notes both publicly and through private transactions. we retain significant exposure to the performance of trust assets through holdings of the seller's interest and subordinated security classes of dcent.
the securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors. the primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements, the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities. we refer to this as "economic early amortization," which is based on excess spread levels. excess spread is the amount by which income received by a trust during a collection period, including interest collections, fees and interchange, exceeds the fees and expenses of the trust during such collection period, including interest expense, servicing fees and charged-off receivables. in the event of an economic early amortization, which would occur if the excess spread fell below 0% on a three-month rolling average basis, we would be required to repay the affected outstanding securitized borrowings using available collections received by the trust (the period of ultimate repayment would be determined by the amount and timing of collections received). an early amortization event would negatively impact our liquidity, and require us to utilize our available non-securitization related contingent liquidity or rely on alternative funding sources, which may or may not be available at the time. as of december 31, 2015, the discoverseries three-month rolling average excess spread was 14.03%.
at december 31, 2015, we had $15.6 billion of outstanding public asset-backed securities and $6.0 billion of outstanding subordinated asset-backed securities that had been issued to our wholly-owned subsidiaries.
the following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors' interests in credit card securitizations excluding those that have been issued to our wholly-owned subsidiaries (dollars in millions):

the triple-a rating of dcent class a notes issued to date has been based, in part, on an fdic rule which created a safe harbor that provides that the fdic, as conservator or receiver, will not, using its power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts, seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization, or recharacterize them as assets of the insured depository institution, provided such transfer satisfies the conditions for sale accounting treatment under previous gaap. although the implementation of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic 860, transfers and servicing, no longer qualified certain transfers of assets for sale accounting treatment, the fdic approved a final rule that preserved the safe-harbor treatment applicable to revolving trusts and master trusts, including dcmt, so long as those trusts would have satisfied the original fdic safe harbor if evaluated under gaap pertaining to transfers of financial assets in effect prior to december 1, 2009. other legislative and regulatory developments may, however, impact our ability and/or desire to issue asset-backed securities in the future.
other long-term borrowings-student loans at december 31, 2015, we had $1.2 billion of remaining principal balance outstanding on securitized debt assumed as part of the acquisition of student loan corporation. principal and interest payments on the underlying student loans will reduce the balance of these secured borrowings over time.

certain discover financial services senior notes require us to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of a change of control involving us and a corresponding ratings downgrade to below investment grade.
short-term borrowings we formerly utilized a warehouse line of credit as a form of short-term funding for newly originated consumer residential mortgage loans in our discover home loans business. however, on june 16, 2015, discover financial services announced that it would close this business. consistent with that announcement, we ceased originating new mortgages and paid off the warehouse line of credit with the proceeds from the mortgage loan sales during the third quarter.
as part of our regular funding strategy, we may from time to time borrow short-term funds in the federal funds market or the repurchase ("repo") market through repurchase agreements. federal funds are short-term, unsecured loans between banks or other financial entities with a federal reserve account. funds borrowed in the repo market are short-term, collateralized loans usually secured with highly-rated investment securities such as u.s. treasury bills or notes, or federal agency mortgage bonds or debentures. at december 31, 2015, there were no outstanding balances under the federal funds market or repurchase agreements.
additional funding sources private asset-backed securitizations we have access to committed undrawn capacity through privately placed asset-backed securitizations. at december 31, 2015, we had total committed capacity of $6.8 billion, none of which was drawn. while we may utilize funding from these private securitizations from time to time for normal business operations, their committed nature also makes them a reliable contingency funding source. therefore, we reserve some undrawn capacity for potential contingency funding needs, based upon our liquidity stress testing results. on october 15, 2015, we terminated $1.0 billion of these secured credit facilities after determining through our liquidity stress testing process that we maintained appropriate levels of such facilities following the termination. we also seek to ensure the stability and reliability of these securitizations by staggering their maturity dates and renewing them approximately one year prior to their scheduled maturity dates.
federal reserve discover bank has access to the federal reserve bank of philadelphia's discount window. as of december 31, 2015, discover bank had $23.9 billion of available capacity through the discount window based on the amount and type of assets pledged. we have no borrowings outstanding under the discount window and reserve this capacity as a source of contingency funding.
funding uses our primary uses of funds include the extensions of loans and credit, primarily through discover bank, the purchase of investment securities for our liquidity portfolio, working capital and debt and capital service. we assess funding uses and liquidity needs under both the normal course of business and hypothetical adverse environments, considering primary uses of funding, such as on-balance sheet loans, and contingency uses of funding, such as the need
-75-
to post additional collateral for derivatives positions. in order to anticipate funding needs under adverse environments, we maintain liquidity stress scenarios that assess the impact of a range of unusual business events, such as severe economic recessions, financial market disruptions, adverse operational events and other forms of stress.
credit ratings our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets, including securitizations and unsecured senior and subordinated debt, may be affected by the credit ratings of dfs, discover bank and the securitization trusts. downgrades in these credit ratings could result in higher interest expense on our unsecured debt and asset securitizations, as well as potentially higher fees related to borrowings under our lines of credit. in addition to increased funding costs, deterioration in credit ratings could reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets.
we also maintain agreements with certain of our derivative counterparties that contain provisions that require dfs and discover bank to maintain an investment grade credit rating from specified major credit rating agencies. because the credit rating of dfs did not meet the specified thresholds, we had posted $4 million of collateral with our counterparties at december 31, 2015. discover bank's credit rating met specified thresholds set by its counterparties. however, if discover bank's credit ratings were reduced by one ratings notch, discover bank would be required to post additional collateral, which, as of december 31, 2015, would have been $73 million.
on november 20, 2015, standard & poor's affirmed its 'bbb-' and 'bbb' long-term issuer credit ratings on dfs and discover bank, respectively, and revised its outlook on the ratings from 'positive' to 'stable.'
a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. the credit ratings are summarized in the following table:

liquidity we seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations, fund asset growth and satisfy debt obligations under both normal and stress conditions. in addition to the funding sources discussed in the previous section we also maintain high-quality, liquid, unencumbered assets in our liquidity portfolio that we expect to be able to convert to cash quickly and with little loss of value using either the repo market or outright sales.
we maintain a liquidity risk and funding management policy which outlines the overall framework and general principles for managing liquidity risk across our businesses. the policy is approved by the board of directors with the implementation responsibilities delegated to the asset and liability management committee (the "alco"). we seek to balance the trade-offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which may be costly, with having too little liquidity, which could cause financial distress. liquidity risk is centrally managed by the alco, which is chaired by our treasurer and has cross-functional membership. the alco monitors the liquidity risk profiles of dfs and discover bank and

oversees any actions corporate treasury may take to ensure that we maintain ready access to our funding sources and sufficient liquidity to meet current and projected financial obligations.
we employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity. we developed early warning indicators ("ewis") to detect initial phases of liquidity stress events and a reporting and escalation process that is designed to be consistent with regulatory guidance. the ewis include both idiosyncratic and systemic measures, and are monitored on a daily basis and reported to the alco regularly. a warning from one or more of these indicators triggers prompt review and decision-making by our senior management team, and in certain instances may lead to the convening of a senior-level response team and activation of our contingency funding plan.
in addition, liquidity stress testing is conducted regularly and contingency funding planning is in place to seek to address potential liquidity shortfalls. we evaluate a range of stress scenarios that are designed in accordance with regulatory requirements, including idiosyncratic, systemic and a combination of the two events, that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs. these scenarios measure the projected liquidity position at dfs and discover bank across a range of time horizons by comparing estimated contingency funding needs to available contingent liquidity.
we maintain contingent funding sources, including our liquidity portfolio and private securitizations with unused capacity, which we could seek to utilize to satisfy liquidity needs during normal and stress conditions. we seek to maintain sufficient liquidity to be able to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business operations for at least 12 months in a severe stress environment. in addition, we have unused capacity with the federal reserve discount window which provides another source of contingent liquidity.
at december 31, 2015, our liquidity portfolio comprised of cash and cash equivalents and high-quality, liquid and unencumbered investment securities. cash and cash equivalents were primarily in the form of deposits with the federal reserve. investment securities primarily included debt obligations of the u.s. treasury and u.s. government agencies and residential mortgage-backed securities issued by u.s. government agencies. these investments are considered highly liquid, and we expect to have the ability to raise cash by selling them, utilizing repurchase agreements or, pledging certain of these investments to access the secured funding markets. the size and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the amount of expected liability maturities as well as operational requirements and market conditions.
at december 31, 2015, our liquidity portfolio and undrawn credit facilities were $42.8 billion, which was $8.5 billion higher than the balance at december 31, 2014. during the year ended december 31, 2015, the average balance of our liquidity portfolio was $13.1 billion.

bank holding company liquidity the primary uses of funds at the unconsolidated dfs level include debt and capital service (interest and dividend payments and return of principal), and capital management activity, which may include the periodic repurchase of shares of our common stock. our primary sources of funds at the bank holding company level include the proceeds from the issuance of unsecured debt and preferred stock in the capital markets, as well as dividends from our subsidiaries, particularly discover bank. under periods of idiosyncratic or systemic stress, the bank holding company could lose or experience impaired access to the capital markets. in addition, our regulators have the discretion to restrict dividend payments from discover bank to the bank holding company.
we utilize a measure referred to as number of months of pre-funding to determine the length of time discover financial services can meet upcoming funding obligations including common and preferred dividend payments and debt service obligations using existing cash resources. at december 31, 2015, discover financial services had sufficient cash resources to fund the dividend and debt service payments for more than 18 months.
we structure our debt maturity schedule to minimize the amount of debt maturing at the bank holding company level within a short period of time. as of december 31, 2015, there is no upcoming debt maturity in 2016 at the bank holding company level. our alco and board of directors regularly review our compliance with our liquidity limits as a bank holding company, which are established in accordance with the liquidity risk appetite articulated by our board.
capital our primary sources of capital are from the earnings generated by our businesses and common and preferred stock issuances in the capital markets. we seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the risks of our businesses, meet regulatory requirements, meet rating agency targets and debt investor expectations and support future business growth. within these constraints, we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that provides attractive returns to our stockholders. the level, composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment, strategic initiatives, and legislative and regulatory developments.
under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the federal reserve and the fdic, discover financial services, along with discover bank, must maintain minimum levels of capital. failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could limit our business activities and have a direct material effect on our financial position and results. we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, as calculated under regulatory guidelines. capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. current or future legislative or regulatory initiatives may require us to hold more capital in the future.
in 2013, the federal reserve, the office of the comptroller of the currency and the fdic issued the basel iii rules applicable to discover financial services and discover bank. under those rules, discover financial services and discover bank are classified as "standardized approach" entities, defined as u.s. banking organizations with consolidated total assets over $50 billion but not exceeding $250 billion and consolidated total on-balance sheet foreign exposures less than $10 billion. additional phase-in requirements related to components of the final capital rules will become effective through 2019. the basel iii rules include new minimum and "well-capitalized" risk-based capital and leverage ratios, effective january 1, 2015, and refine the definition of what constitutes "capital" for purposes of calculating those ratios of which certain requirements are subject to phase-in periods through the end of 2018 (the "transition period"). during the transition period, the effects of the changes to capital (i.e. certain deductions and adjustments) are recognized in 20% increments from 2015 through 2018. for example, one of the deductions from cet1 capital, goodwill and intangibles, is subject to a 40% of total deduction in 2015 that will increase to 60% in 2016 and so on, until reaching 100% deduction of total in 2018. for additional information regarding the risk-based capital and leverage ratios, see note 18: capital adequacy to our consolidated financial statements.
the basel iii rules also introduce a new capital conservation buffer on top of the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. the measure is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. the calculation of the buffer will be phased in beginning on january 1, 2016 at the rate of 0.625% and will increase by 0.625% on each subsequent january 1 until it reaches the maximum 2.5% on january 1, 2019. when the capital conservation buffer is fully phased-in on january 1, 2019, this will effectively result in minimum ratios of (i) cet1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0%, (ii) tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5% and (iii) total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%. banking institutions with a ratio of cet1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.

another main component of the basel iii rules is a prescribed standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets that expands the risk-weight range from 0% to 100% (under basel i) to 0% to 1,250% (under basel iii). the new range is intended to be more risk-sensitive and the risk-weight assigned depends on the nature of the asset in question.
the basel iii rules provide for a number of the deductions from and adjustments to cet1, to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of cet1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15%.
basel iii also requires additional disclosures relating to market discipline. this series of disclosures is commonly referred to as "pillar 3". the objective is to increase transparency of capital requirements for banking organizations. we are required to make prescribed regulatory disclosures on a quarterly basis regarding our capital structure, capital adequacy, risk exposures and risk-weighted assets. the effective date of the disclosure requirements began with our financial results for the first quarter of 2015. the pillar 3 disclosures are made publicly available, on our website, as a stand-alone report called "basel iii regulatory capital disclosures".
at december 31, 2015, discover financial services and discover bank met the requirements for "well-capitalized" status, exceeding the regulatory minimums to which they were subject under the basel iii rules.
as discussed in note 18: capital adequacy to our consolidated financial statements, we are subject to a cet1 capital ratio requirement under the basel iii rules as of january 1, 2015. we believe that providing an estimate of capital position based on the basel iii fully phased-in rules is important to complement the existing capital ratios and for comparability to other financial institutions. in addition, we disclose tangible common equity, which represents common equity less goodwill and intangibles. management believes that common stockholders' equity excluding goodwill and intangibles is a more meaningful measure to investors of our true net asset value. as of december 31, 2015, the cet1 capital ratio calculated under basel iii fully phased-in rules and tangible common equity are not formally defined by u.s. gaap or codified in the federal banking regulations, as such, they are considered to be non-gaap financial measures. other financial services companies may also disclose this ratio and metric and definitions may vary, so we advise users of this information to exercise caution in comparing this ratio and metric for different companies.
the following table provides a reconciliation of total common stockholders' equity (a u.s. gaap financial measure) to our cet1 capital calculated under basel iii fully phased-in rules as of december 31, 2014 and to tangible common equity as of december 31, 2015 (dollars in millions):

additionally, we are required to submit an annual capital plan to the federal reserve that includes an assessment of our expected uses and sources of capital over the nine quarter planning horizon. in january 2015, we submitted our annual capital plan to the federal reserve under the federal reserve's comprehensive capital analysis and review, or ccar, program, which included planned dividends and share repurchases over the nine quarter planning horizon. in march 2015, we received non-objection from the federal reserve with respect to our proposed capital actions through june 30, 2016. our ability to make capital distributions, including our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock, will continue to be subject to the federal reserve's review and non-objection of the actions that we propose each year in our annual capital plan.
also in march 2015, the federal reserve published the results of its annual supervisory stress tests for bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, including discover financial services. at that same time, we published company-run stress test results for discover financial services and discover bank. discover financial services is required to publish company-run stress tests results twice each year in accordance with federal reserve rules and discover bank is required to publish bank-run stress test results under fdic rules. we published our mid-year stress test results in july 2015.
we recently declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of $0.28 per share, payable on february 18, 2016 to holders of record on february 4, 2016, which is consistent with the dividend amount that we paid in each of the second, third and fourth quarters of 2015. we also recently declared a quarterly cash dividend on our preferred stock of $16.25 per share, equal to $0.40625 per depositary share, payable on february 29, 2016 to holders of record on february 10, 2016, which was the same as the amount paid on our preferred stock in each of the prior four quarters.
on april 16, 2015, our board of directors approved a five-quarter share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $2.2 billion of our outstanding shares of common stock. the program expires on july 31, 2016 and may be terminated at any time. this program replaced the prior $3.2 billion program, which had $1.7 billion of remaining authorization. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we repurchased approximately 29 million shares, or 6%, of our outstanding common stock for $1.7 billion. we expect to continue to make share repurchases under our repurchase program from time to time based on market conditions and other factors, subject to legal and regulatory requirements and restrictions. share repurchases under the program may be made through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or other purchases, including block trades, accelerated share repurchase transactions, or any combination of such methods.
the amount and size of any future dividends and share repurchases will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors. the declaration and payment of future dividends, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our board of directors. holders of our shares of common stock are subject to the prior dividend rights of holders of our preferred stock or the depositary shares representing such preferred stock outstanding, and if full dividends have not been declared and paid on all outstanding shares of preferred stock in any dividend period, no dividend may be declared or paid or set aside for payment on our common stock. in addition, as noted above, banking laws and regulations and our banking regulators may limit our ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases, including limitations on the extent to which our banking subsidiaries can provide funds to us through dividends, loans or otherwise. further, also noted above, current or future regulatory initiatives may require us to hold more capital in the future. there can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends or repurchase any shares of our common stock in the future. there can be no assurance

that we will declare and pay any dividends or repurchase any shares of our common stock in the future. for more information, including conditions and limits on our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our stock, see "business - supervision and regulation - capital, dividends and share repurchases," "risk factors - credit, market and liquidity risk - we may be limited in our ability to pay dividends on and repurchase our stock" and "- we are a holding company and depend on payments from our subsidiaries" and note 18: capital adequacy to our consolidated financial statements.
certain off-balance sheet arrangements guarantees guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make payments to a guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying asset, liability, or equity security of a guaranteed party, rate or index. also included in guarantees are contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to a guaranteed party based on another entity's failure to perform under an agreement. our guarantees relate to transactions processed on the discover network and certain transactions processed by pulse and diners club. see note 19: commitments, contingencies and guarantees to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our guarantees.
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. contractual obligations include deposits, long-term borrowings, operating and capital lease obligations, interest payments on fixed-rate debt, purchase obligations and other liabilities. our future cash payments associated with our contractual obligations are summarized below (dollars in millions):

(1)   deposits do not include interest payments because payment amounts and timing cannot be reasonably estimated as certain deposit accounts have early withdrawal rights and the option to roll interest payments into the balance.
(2)   deposits due in less than one year include deposits with indeterminate maturities.
(3)   see note 10: long-term borrowings to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. total future payment of interest charges for the floating-rate notes is estimated to be $559 million as of december 31, 2015, utilizing the current interest rates as of that date.
(4)   purchase obligations for goods and services include payments under, among other things, consulting, outsourcing, data, advertising, sponsorship, software license, telecommunications agreements and global acceptance contracts. purchase obligations also include payments under rewards program agreements with merchants. purchase obligations at december 31, 2015 reflect the minimum purchase obligation under legally binding contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. these amounts exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on our consolidated statement of financial condition.
(5)   other liabilities include our expected future contributions to our pension plan, the contingent liability associated with our equity method securities and a commitment to purchase certain when-issued mortgage-backed securities under an agreement with the delaware state housing authority as part of our community reinvestment initiatives.
as of december 31, 2015 our consolidated statement of financial condition reflects a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $286 million and approximately $131 million of accrued interest and penalties. since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated income tax obligations about which there is uncertainty have been excluded from the contractual obligations table. see note 16: income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for further information concerning our tax obligations.
we extend credit for consumer loans, primarily arising from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards, provided there is no violation of conditions established in the related agreement. at

december 31, 2015, our unused commitments were approximately $178.7 billion. these commitments, substantially all of which we can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, are periodically reviewed based on account usage, customer creditworthiness and loan qualification. in addition, in the ordinary course of business, we guarantee payment on behalf of subsidiaries relating to contractual obligations with external parties. the activities of the subsidiaries covered by any such guarantees are included in our consolidated financial statements.

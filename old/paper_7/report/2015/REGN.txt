item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.
overview we are a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company that discovers, invents, develops, manufactures, and commercializes medicines for the treatment of serious medical conditions. we commercialize medicines for eye diseases, high ldl cholesterol, and a rare inflammatory condition and have product candidates in development in other areas of high unmet medical need, including oncology, ra, asthma, atopic dermatitis, pain, and infectious diseases.
as described in part i, item 1. "business - general," and "business - marketed products," we currently have three marketed products: eylea (aflibercept) injection, praluent (alirocumab) injection, and arcalyst (rilonacept) injection for subcutaneous use. we also have 13 product candidates in clinical development, all of which were discovered in our research laboratories. these consist of a trap-based clinical program and 12 fully human monoclonal antibody product candidates, as summarized in part i, item 1. "business - general."
the planning, execution, and results of our clinical programs are significant factors that can affect our operating and financial results. in our clinical programs, key events in 2015 and 2016 to date were, and plans for the remainder of 2016 are, as follows:

developing and commercializing new medicines entails significant risk and expense. before significant revenues from the commercialization of our antibody candidates or new indications for our marketed products can be realized, we (or our collaborators) must overcome a number of hurdles which include successfully completing research and development and obtaining regulatory approval from the fda and regulatory authorities in other countries. in addition, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive, and new developments may render our products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete.
our ability to continue to generate profits and to generate positive cash flow from operations over the next several years depends significantly on our continued success in commercializing eylea. we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses related to our research and development activities, a significant portion of which we expect to be reimbursed by our collaborators. also, our research and development activities outside our collaborations, the costs of which are not reimbursed, are expected to expand and require additional resources. we also expect to incur substantial costs related to the commercialization of praluent and preparation for potential commercialization of our late-stage antibody product candidates, approximately half of which we expect to be reimbursed by sanofi under the companies' collaboration agreement. our financial results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on, among other factors, the net sales of our marketed products, the scope and progress of our research and development efforts, the timing of certain expenses, the continuation of our collaborations, in particular with sanofi and bayer healthcare, including our share of collaboration profits or losses from sales of commercialized products and the amount of reimbursement of our research and development expenses that we receive from collaborators, and the amount of income tax expense we incur, which is partly dependent on the profits or losses we earn in each of the countries in which we operate. we cannot predict whether or when new products or new indications for marketed products will receive regulatory approval or, if any such approval is received, whether we will be able to successfully commercialize such product(s) and whether or when they may become profitable.
critical accounting policies and use of estimates a summary of the significant accounting policies that impact us is provided in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (gaap) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the financial statements. management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:
•   it requires an assumption (or assumptions) regarding a future outcome; and
•   changes in the estimate or the use of different assumptions to prepare the estimate could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate. however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, and in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. the critical accounting estimates that impact our consolidated financial statements are described below.
revenue recognition product revenue product sales consist of u.s. sales of eylea and arcalyst. revenue from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title to product and associated risk of loss have passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, collection from the customer is reasonably assured, we have no further performance obligations, and returns can be reasonably estimated. we record revenue from product sales upon delivery to our distributors and specialty pharmacies (collectively, our customers).
revenue from product sales is recorded net of applicable provisions for rebates and chargebacks under governmental programs, such as medicaid and veterans' administration (va), distribution-related fees, prompt pay discounts, and other sales-related deductions. we estimate reductions to product sales based upon contracts with customers and government agencies, statutorily-defined discounts applicable to government-funded programs, historical experience, estimated payer mix, inventory levels in the distribution channel, shelf life of the product, and other relevant factors. calculating these provisions involves estimates and judgments. we review our estimates of rebates, chargebacks, and other applicable provisions each period and record any necessary adjustments in the current period's net product sales. the following table summarizes the provisions, and credits/payments, for sales-related deductions.

collaboration revenue we earn collaboration revenue in connection with collaboration agreements to develop and commercialize product candidates and utilize our technology platforms. these arrangements may require us to deliver various rights, services, and/or goods across the entire life cycle of a product or product candidate. the terms of these agreements typically include that consideration be provided to us in the form of non-refundable up-front payments, research progress (milestone) payments, payments for development and commercialization activities, and sharing of profits or losses arising from the commercialization of products. in arrangements involving multiple deliverables, we must determine whether each deliverable qualifies as a separate unit of accounting, whether the deliverables have value to the collaborator on a standalone basis, and how the consideration should be allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable. payments which are based on achieving a specific substantive performance milestone, involving a degree of risk, are recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved and the related payment is due and non-refundable, provided there is no future service obligation associated with that milestone. in determining whether a payment is deemed to be a substantive performance milestone, we take into consideration (i) the enhancement in value to the related development product candidate, (ii) our performance and the relative level of effort required to achieve the milestone, (iii) whether the milestone relates solely to past performance, and (iv) whether the milestone payment is considered reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms. payments for achieving milestones which are not considered substantive are deferred and recognized over the related performance period.
in connection with non-refundable licensing payments, our performance period estimates are principally based on projections of the scope, progress, and results of our research and development activities. due to the variability in the scope of activities and length of time necessary to develop a drug product, changes to development plans as programs progress, and uncertainty in the ultimate requirements to obtain governmental approval for commercialization, revisions to performance period estimates are likely to occur periodically, and could result in material changes to the amount of revenue recognized each year in the future. in addition, our estimated performance periods may change if development programs encounter delays, or we and our collaborators decide to expand or contract our clinical plans for a drug candidate in various disease indications.
when we are entitled to reimbursement of all or a portion of the research and development expenses that we incur under a collaboration, we record those reimbursable amounts as collaboration revenue proportionately as we recognize our expenses. if the collaboration is a cost-sharing arrangement in which both we and our collaborator perform development work and share costs, we also recognize, as additional research and development expense in the period when our collaborator incurs development expenses, the portion of the collaborator's development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse.
under our collaboration agreements, product sales and cost of sales for products which are currently approved are recorded by our collaborators. we share in any profits or losses arising from the commercialization of such products. our collaborator provides us with our estimated share of the profits or losses from commercialization of such products for the most recent fiscal quarter. our collaborators' estimates of profits or losses for such quarter are reconciled to actual profits or losses in the subsequent fiscal quarter, and our share of the profit or loss is adjusted accordingly, as necessary.
64
clinical trial expenses clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third-party contractors. we outsource a substantial portion of our clinical trial activities, utilizing external entities such as cros, independent clinical investigators, and other third-party service providers to assist us with the execution of our clinical studies. for each clinical trial that we conduct, certain clinical trial costs are expensed immediately, while others are expensed over time based on the expected total number of patients in the trial, the rate at which patients enter the trial, and/or the period over which clinical investigators or cros are expected to provide services.
clinical activities which relate principally to clinical sites and other administrative functions to manage our clinical trials are performed primarily by cros. cros typically perform most of the start-up activities for our trials, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training, and program management. on a budgeted basis, these start-up costs are typically 10% to 20% of the total contract value. on an actual basis, this percentage range can be significantly wider, as many of our contracts with cros are either expanded or reduced in scope compared to the original budget, while start-up costs for the particular trial may not change materially. these start-up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are event driven in nature. the remaining activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study. in the event of early termination of a clinical trial, we accrue and recognize expenses in an amount based on our estimate of the remaining non-cancelable obligations associated with the winding down of the clinical trial and/or penalties.
for clinical study sites, where payments are made periodically on a per-patient basis to the institutions performing the clinical study, we accrue expenses on an estimated cost-per-patient basis, based on subject enrollment and activity in each quarter. the amount of clinical study expense recognized in a quarter may vary from period to period based on the duration and progress of the study, the activities to be performed by the sites each quarter, the required level of patient enrollment, the rate at which patients actually enroll in and drop-out of the clinical study, and the number of sites involved in the study. clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in estimates are typically those that have a significant number of sites, require a large number of patients, have complex patient screening requirements, and span multiple years. during the course of a trial, we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates. our estimates and assumptions for clinical expense recognition could differ significantly from our actual results, which could cause material increases or decreases in research and development expenses in future periods when the actual results become known.
stock-based compensation we recognize stock-based compensation expense for grants of stock option awards and restricted stock under our long-term incentive plans to employees and non-employee members of our board of directors based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. the grant-date fair value of an award is generally recognized as compensation expense over the award's requisite service period.
we use the black-scholes model to compute the estimated fair value of stock option awards. using this model, fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to (i) expected volatility of our common stock price, (ii) the periods of time over which employees and members of our board of directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise (expected lives), (iii) expected dividend yield on our common stock, and (iv) risk-free interest rates, which are based on quoted u.s. treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the options' expected lives. expected volatility has been estimated based on actual movements in our stock price over the most recent historical periods equivalent to the options' expected lives. expected lives are principally based on our historical exercise experience with previously issued employee and board of directors option grants. the expected dividend yield is zero as we have never paid dividends and do not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future. stock-based compensation expense also includes an estimate, which is made at the time of grant, of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited. this estimate is revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
the assumptions used in computing the fair value of option awards reflect our best estimates but involve uncertainties related to market and other conditions, many of which are outside of our control. changes in any of these assumptions may materially affect the fair value of stock options granted and the amount of stock-based compensation recognized in future periods.
65
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts ("temporary differences") at enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. we periodically re-assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based on various factors including our historical earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, and forecasts of future operating results and utilization of net operating losses and tax credits prior to their expiration. significant judgment is required in making this assessment.
uncertain tax positions, for which management's assessment is that there is more than a 50% probability of sustaining the position upon challenge by a taxing authority based upon its technical merits, are subjected to certain recognition and measurement criteria. significant judgment is required in making this assessment, and therefore, we re-evaluate uncertain tax positions and consider various factors, including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. we adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the uncertain positions.
inventories we capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval when, based on management's judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized; otherwise, such costs are expensed as research and development. the determination to capitalize inventory costs is based on various factors, including status and expectations of the regulatory approval process, any known safety or efficacy concerns, potential labeling restrictions, and any other impediments to obtaining regulatory approval.
we periodically analyze our inventory levels to identify inventory that may expire prior to expected sale or has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value, and write-down such inventories as appropriate. in addition, our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process. if certain batches or units of product no longer meet quality specifications or become obsolete due to expiration, we record a charge to cost of goods sold to write down such unmarketable inventory to its estimated realizable value. in 2015, 2014, and 2013, cost of goods sold included inventory write-downs and reserves totaling $10.6 million, $6.0 million, and $9.1 million, respectively.

in 2015, sanofi's reimbursement of our antibody research and development expenses consisted of $145.0 million under our antibody discovery agreement and $590.4 million under our license and collaboration agreement, compared to $160.0 million and $387.8 million, respectively, in 2014. under the amended antibody discovery agreement, sanofi agreed to fund our antibody discovery activities up to $145.0 million in 2015 and up to $160.0 million in 2014. the higher reimbursement of development costs in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to increased development activities for dupilumab.
reimbursement of regeneron commercialization-related expenses represents reimbursement of internal and external costs in connection with preparing to commercialize or commercializing, as applicable, praluent and sarilumab. effective in the second and fourth quarters of 2014, we and sanofi began sharing pre-launch commercial expenses related to praluent and sarilumab, respectively, in accordance with the companies' license and collaboration agreement. consequently, we began recording our share of losses in connection with preparing to commercialize these two antibodies within sanofi collaboration revenue. as described in item 1. "business" above, in july 2015, the fda approved praluent in the united states and in september 2015, the european commission granted marketing authorization of praluent. therefore, commencing in 2015, we also recorded within sanofi collaboration revenue our share of the antibody collaboration's losses in connection with commercialization of praluent. we and sanofi incurred higher commercialization expenses for praluent in 2015 primarily in connection with launching the product in the united states. praluent net product sales, which are recorded by sanofi, were $10.5 million in 2015.
other sanofi antibody revenue includes recognition of deferred revenue from an $85.0 million up-front payment and other payments. as of december 31, 2015, $64.2 million of the up-front and other payments was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods.
in july 2015, we and sanofi entered into a global strategic collaboration to discover, develop, and commercialize antibody-based cancer treatments in the field of immuno-oncology (as described above under "collaboration agreements - collaboration with sanofi - immuno-oncology"). in 2015, sanofi's reimbursement of our immuno-oncology research and development expenses consisted of $29.2 million under our io discovery agreement and $10.8 million under our io license and collaboration agreement.
other sanofi immuno-oncology revenue includes recognition of deferred revenue from $640.0 million of up-front payments received in the third quarter of 2015 in connection with the execution of the io collaboration agreements. as of december 31, 2015, $600.0 million of the up-front payments was deferred and will be recognized ratably as revenue in future periods.
in september 2003, we and sanofi entered into a zaltrap collaboration agreement to jointly develop and commercialize zaltrap. under the terms of the zaltrap collaboration agreement, we and sanofi shared profits and losses on sales of
68
zaltrap outside of japan, and we were entitled to receive a percentage of sales of zaltrap in japan. our share of the loss in connection with the commercialization of zaltrap in 2014 represents our share of the costs of commercializing zaltrap, partly offset by net product sales. as described above in part i, item 1. "collaboration agreements - collaborations with sanofi - zaltrap", in february 2015, we entered into an amended zaltrap agreement with sanofi which amended and restated the zaltrap collaboration agreement. as a result, in the first quarter of 2015 we recognized $14.9 million of previously deferred revenue under the zaltrap collaboration agreement, related to (i) amounts that were previously reimbursed by sanofi for manufacturing commercial supplies of zaltrap since our risk of inventory loss under the collaboration no longer existed, and (ii) the unamortized portion of up-front payments from sanofi as we had no further performance obligations.
bayer healthcare collaboration revenue the collaboration revenue we earned from bayer healthcare, as detailed below, primarily consisted of recognition of our share of profits in connection with commercialization of eylea outside the united states, and recognition of sales milestones achieved.

regeneron's share of collaboration profit from sales outside the united states                                                         521.8                     358.3
reimbursement of eylea development expenses incurred by bayer healthcare in accordance with regeneron's payment obligation             (55.1     )               (57.0     )
regeneron's net profit in connection with commercialization of eylea outside the united states                                        $466.7                    $301.3
bayer healthcare records revenue from sales of eylea outside the united states. in 2015 and 2014, our share of the profit we earned from commercialization of eylea outside the united states was partly offset by our contractual obligation to reimburse bayer healthcare for a portion of the agreed-upon development expenses previously incurred by bayer healthcare.
69
in 2015, we earned our final $15.0 million sales milestone from bayer healthcare, upon total aggregate net sales of specific commercial supplies of eylea outside the united states exceeding $200 million over a twelve-month period. in 2014, we earned seven $15.0 million sales milestones from bayer healthcare upon total aggregate net sales of eylea outside the united states achieving certain specified levels.
cost-sharing of our global eylea development expenses with bayer healthcare decreased in 2015 compared to 2014. in january 2014, bayer healthcare decided to participate in the global development and commercialization of eylea outside the united states for the treatment of macular edema following brvo. in connection with this decision, bayer healthcare reimbursed us $15.7 million for a defined share of the eylea global development costs that we had incurred prior to february 2014 for the brvo indication, which was recognized as bayer healthcare collaboration revenue in the first quarter of 2014. in addition, all future agreed-upon global eylea development expenses incurred in connection with brvo are shared equally, and any future profits or losses on sales of eylea outside of the united states for the treatment of macular edema following brvo are also shared (for countries other than japan; we are entitled to receive a tiered percentage of eylea net sales in japan).
other eylea revenue primarily consists of reimbursement of other regeneron eylea expenses, principally related to bayer healthcare's share of royalties payable to genentech pursuant to a license and settlement agreement in connection with sales of eylea outside the united states and reimbursements for producing eylea commercial supplies for bayer healthcare. in addition, other eylea revenue includes recognition of deferred revenue related to eylea up-front and 2007 non-substantive milestone payments from bayer healthcare. as of december 31, 2015, $11.1 million of the eylea up-front and 2007 milestone payments was deferred and will be recognized ratably as revenue in future periods.
cost-sharing of regn2176-3 development expenses with bayer healthcare commenced in the first quarter of 2014 following the execution of the companies' pdgfr-beta antibody collaboration agreement. other pdgfr-beta antibody revenue consists of recognition of deferred revenue related to the pdgfr-beta up-front payment and non-substantive milestones received in the first quarter of 2014. as of december 31, 2015, $9.5 million of the pdgfr-beta up-front and 2014 milestone payments was deferred and will be recognized ratably as revenue in future periods.
other revenue in connection with the amendment and extension of our velocimmune license agreement with astellas, in august 2010, we received a $165.0 million up-front payment, which was deferred upon receipt and is being recognized as revenue ratably over a seven-year period beginning in june 2011. in both 2015 and 2014, we recognized $23.6 million of revenue related to this agreement. as of december 31, 2015, $57.4 million of the august 2010 technology licensing payment received from astellas was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods.
in connection with the february 2015 amended zaltrap agreement with sanofi, we recorded $38.8 million of revenue in 2015 primarily related to manufacturing zaltrap commercial supplies for sanofi and a percentage of net sales of zaltrap from july 1, 2014 (the effective date of the amended zaltrap agreement) through december 31, 2015, which sanofi is obligated to pay us.
in addition, under a june 2009 agreement with novartis, we receive royalties on worldwide sales of novartis' ilaris (canakinumab). in 2015 and 2014, other revenue included $8.9 million and $7.9 million, respectively, of royalties from novartis.
expenses total operating expenses increased to $2,851.8 million in 2015 from $1,995.6 million in 2014. our average headcount in 2015 increased to 3,713 from 2,629 in 2014, principally in connection with expanding our research and development, and commercialization activities.
operating expenses in 2015 and 2014 included a total of $459.0 million and $321.8 million, respectively, of non-cash compensation expense related to employee stock option and restricted stock awards (non-cash compensation expense). the increase in total non-cash compensation expense in 2015 was primarily attributable to the higher fair market value of our common stock on the date of our annual employee option grants made in december 2014 compared to recent prior years. as of december 31, 2015, unrecognized non-cash compensation expense related to outstanding stock options was $962.6 million and unvested restricted stock awards was $33.9 million. we expect to recognize this non-cash compensation expense over weighted-average periods of 2.0 years and 2.1 years, respectively.

research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to $1,620.6 million in 2015 from $1,271.4 million in 2014. the following table summarizes the major categories of our research and development expenses:
research and development expenses                                                              year ended december 31,              increase

payroll and benefits (1)                                                        $506.3                    $401.6                $104.7
clinical trial expenses                                                          306.1                     203.0                 103.1

research and other development costs                                             133.6                     137.2                  (3.6     )
occupancy and other operating costs                                              136.4                     116.5                  19.9
cost-sharing of bayer healthcare and sanofi development expenses (3)             106.4                     128.3                 (21.9     )
total research and development expenses                                       $1,620.6                  $1,271.4                $349.2
(1) includes non-cash compensation expense of $216.6 million in 2015 and $157.1 million in 2014.
(2) represents the full cost of manufacturing drug for use in research, preclinical development, and clinical trials, as well as pre-launch commercial supplies which were not capitalized as inventory. includes related payroll and benefits, non-cash compensation expense, manufacturing materials and supplies, drug filling, packaging, and labeling costs, depreciation, and occupancy costs of our rensselaer, new york manufacturing facility. also includes non-cash compensation expense of $39.1 million in 2015 and $27.2 million in 2014.
(3) under our collaborations with bayer healthcare and sanofi, in periods when bayer healthcare or sanofi incurs certain development expenses, we also recognize, as additional research and development expense, the portion of our collaborators' development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse. our collaborators provide us with estimated development expenses for the most recent fiscal quarter. bayer healthcare's and sanofi's estimates are reconciled to their actual expenses for such quarter in the subsequent fiscal quarter, and our portion of our collaborators' development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse is adjusted accordingly.
payroll and benefits increased principally due to the increase in employee headcount and non-cash compensation expense, as described above. clinical trial expenses increased primarily due to additional costs for clinical studies of dupilumab and fasinumab, partly offset by lower praluent, eylea, and regn1033 costs. clinical manufacturing costs increased primarily due to additional costs related to manufacturing drug supplies of dupilumab and, to a lesser extent, other late-stage antibody product candidates. research and other development costs decreased primarily due to our 50% share ($33.8 million) of the cost of purchasing an fda priority review voucher in 2014, partly offset by an increase in lab supplies in connection with early stage research activities. occupancy and other operating costs increased principally in connection with our higher headcount, expanded research and development activities, and higher information technology- and facility-related costs at our tarrytown and rensselaer, new york sites. cost-sharing of bayer healthcare and sanofi development expenses decreased primarily due to lower development costs incurred by bayer healthcare in connection with eylea and sanofi in connection with sarilumab.
71
we prepare estimates of research and development costs for projects in clinical development, which include direct costs and allocations of certain costs such as indirect labor, non-cash compensation expense, and manufacturing and other costs related to activities that benefit multiple projects, and, under our collaborations with bayer healthcare and sanofi, the portion of bayer healthcare's and sanofi's respective development expenses which they incur and we are obligated to reimburse. our estimates of research and development costs for clinical development programs are shown below:
project costs                                                               year ended december 31,              increase

drug development and approval in the united states is a multi-step process regulated by the fda. the process begins with discovery and preclinical evaluation, leading up to the submission of an ind to the fda which, if successful, allows the opportunity for study in humans, or clinical study, of the potential new drug. clinical development typically involves three phases of study: phases 1, 2, and 3. the most significant costs in clinical development are in phase 3 clinical trials, as they tend to be the longest and largest studies in the drug development process. following successful completion of phase 3 clinical trials for a biological product, a bla must be submitted to, and accepted by, the fda and the fda must approve the bla prior to commercialization of the drug. it is not uncommon for the fda to request additional data following its review of a bla, which can significantly increase the drug development timeline and expenses. we may elect either on our own, or at the request of the fda, to conduct further studies that are referred to as phase 3b and 4 studies. phase 3b studies are initiated and either completed or substantially completed while the bla is under fda review. these studies are conducted under an ind. phase 4 studies, also referred to as post-marketing studies, are studies that are initiated and conducted after the fda has approved a product for marketing. in addition, as discovery research, preclinical development, and clinical programs progress, opportunities to expand development of drug candidates into new disease indications can emerge. we may elect to add such new disease indications to our development efforts (with the approval of our collaborator for joint development programs), thereby extending the period in which we will be developing a product.
there are numerous uncertainties associated with drug development, including uncertainties related to safety and efficacy data from each phase of drug development, uncertainties related to the enrollment and performance of clinical trials, changes in regulatory requirements, changes in the competitive landscape affecting a product candidate, and other risks and uncertainties described in part i, item 1a, "risk factors." the lengthy process of seeking fda approvals, and subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. any failure by us to obtain, or delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business.
for these reasons and due to the variability in the costs necessary to develop a pharmaceutical product and the uncertainties related to future indications to be studied, the estimated cost and scope of the projects, and our ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization, accurate and meaningful estimates of the total cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available. similarly, we are currently unable to reasonably estimate if our product candidates in clinical development will generate material product revenues and net cash inflows.
selling, general, and administrative expenses selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to $838.5 million in 2015 from $519.3 million in 2014 primarily due to higher headcount and headcount-related costs, higher non-cash compensation expense principally for the reason described under "expenses" above, and higher commercialization-related expenses primarily associated with eylea and praluent. selling, general, and administrative expenses included $193.0 million and $134.7 million of non-cash compensation expense in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
72
selling, general and administrative expenses in 2014 included a $40.6 million incremental charge related to the branded prescription drug fee, which is a non-tax deductible annual fee imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs. in july 2014, the internal revenue service (irs) issued final regulations that provide guidance on the branded prescription drug fee. as a result of the issuance of these final irs regulations, an incremental charge was recorded to (i) recognize a liability for the estimated fee payable based on 2014 sales through the first nine months of 2014, and (ii) expense the remaining prepaid asset recorded under the previous accounting for the estimated fee payable based on 2013 sales. the impact of the 2014 incremental charge was offset by a higher branded prescription drug fee expense in 2015 due to higher sales of eylea in the united states.
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold was $241.7 million in 2015 and $129.0 million in 2014. cost of goods sold primarily consists of royalties, as well as costs in connection with producing u.s. eylea commercial supplies and various start-up costs in connection with our limerick, ireland commercial manufacturing facility. cost of goods sold increased principally due to the increase in u.s. eylea net sales, as well as an increase in limerick start-up costs. in addition, in 2015 and 2014, cost of goods sold included inventory write-downs and reserves totaling $10.6 million and $6.0 million, respectively.
cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing, which includes costs we incur in connection with producing commercial drug supplies for sanofi and bayer healthcare, increased to $151.0 million in 2015 from $76.0 million in 2014. this increase was primarily due to the recognition of costs associated with commercial supplies of zaltrap, as well as royalties payable to genentech in connection with higher sales of eylea outside the united states and the recognition of costs associated with commercial supplies of eylea manufactured for bayer healthcare. under our collaboration arrangements, when the product is sold by our collaborators to third-party customers, our risk of inventory loss no longer exists, and we therefore recognize our related manufacturing costs for the sold product as cost of collaboration manufacturing. however, as described above, in february 2015, we entered into an amended zaltrap agreement with sanofi. as a result, in the first quarter of 2015 we recognized as expense $20.2 million of inventoried costs for zaltrap commercial supplies that were previously shipped to sanofi because our risk of inventory loss no longer exists under the amended zaltrap agreement.
other income and expense total other expenses (net of other income) decreased to $26.8 million in 2015 from $62.7 million in 2014. interest expense in 2015 decreased compared to 2014 primarily due to conversions of a substantial portion of our notes in 2014 and 2015. in addition, in 2015 and 2014, we recognized a $18.9 million and a $33.5 million non-cash charge, respectively, in connection with notes which were surrendered for conversion during the respective periods.
income taxes in 2015, we recorded income tax expense of $589.0 million, based on an effective tax rate of 48.1%. the 2015 effective tax rate was negatively impacted, compared to the u.s. federal statutory rate, by losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions with rates lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate, partly offset by the positive impact of the domestic manufacturing deduction.
in 2014, we recorded income tax expense of $423.1 million, based on an effective tax rate of 55.6%. the 2014 effective tax rate was negatively impacted, compared to the u.s. federal statutory rate, by losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions with rates lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate and the non-tax deductible branded prescription drug fee. the negative impact of these items was partly offset by the positive impact of the federal tax credit for increased research activities and state income state credits.
we expect our effective tax rate to continue to be negatively impacted by a shift in our geographic mix of profits and losses in 2016.

our share of the zaltrap loss in 2014 and 2013 represents our share of the costs of launching and commercializing zaltrap, partly offset by net product sales.
in 2014, sanofi's reimbursement of our antibody research and development expenses consisted of $160.0 million under our antibody discovery agreement and $387.8 million under our license and collaboration agreement, compared to $160.0 million and $293.5 million, respectively, in 2013. under the amended antibody discovery agreement, sanofi agreed to fund up to $160.0 million of our antibody discovery activities in 2014 and 2013. the higher reimbursement of development costs in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to increased development activities for dupilumab, praluent, and certain other, earlier-stage antibody product candidates.
reimbursement of regeneron commercialization-related expenses represents reimbursement of internal and external costs in connection with preparing to commercialize antibody product candidates. these revenues increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to higher commercialization activities related to praluent.
during 2014, we and sanofi began sharing pre-launch commercialization expenses related to praluent and sarilumab in accordance with the companies' antibody collaboration agreement. as a result, we began recording our share of losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies.
in 2013, we acquired from sanofi full exclusive rights to two families of novel antibodies invented at regeneron and previously included in our antibody collaboration with sanofi. in connection with acquiring from sanofi full exclusive rights to (i) antibodies targeting the pdgf family of receptors and ligands in ophthalmology and all other indications and (ii) antibodies targeting the ang2 receptor and ligand in ophthalmology, we made two $10.0 million up-front payments to sanofi.
75
other antibody revenue relates primarily to recognition of deferred revenue from an $85.0 million up-front payment and other payments.
bayer healthcare collaboration revenue the collaboration revenue we earned from bayer healthcare, as detailed below, primarily consisted of recognition of our share of profits in connection with commercialization of eylea outside the united states, and recognition of sales and substantive development milestones achieved.

bayer healthcare records revenue from sales of eylea outside the united states. in 2014 and 2013, our share of the profit we earned from commercialization of eylea outside the united states was partly offset by our contractual obligation to reimburse bayer healthcare for a portion of the agreed-upon development expenses previously incurred by bayer healthcare.
in 2014, we earned, and recorded as revenue, six $15.0 million sales milestones from bayer healthcare upon total aggregate net sales of eylea outside the united states exceeding $500 million, $600 million, $700 million, $800 million, $900 million, and $1 billion, respectively, over a twelve-month period. additionally, in 2014, we earned a $15.0 million sales milestone from bayer healthcare upon total aggregate net sales of specific commercial supplies of eylea outside the united states exceeding $100 million over a twelve-month period. in 2013, we earned $15.0 million and $10.0 million substantive development milestones from bayer healthcare upon receipt of marketing and pricing approval, respectively, outside the united states for eylea for

the treatment of macular edema secondary to crvo. in addition, we earned, and recorded as revenue in 2013, three $15.0 million sales milestones from bayer healthcare upon total aggregate net sales of eylea outside the united states exceeding $200 million, $300 million, and $400 million, respectively, over a twelve-month period.
cost-sharing of our global eylea development expenses with bayer healthcare increased slightly in 2014 compared to 2013. in january 2014, bayer healthcare decided to participate in the global development and commercialization of eylea outside the united states for the treatment of macular edema following brvo. in connection with this decision, bayer healthcare reimbursed us $15.7 million for a defined share of the eylea global development costs that we had incurred prior to february 2014 for the brvo indication, which was recognized as bayer healthcare collaboration revenue in the first quarter of 2014. this 2014 increase was partly offset by the winding down of various eylea development activities.
other eylea revenue increased principally due to higher reimbursement of other regeneron eylea expenses, primarily related to bayer healthcare's share of royalties payable to genentech which commenced in may 2013 pursuant to a license and settlement agreement, in connection with sales of eylea outside the united states. other eylea revenue also includes recognition of deferred revenue related to eylea up-front and 2007 non-substantive milestone payments from bayer healthcare.
cost-sharing of regn2176-3 development expenses with bayer healthcare commenced in the first quarter of 2014 following the execution of the companies' pdgfr-beta antibody collaboration agreement. other pdgfr-beta antibody revenue consists of recognition of deferred revenue related to the pdgfr-beta up-front payment and non-substantive milestones received in the first quarter of 2014.
other revenue in connection with the amendment and extension of our velocimmune license agreement with astellas, in august 2010, we received a $165.0 million up-front payment, which was deferred upon receipt and is being recognized as revenue ratably over a seven-year period beginning in june 2011. in both 2014 and 2013, we recognized $23.6 million of other revenue related to this agreement.
in addition, under a june 2009 agreement with novartis, we receive royalties on worldwide sales of novartis' ilaris. in 2014 and 2013, other revenue included $7.9 million and $4.8 million, respectively, of royalties from novartis.
expenses total operating expenses increased to $1,995.6 million in 2014 from $1,361.7 million in 2013. our average headcount in 2014 increased to 2,629 from 2,153 in 2013, principally in connection with expanding our research and development, and commercialization activities.
operating expenses in 2014 and 2013 included a total of $321.8 million and $215.4 million, respectively, of non-cash compensation expense. the increase in total non-cash compensation expense in 2014 was primarily attributable to the higher fair market value of our common stock on the date of our annual employee option grants made in december 2013 compared to recent prior years.

research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to $1,271.4 million in 2014 from $859.9 million in 2013. the following table summarizes the major categories of our research and development expenses in 2014 and 2013:
research and development expenses                                                            year ended december 31,              increase

(1) includes non-cash compensation expense of $157.1 million in 2014 and $101.9 million in 2013.
(2) represents the full cost of manufacturing drug for use in research, preclinical development, and clinical trials, as well as pre-launch commercial supplies which were not capitalized as inventory. includes related payroll and benefits, non-cash compensation expense, manufacturing materials and supplies, drug filling, packaging, and labeling costs, depreciation, and occupancy costs of our rensselaer, new york manufacturing facility. also includes non-cash compensation expense of $27.2 million in 2014 and $14.6 million in 2013.
(3) under our collaborations with bayer healthcare and sanofi, in periods when bayer healthcare or sanofi incurs certain development expenses, we also recognize, as additional research and development expense, the portion of our collaborators' development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse. our collaborators provide us with estimated development expenses for the most recent fiscal quarter. bayer healthcare's and sanofi's estimates are reconciled to their actual expenses for such quarter in the subsequent fiscal quarter, and our portion of our collaborators' development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse is adjusted accordingly.
payroll and benefits increased principally due to the increase in employee headcount and non-cash compensation expense, as described above. clinical trial expenses increased due primarily to additional costs for clinical studies of dupilumab and regn1033, partly offset by lower eylea-related costs. clinical manufacturing costs increased primarily due to additional costs related to manufacturing drug supplies of praluent. research and other development costs increased primarily due to our 50% share ($33.8 million) of the cost of purchasing an fda priority review voucher in 2014 and two $5.0 million development milestone payments we made to sanofi in 2014 in connection with our acquisition from sanofi of full exclusive rights to antibodies targeting the pdgf family of receptors in may 2013. occupancy and other operating costs increased principally in connection with our higher headcount, expanded research and development activities, and higher information technology and facility-related costs at our tarrytown and rensselaer, new york sites. cost-sharing of bayer healthcare and sanofi development expenses increased primarily due to our obligation to fund 20% of sanofi's phase 3 praluent and sarilumab development costs, which commenced during the fourth quarter of 2013.
78
we prepare estimates of research and development costs for projects in clinical development, which include direct costs and allocations of certain costs such as indirect labor, non-cash compensation expense, and manufacturing and other costs related to activities that benefit multiple projects, and, under our collaborations with bayer healthcare and sanofi, the portion of bayer healthcare and sanofi's development expenses which they incur and we are obligated to reimburse. our estimates of research and development costs for clinical development programs are shown below:

selling, general, and administrative expenses selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to $519.3 million in 2014 from $346.4 million in 2013 primarily due to higher costs associated with the branded prescription drug fee, higher non-cash compensation expense principally for the reason described under "expenses" above, higher headcount and headcount-related costs, and higher legal costs primarily in connection with patent enforcement. the increase in the branded prescription drug fee was primarily related to a $40.6 million incremental charge which was recorded in the third quarter of 2014, as described above under "results of operations - years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 - selling, general, and administrative expenses."
selling, general, and administrative expenses included $134.7 million and $97.0 million of non-cash compensation expense in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold was $129.0 million in 2014 and $118.0 million in 2013. cost of goods sold, which primarily consists of royalties, as well as costs in connection with producing eylea and arcalyst commercial supplies, increased principally due to the increase in u.s. eylea net sales. in addition, in 2014 and 2013, cost of goods sold included inventory write-downs and reserves totaling $6.0 million and $9.1 million, respectively.
cost of collaboration manufacturing we manufacture commercial supplies of product for our collaborators. cost of collaboration manufacturing increased to $76.0 million in 2014 from $37.3 million in 2013 primarily due to royalties payable to genentech, which commenced in may 2013 pursuant to a license and settlement agreement, in connection with sales of eylea outside the united states. cost of collaboration manufacturing also includes costs in connection with producing commercial supplies for our collaborators.
other income and expense total other expenses (net of other income) increased to $62.7 million in 2014 from $46.7 million in 2013. in 2014, we had investment and other income of $8.2 million, compared to investment and other expense of $0.2 million in 2013. in 2013, we recorded a $2.9 million other-than-temporary impairment of an equity security based upon the length of time that the security was in an unrealized loss position and our expectation that we will not hold the security until a potential recovery in value occurs. this impairment charge exceeded investment income earned in 2013 on our marketable securities.
interest expense in 2014 and 2013 includes interest associated with our notes, including amortization of the note discount and debt issuance costs, and interest associated with our facility lease obligations. interest expense in 2014 decreased compared to 2013 primarily due to $230.6 million principal amount of our notes which were surrendered for conversion during 2014. in addition, in 2014, we recognized a $33.5 million non-cash charge in connection with these conversions.

income taxes in 2014, we recorded income tax expense of $423.1 million, based on an effective tax rate of 55.6%. the 2014 effective tax rate was negatively impacted, compared to the u.s. federal statutory rate, by losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions with rates lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate and the non-tax deductible branded prescription drug fee. in addition, new york state tax legislation enacted in the first quarter of 2014 reduced the new york state income tax rate to zero percent for "qualified manufacturers", including regeneron, effective in 2014; however, it also resulted in the reduction of our related deferred tax assets as a discrete item in the first quarter of 2014. as a result, this tax legislation caused a net increase in our effective tax rate by less than 1.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014. the negative impact of these items was partly offset by the positive impact of the federal tax credit for increased research activities and state income tax credits.
in 2013, we recorded income tax expense of $282.6 million, based on an effective tax rate of 40.6%. the 2013 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by increases related to state and local taxes, the non-deductible branded prescription drug fee, and losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions with rates lower than the federal statutory rate. these increases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by federal and state income tax credits. in january 2013, the american taxpayer relief act was enacted, which included a provision to extend the income tax credit for increased research activities retroactively to the tax year ended december 31, 2012, as well as for 2013. as a result of the extension, during 2013, we recognized the benefit of both the 2012 and 2013 federal research tax credit.
liquidity and capital resources the sources and uses of cash discussion below reflects certain revisions to previously-issued financial statements. see note 1 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of such revisions.
sources and uses of cash for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013
as of december 31, 2015, we had $1,677.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities compared with $1,360.6 million as of december 31, 2014 and $1,083.9 million as of december 31, 2013. additionally, as of december 31, 2015, we had borrowing availability of $750.0 million under a revolving credit facility that was entered into during the first quarter of 2015 (see further description under "credit facility" below).

as of december 31, 2015, sanofi, bayer healthcare, and trade accounts receivable increased by $491.4 million, compared to december 31, 2014, primarily due to higher u.s. eylea sales. inventories as of december 31, 2015 increased by $111.8 million, compared to december 31, 2014, primarily due to increased production of eylea commercial supplies as well as capitalization of inventory in connection with praluent production. prepaid expenses and other assets increased by $79.5 million as of december 31, 2015, compared to december 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase in prepaid income taxes. deferred revenue increased by $608.9 million as of december 31, 2015, compared to december 31, 2014, primarily due to $640.0 million of up-front payments received from sanofi in connection with the companies' io collaboration, partly offset by related amortization which commenced in the third quarter of 2015. accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities increased by $303.7 million as of december 31, 2015, compared to december 31, 2014, primarily due to (i) higher accruals for sales-related charges and deductions, and royalties related to eylea, (ii) higher expenditures in connection with our expanding research and development activities, (iii) higher payroll and payroll-related costs, and (iv) higher tax-related liabilities.
2014. net cash provided by operating activities was $752.4 million in 2014. our net income of $338.1 million in 2014 included the following non-cash expenses: (i) non-cash compensation expense of $321.8 million, (ii) depreciation and amortization of $52.7 million, and (iii) a $33.5 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the conversion of our notes during 2014. in addition, deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2014 increased by $53.3 million, compared to end-of-year 2013, primarily due to an increase in non-cash compensation expense partly offset by the reduction of our deferred tax assets related to the recently enacted new york state tax legislation, which reduced our new york state income tax rate to zero percent effective in 2014.
as of december 31, 2014, sanofi, bayer healthcare, and trade accounts receivable increased by $34.9 million, compared to end-of-year 2013, primarily due to higher amounts receivable from bayer healthcare in connection with the commercialization of eylea outside the united states, partly offset by lower trade accounts receivable resulting from shortened payment terms to certain of our u.s. eylea customers effective january 2014. inventories increased by $56.9 million, compared to end-of-year
80
2013, primarily in connection with increased production of eylea commercial supplies. accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities increased by $161.2 million as of december 31, 2014, compared to end-of-year 2013, primarily due to (i) higher accruals for sales-related charges (including the impact of the branded prescription drug fee incremental charge as described above), deductions, and royalties related to eylea, (ii) higher payroll-related liabilities primarily driven by an increase in headcount, and (iii) higher expenditures in connection with our expanding research and development activities.
2013. net cash provided by operating activities was $588.6 million in 2013. our net income of $413.7 million in 2013 included non-cash compensation expense of $215.4 million and depreciation and amortization of $41.2 million. in addition, deferred tax assets at december 31, 2013 decreased by $62.2 million, compared to end-of-year 2012, primarily due to utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to offset income taxes payable during 2013.
as of december 31, 2013, sanofi, bayer healthcare, and trade accounts receivable increased by $245.5 million, compared to end-of-year 2012, primarily due to higher trade accounts receivable in connection with eylea product sales and a higher receivable balance due from bayer healthcare in connection with the commercialization of eylea outside the united states. inventories increased by $48.0 million, compared to end-of-year 2012, primarily in connection with increased production of eylea commercial supplies. our deferred revenue as of december 31, 2013 decreased by $41.5 million, compared to end-of-year 2012, primarily due to amortization of a previously received and deferred $165.0 million payment under our license agreement with astellas and amortization of previously deferred payments under our sanofi and bayer healthcare collaborations. accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities increased by $136.7 million as of december 31, 2013, compared to end-of-year 2012, primarily due to (i) higher sales-related charges, deductions, and royalties related to eylea, (ii) higher payroll-related liabilities, due in part to funding payment of our year-end 2012 employee cash bonuses in 2012, whereas year-end 2013 employee cash bonuses were accrued in 2013 and paid in 2014, and (iii) higher expenditures in connection with our expanding commercial and research and development activities.
cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $907.6 million, $420.8 million, and $355.5 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. in 2015, 2014, and 2013, purchases of marketable securities exceeded sales or maturities by $229.7 million, $87.8 million, and $199.1 million, respectively. capital expenditures were $677.9 million, $333.0 million, and $156.3 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. capital expenditures in 2015 included costs in connection with renovations of our limerick, ireland manufacturing facility, tenant improvement and associated costs related to two new buildings at our leased tarrytown, new york facilities, and expansion of our rensselaer, new york manufacturing facilities. in addition, in april 2015, we acquired an approximate 100-acre parcel of undeveloped land adjacent to our current tarrytown, new york location for an aggregate purchase price of $73.0 million. we intend to develop this property to accommodate and support our growth, primarily in connection with expanding our existing research and development and office space. capital expenditures in 2014 and 2013 included costs in connection with expanding our rensselaer, new york manufacturing facilities and tenant improvement and associated costs related to our leased facilities in tarrytown, new york; in addition, capital expenditures in 2014 included costs in connection with the acquisition and renovations of our limerick, ireland manufacturing facility.

the credit agreement contains financial and operating covenants. financial covenants include a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest expense coverage ratio. we were in compliance with all covenants of the credit facility as of december 31, 2015.
collaborations with sanofi antibodies as described above under item 1. "business - collaboration agreements - collaborations with sanofi," since november 2007, we and sanofi have been parties to a global, strategic collaboration to discover, develop, and commercialize fully human monoclonal antibodies. pursuant to the antibody collaboration, sanofi was responsible for funding up to $160.0 million per year of our antibody discovery activities over the period from 2010-2014, and, as amended in connection with the companies' july 2015 io collaboration as described below, is responsible for funding up to $145.0 million in 2015, and up to $130.0 million in each of 2016 and 2017 to identify and validate potential drug discovery targets and develop fully human monoclonal antibodies against these targets. for each drug candidate identified through discovery research under the antibody discovery agreement, sanofi has the option to license rights to the candidate under the license and collaboration agreement. under certain defined circumstances, upon exercising its option to license rights to particular candidates, sanofi must make a $10.0 million substantive milestone payment to us.
under the license and collaboration agreement, agreed-upon worldwide development expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement are funded by sanofi, except that following receipt of the first positive phase 3 trial results for a co-developed drug candidate, subsequent phase 3 trial-related costs for that drug candidate (called shared phase 3 trial costs) are shared 80% by sanofi and 20% by us. consequently, we recognized as additional research and development expense $92.6 million, $109.7 million, and $17.6 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, of antibody development expenses that we were obligated to reimburse to sanofi related to praluent and sarilumab. if the collaboration becomes profitable, we will be obligated to reimburse sanofi for 50% of worldwide development expenses that were fully funded by sanofi and 30% of shared phase 3 trial costs, in accordance with a defined formula based on the amounts of these expenses and our share of the collaboration profits from commercialization of collaboration products. however, we are not required to apply more than 10% of our share of the profits from collaboration products in any calendar quarter towards reimbursing sanofi for these development costs. our contingent reimbursement obligation to sanofi in connection with the companies' antibody collaboration was approximately $1,832 million as of december 31, 2015. if sanofi does not exercise its option to license rights to a particular drug candidate under the license and collaboration agreement, or, if sanofi elects not to continue to co-develop the product candidate, we retain the exclusive right to develop and commercialize such drug candidate, and sanofi will receive either a mid-single digit or 10% royalty on sales, if any. see item 1. "business - general," above for product candidates that are subject to potential future royalties.
as it relates to commercialization activities, we and sanofi equally share profits and losses within the united states. we and sanofi share profits outside the united states on a sliding scale based on sales starting at 65% (sanofi)/35% (us) and ending at 55% (sanofi)/45% (us), and share losses outside the united states at 55% (sanofi)/45% (us). in addition to profit sharing, we are entitled to receive up to $250.0 million in sales milestone payments, with milestone payments commencing after aggregate annual sales outside the united states exceed $1.0 billion on a rolling 12-month basis.
we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply clinical requirements of each drug candidate under the collaboration until commercial supplies of that drug candidate are being manufactured. during 2014, sanofi agreed to fund up to $17.5 million of agreed-upon costs incurred by us in connection with expanding manufacturing capacity at our rensselaer, new york facility.
with respect to each antibody product which enters development under the license and collaboration agreement, sanofi or we may, by giving twelve months notice, opt-out of further development and/or commercialization of the product, in which event the other party retains exclusive rights to continue the development and/or commercialization of the product. we may also opt-out of the further development of an antibody product if we give notice to sanofi within thirty days of the date that sanofi elects to jointly develop such antibody product under the license and collaboration agreement. each of the antibody discovery agreement and the license and collaboration agreement contains other termination provisions, including for material breach by the other party. prior to december 31, 2017, sanofi has the right to terminate the discovery agreement without cause with at least
82
three months' advance written notice; however, except under defined circumstances, sanofi would be obligated to immediately pay to us the full amount of unpaid research funding during the remaining term of the research agreement through december 31, 2017. upon termination of the antibody collaboration in its entirety, our obligation to reimburse sanofi for development costs out of any future profits from collaboration products will terminate. in the event of termination of the amended antibody discovery agreement, we retain exclusive rights to continue the development and/or commercialization of such product(s).
immuno-oncology as described above under item 1. "business - collaboration agreements - collaborations with sanofi," in july 2015, we and sanofi entered into a global strategic collaboration to discover, develop, and commercialize antibody-based cancer treatments in the field of immuno-oncology. the io collaboration is governed by an io discovery agreement and an io license and collaboration agreement. in connection with the io discovery agreement, sanofi made a $265.0 million non-refundable up-front payment to us. pursuant to the io discovery agreement, we will spend up to $1,090.0 million to identify and validate potential immuno-oncology targets and develop therapeutic antibodies against such targets through clinical proof-of-concept. sanofi will reimburse us for up to $825.0 million of these costs, subject to certain annual limits (including an annual limit of $150.0 million in 2016), to identify and validate potential immuno-oncology targets and develop therapeutic antibodies against such targets through clinical proof-of-concept. we will reimburse sanofi for half of the development costs they funded that are attributable to clinical development of antibody product candidates under the io discovery agreement from our share of future profits, if any, from commercialized products to the extent they are sufficient for this purpose. however, we are not required to apply more than 10% of our share of the profits from io collaboration products in any calendar quarter towards reimbursing sanofi for these development costs. with regard to product candidates for which proof-of-concept is established, sanofi will have the option to license rights to the product candidate pursuant to the io license and collaboration agreement (as further described below). if sanofi does not exercise its option to license rights to a product candidate, we will retain the exclusive right to develop and commercialize such product candidate and sanofi will be entitled to receive a royalty on sales.
in connection with the io license and collaboration agreement, sanofi made a $375.0 million non-refundable up-front payment to us. if sanofi exercises its option to license rights to a product candidate thereunder, it will co-develop the drug candidate with us through product approval. principal control of development of each product candidate that enters development under the io license and collaboration agreement will alternate between us and sanofi on a candidate-by-candidate basis. sanofi will fund drug candidate development costs up front for the candidates for which it is the principal controlling party and we will reimburse half of the total development costs for all such candidates from our share of future profits to the extent they are sufficient for this purpose, subject to the same 10% reimbursement limitation described above. in addition, we and sanofi will share equally, on an ongoing basis, the development costs for the drug candidates for which we are the principal controlling party. the parties will share equally in profits and losses in connection with the commercialization of collaboration products. we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply clinical requirements of each drug candidate under the io license and collaboration agreement until commercial supplies of that io drug candidate are being manufactured.
under the terms of the io license and collaboration agreement, the parties will also co-develop our antibody product candidate targeting pd-1 (regn2810). the parties will share equally, on an ongoing basis, development expenses for regn2810 up to a total of $650.0 million. we will be entitled to a milestone payment of $375.0 million in the event that sales of all licensed products targeting pd-1 (including regn2810), together with sales of any other products licensed under the io license and collaboration agreement and sold for use in combination with a licensed product targeting pd-1, equal or exceed $2.0 billion in any consecutive twelve-month period.
with respect to each product candidate that enters development under the io license and collaboration agreement, we or sanofi may, by giving twelve months' notice, opt-out of further development and/or commercialization of the product, in which event the other party will retain exclusive rights to continue the development and/or commercialization of such product.
collaborations with bayer healthcare eylea outside the united states as described above under item 1. "business - collaboration agreements - collaborations with bayer healthcare," since october 2006, we and bayer healthcare have been parties to a license and collaboration agreement for the global development and commercialization outside the united states of eylea.
83
bayer healthcare markets eylea outside the united states, where, for countries other than japan, the companies share equally in profits and losses from sales of eylea. in japan, we are entitled to receive a tiered percentage of between 33.5% and 40.0% of eylea net sales. we are obligated to reimburse bayer healthcare out of our share of the collaboration profits (including our percentage of sales of eylea in japan) for 50% of the agreed-upon development expenses that bayer healthcare has incurred in accordance with a formula based on the amount of development expenses that bayer healthcare has incurred and our share of the collaboration profits, or at a faster rate at our option. as a result, we expect that a portion of our share of eylea profits outside the united states will be partly used to reimburse bayer healthcare for this repayment obligation. in particular, our contingent reimbursement obligation to bayer healthcare for eylea was approximately $258 million as of december 31, 2015. we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply clinical and commercial bulk product of eylea to bayer healthcare.
since inception of the agreement, we have earned $110.0 million of development milestones and $165.0 million of sales milestones from bayer healthcare. during the first quarter of 2015, we earned the final potential milestone payment under our bayer healthcare collaboration agreement in connection with eylea outside the united states.
under the terms of the agreement, since 2009, all agreed-upon eylea development expenses incurred by both companies under a global development plan, and certain commercialization and other expenses, are shared equally, and profits or losses on sales of eylea outside the united states are also shared. we recognized as additional research and development expense $13.7 million, $18.6 million, and $15.3 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, of eylea development expenses that we were obligated to reimburse to bayer healthcare related to eylea development costs.
bayer healthcare has the right to terminate the agreement without cause with at least six months' or twelve months' advance notice depending on defined circumstances at the time of termination. in the event of termination of the agreement for any reason, we retain all rights to eylea.
pdgfr-beta antibody outside the united states as described above under item 1. "business - collaboration agreements - collaborations with bayer healthcare," in january 2014, we entered into an agreement with bayer healthcare governing the joint development and commercialization outside the united states of an antibody product candidate to pdgfr-beta, including in combination with aflibercept, for the treatment of ocular diseases or disorders. regn2176-3, a combination product candidate comprised of an antibody to pdgfr-beta co-formulated with aflibercept, is being developed under the agreement. under the agreement, we will conduct the initial development of the pdgfr-beta antibody through completion of the first proof-of-concept study, upon which bayer healthcare will have a right to opt-in to license and collaborate on further development and commercialization outside the united states.
in connection with the agreement, bayer healthcare is obligated to pay 25% of global development costs and 50% of development costs exclusively for the territory outside the united states under the initial development plan. in addition, bayer healthcare is obligated to reimburse us for 50% of development milestone payments to sanofi related to our acquisition of rights to antibodies targeting the pdgf family of receptors in may 2013. in that regard, bayer healthcare made two $2.5 million development milestone payments to us in 2014 and a $5.0 million development milestone payment to us in 2015. we are eligible to receive up to a $10.0 million additional future development milestone payment from bayer healthcare, although this payment could be reduced by half if bayer healthcare does not opt-in to the collaboration.
if bayer healthcare exercises its right to opt-in to the collaboration, they will obtain exclusive commercialization rights to the product outside the united states, continue to pay for 25% of global development costs and 50% of development costs exclusively for the territory outside the united states, pay a $20.0 million opt-in payment to us, pay a $20.0 million development milestone to us upon receipt of the first marketing approval in the eu or japan, share profits and losses from sales outside the united states equally with us, and be responsible for the payment of royalties on sales outside the united states to sanofi.
we also have the right to opt-out of the collaboration upon completion of the first proof-of-concept study for the pdgfr-beta antibody. if we opt-out of the collaboration and bayer healthcare exercises its right to opt-in to the collaboration, bayer healthcare will obtain exclusive rights to the pdgfr-beta antibody (except as a combination product with aflibercept) outside of the united states, be responsible for all development costs outside of the united states, be responsible for all royalty and milestone payments to a third party, and will retain all of the profits from sales of the pdgfr-beta antibody outside of the united states.
unless terminated earlier in accordance with its provisions, the agreement will continue to be in effect until such time as neither party or its respective affiliates or sublicensees is developing or commercializing a pdgfr-beta antibody in the specified field outside of the united states and such discontinuation is acknowledged as permanent by both us and bayer healthcare in writing.
fasinumab collaboration with mitsubishi tanabe pharma as described above under item 1. "business - collaboration agreements - collaborations with mitsubishi tanabe pharma," in september 2015, we and mtpc entered into a collaboration agreement providing mtpc with development and commercial
84
rights to fasinumab in japan and certain other countries in asia. in connection with the agreement, mtpc made a $10.0 million non-refundable up-front payment to us in 2015, and in the first quarter of 2016, mtpc became obligated to make an additional $45.0 million payment to us. we are also entitled to receive up to an aggregate of $65.0 million in development milestones if achieved by us and $105.0 million in other contingent payments, primarily related to development milestones achieved by mtpc.
under the agreement, we are obligated to manufacture and supply mtpc with clinical and commercial supplies of fasinumab. if fasinumab is commercialized in the mtpc territories, we will supply the product to mtpc at a tiered purchase price, which ranges from 30% to 50% of net sales of the product (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances), and are eligible for additional payments up to an aggregate of $100.0 million upon the achievement of specified annual net sales amounts starting at $200 million.
license agreement with astellas in july 2010, the non-exclusive license agreement with astellas was amended and extended through june 2023. under the terms of the amended agreement, astellas made a $165.0 million up-front payment to us in august 2010. in addition, astellas will make a $130.0 million second payment to us in june 2018 unless the license agreement has been terminated prior to that date. astellas has the right to terminate the agreement at any time by providing 90 days' advance written notice. under certain limited circumstances, such as our material breach of the agreement, astellas may terminate the agreement and receive a refund of a portion of its up-front payment or, if such termination occurs after june 2018, a portion of its second payment, to us under the july 2010 amendment to the agreement. we are entitled to receive a mid-single digit royalty on any future sales of antibody products discovered by astellas using our velocimmune technology.
royalty agreement with novartis pharma ag under a june 2009 agreement with novartis (which replaced a previous collaboration and license agreement), we receive royalties on worldwide sales of novartis' ilaris, a fully human anti-interleukin-il1ß antibody. the royalty rates in the agreement start at 4% and reach 15% when annual sales exceed $1.5 billion. ilaris is marketed for the treatment of caps and gouty arthritis, and is in earlier stage development for other inflammatory diseases. we are unable to predict whether these royalties will ever contribute materially to our results of operations or financial condition.
license and settlement agreements with genentech in december 2011, we entered into a non-exclusive license and partial settlement agreement with genentech (the original genentech agreement) that covered making, using, and selling eylea in the united states for the prevention and treatment of human eye diseases and disorders in the united states, and ended the litigation relating to those matters. the original genentech agreement provided for us to make payments to genentech based on u.s. sales of eylea through may 7, 2016, the date the davis-smyth patents expire. under the original genentech agreement, we made a $60.0 million milestone payment when cumulative u.s. sales reached $400 million and are obligated to pay royalties of 4.75% on cumulative relevant sales of eylea between $400 million and $3 billion and 5.5% on cumulative relevant sales of eylea over $3 billion.
in may 2013, we entered into an amended and restated non-exclusive license and settlement agreement with genentech (the amended genentech agreement), which amended the original genentech agreement to include all sales of eylea worldwide and ended the litigation relating to those matters. under the amended genentech agreement, we received a worldwide non-exclusive license to the davis-smyth patents, and certain other patents, owned or co-owned by genentech for the prevention or treatment of human eye diseases and eye disorders through administration of eylea to the eye. under the amended genentech agreement, we are obligated to make payments to genentech based on sales of eylea in the united states and eylea manufactured in the united states and sold outside the united states through may 7, 2016 using the same milestone and royalty rates as in the original genentech agreement. eylea is sold outside the united states by affiliates of bayer healthcare under our license and collaboration agreement. all payments to genentech under the original genentech agreement and the amended genentech agreement have been or will be made by regeneron. bayer healthcare will share in all such payments based on the proportion of eylea sales outside the united states to worldwide eylea sales and determined consistent with the license and collaboration agreement.
also in may 2013, we entered into a non-exclusive license and settlement agreement, with genentech, sanofi u.s. services, inc. and sanofi-aventis u.s. llc (the latter two entities, collectively, sanofi) under which we and sanofi received a worldwide non-exclusive license to the davis-smyth patents, and certain other patents, in all indications for human use other than the prevention or treatment of eye diseases and eye disorders through administration to the eye. under the terms of the agreement, payments are required to be made to genentech based on sales of zaltrap in the united states and of zaltrap that is manufactured in the united states and sold outside the united states through may 7, 2016. as a result of the amended zaltrap agreement, which is described in item 1. "business" above, we are no longer required to share in the cost of any payments made by sanofi to genentech based on sales of zaltrap.

tarrytown, new york leases we lease approximately 1,108,000 square feet of laboratory and office space at facilities in tarrytown, new york. in 2013, we entered into a lease agreement for approximately 297,000 square feet of laboratory and office space to be constructed in two new buildings, which were completed in 2015. our tarrytown leases expire in 2024 - 2029, but contain renewal options to extend the term of the leases, as well as early termination options on approximately 225,000 square feet of space. the tarrytown leases provide for current monthly base rental charges of approximately $3,525,000 (subject to escalations at 2.5% per annum) and additional charges for utilities, real estate taxes, and operating expenses, as defined.
certain leased premises are accounted for as operating leases. however, for certain other buildings that we are leasing (related to approximately 660,000 square feet), we are deemed, in substance, to be the owner of the landlord's buildings in accordance with the application of financial accounting standards board (fasb) authoritative guidance. consequently, in addition to capitalizing the tenant improvements, we capitalize the landlord's costs of constructing these new facilities, offset by a corresponding facility lease obligation. in addition, we recognize, as additional facility lease obligation, reimbursements from our landlord for tenant improvement costs that we incurred since, under fasb authoritative guidance, such payments that we receive from our landlord are deemed to be a financing obligation. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, the facility lease obligation balance related to these buildings was $364.7 million and $312.3 million, respectively.
capital expenditures our cash expenditures for property, plant, and equipment totaled $677.9 million in 2015, $333.0 million in 2014, and $156.3 million in 2013 (as described under "cash used in investing activities" above). we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $580 million to $680 million in 2016 primarily in connection with renovating our new limerick, ireland facility, tenant improvements primarily related to buildings at our leased tarrytown, new york facilities, and expanding and renovating a portion of our manufacturing facilities at our rensselaer, new york facility.
convertible senior notes in october 2011, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes in a private placement. the notes pay interest semi-annually on april 1 and october 1, and will mature on october 1, 2016, unless earlier converted (which can occur subject to certain conditions) or repurchased. the notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our option. the notes initial conversion price is approximately $84.02 per share. in the event that a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture under which the notes have been issued, occurs prior to maturity of the notes, the initial conversion rate may be increased to include additional shares upon conversion, or holders can require us to purchase from them all or a portion of their notes for 100% of the principal value plus any accrued and unpaid interest.
in connection with the initial offering of the notes, we entered into convertible note hedge (call option) and warrant transactions with multiple counterparties. the convertible note hedge covers, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of our common stock that initially underlie the notes, and are intended to reduce the potential dilutive impact of the conversion feature of the notes. the convertible note hedge will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the notes or the first day the notes are no longer outstanding. the warrants have an initial strike price of approximately $103.41 per share, and may be settled in cash or shares of our common stock, at our option. the warrants will become exercisable (and, if not exercised, will expire) at various dates during 2017.
during 2015, we settled conversion obligations for $166.5 million principal amount of notes previously surrendered for conversion. in accordance with the terms of the notes, we elected to settle these conversion obligations through a combination of cash, in an amount equal to the principal amount of the converted notes, and shares of our common stock in respect of any amounts due in excess thereof. as a result of the settlement of the notes, we exercised a proportionate amount of our convertible note hedges, for which we received shares of common stock, which was approximately equal to the number of shares we were required to issue to settle the non-cash portion of the related note conversions.
in november 2015, we entered into an amendment agreement with a warrant holder whereby the parties agreed to reduce a portion of the number of warrants held by the warrant holder by up to a maximum of 476,376. the reduction in the number of warrants was determined based on the number of warrants with respect to which the warrant holder closed out its hedge position, provided that the warrant holder did not effect any purchases at a price per share exceeding $535.00 per share, during the period starting on november 16, 2015 and ending no later than february 9, 2016. as a result of the warrant holder closing out a portion of its hedge position prior to december 31, 2015, we paid a total of $50.0 million in 2015 to reduce the number of warrants held by such warrant holder by 115,970. additionally, during january 2016, the warrant holder closed out additional portions of its hedge position, and, as a result, we paid $135.3 million to further reduce the number of warrants held by such warrant holder by 360,406 (which was the remaining maximum number of warrants to be reduced subject to the amendment agreement).
86
in addition to cash paid pursuant to the november 2015 agreement noted above, during 2015 we paid an aggregate amount of $523.5 million to warrant holders to reduce the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants. as of december 31, 2015, an aggregate of 2,109,098 warrants (subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in the applicable warrant agreements) remained outstanding.
funding requirements we expect continued increases in our expenditures, particularly in connection with our research and development activities (including preclinical and clinical testing), costs related to the preparation for potential commercialization of our late-stage antibody product candidates, and commercialization of eylea and praluent. we believe that our existing capital resources, borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility, funds generated by anticipated eylea net product sales, and, as described above under "collaboration agreements," funding for reimbursement of research and development costs that we are entitled to receive under our collaboration agreements with sanofi and bayer healthcare, will enable us to meet our projected operating needs for the foreseeable future.
in connection with our funding requirements, the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2015. these obligations and commitments assume non-termination of agreements and represent expected payments based on current operating forecasts, which are subject to change:
payments due by period
(in millions)                                      total             less than one year             1 to 3 years             3 to 5 years           greater than 5 years convertible senior notes (1)                   $11.4                     $11.4                          -                        -                            -
operating leases (2)                           112.8                      15.5                      $23.5                    $23.1                        $50.7

(1)   consists of $11.2 million remaining aggregate principal amount of 1.875% convertible senior notes that mature on october 1, 2016, unless earlier converted or repurchased. the amount in the table above assumes the payment of interest on our notes through their maturity date and the payment of the principal amount of the notes at their maturity date. interest on the notes is payable semi-annually. the notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our option. see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.
(2)   excludes future contingent costs for utilities, real estate taxes, and operating expenses. in 2015, these costs were $15.5 million. see note 12(a) to our consolidated financial statements.
(3)   purchase and other obligations primarily relate to research and development commitments, including those related to clinical trials, and capital expenditures for equipment acquisitions. our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may increase or be reduced based on certain future events. open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the table above.
(4)   represents rent payments with respect to facility lease obligations in connection with our lease of certain buildings in tarrytown, new york, as described under "tarrytown, new york leases" above. rent payments on two of these buildings commenced in the second half of 2015, and were based on several factors, including the landlord's costs of construction and tenant allowances. see note 12(a) to our consolidated financial statements.
liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, totaling $116.6 million at december 31, 2015, are not included in the table of contractual obligations above as, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the period of potential future cash settlement with taxing authorities. see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.
we enter into research collaboration and licensing agreements that may require us to pay amounts upon the achievement of various development and commercial milestones, which, in the aggregate, could be significant. additionally, if required by the agreement, we may be required to make royalty payments calculated based on a percentage of net product sales. for example, in may 2013, we acquired from sanofi full exclusive rights to antibodies targeting the pdgf family of receptors and ligands in ophthalmology and all other indications; consequently, we are obligated to pay up to $20.0 million in potential additional development milestones as well as royalties on any future sales of pdgf antibodies. the payment of these amounts, however, is contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring and for which the
87
specific timing cannot be predicted. because of these factors, such payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations above. see note 3 and note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.
under our antibody collaboration with sanofi and our collaboration with bayer healthcare for eylea outside the united states, we and our collaborator share profits and losses in connection with commercialization of drug products. profits or losses under each collaboration are measured by calculating net sales less cost of goods sold and shared commercialization and other expenses. if the applicable collaboration is profitable, we have contingent contractual obligations to reimburse sanofi and bayer healthcare for a defined percentage (generally 50%) of agreed-upon development expenses funded by sanofi and bayer healthcare. these reimbursements would be deducted each quarter, in accordance with a formula, from our share of the collaboration profits (and, for our eylea collaboration with bayer healthcare, our percentage on product sales in japan) otherwise payable to us, unless, in some cases, we elect to reimburse these expenses at a faster rate. in particular, as of december 31, 2015, our contingent reimbursement obligation to bayer healthcare for eylea was approximately $258 million and our contingent reimbursement obligation to sanofi in connection with the companies' antibody collaboration was approximately $1,832 million. therefore, we expect that, for the foreseeable future, a portion of our share of profits from sales of eylea outside the united states and a portion of our share of profits, if any, from sales of praluent and other antibody product candidates (if approved) developed as part of the antibody collaboration will be used to reimburse our collaborator for this obligation. as described above under item 1. "business - collaboration agreements - collaborations with sanofi", pursuant to the amended zaltrap agreement, regeneron no longer has a contingent contractual obligation (which was approximately $461 million at december 31, 2014) to reimburse sanofi for 50% of the development expenses that sanofi previously funded for the development of zaltrap under the zaltrap collaboration agreement.
the amount we need to fund operations will depend on various factors, including revenues from net product sales, the potential regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates and the timing thereof, the status of competitive products, the success of our research and development programs, the potential future need to expand our professional and support staff and facilities, the status of patents and other intellectual property rights (and future litigation related thereto), the delay or failure of a clinical trial of any of our potential drug candidates, and the continuation, extent, and success of our collaborations (in particular those with sanofi and bayer healthcare). clinical trial costs are dependent, among other things, on the size and duration of trials, fees charged for services provided by clinical trial investigators and other third parties, the costs for manufacturing the product candidate for use in the trials, and for supplies, laboratory tests, and other expenses. the amount of funding that will be required for our clinical programs depends upon the results of our research and preclinical programs and early-stage clinical trials, regulatory requirements, the duration and results of clinical trials underway and of additional clinical trials that we decide to initiate, and the various factors that affect the cost of each trial as described above.
in addition to our anticipated commercialization costs for eylea and praluent, we anticipate incurring substantial commercialization costs in connection with our late-stage antibody product candidates. commercialization costs over the next few years will depend on, among other things, whether or not our antibody product candidates in later stage clinical development receive regulatory approval, the market potential for product candidates, and the commercialization terms of our collaboration agreements, if applicable (whereby some or all commercialization costs may be shared with our collaborators). currently, we are required to pay royalties on sales of certain commercial products. in the future, if we are able to successfully develop, market, and sell certain of our product candidates, we may be required to pay additional royalties or share the profits from such sales pursuant to our license or collaboration agreements. in addition, under the provisions of the ppaca and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010, the branded prescription drug fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs. this fee is allocated to companies, including regeneron, based on their market share of total branded prescription drug sales into these government programs.
as described above, in 2015, 2014, and 2013, we made cash payments of $160.5 million, $267.6 million, and $195.1 million, respectively, for employee tax obligations in connection with stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock. future cash requirements for such payments will depend on various factors, including the level of stock option grants and exercises and the sales prices of our common stock, and may continue to be substantial.
we expect that expenses related to the filing, prosecution, defense, and enforcement of patents and other intellectual property will be substantial.
as described under "convertible senior notes" above, in november 2015, we entered into an agreement with a warrant holder whereby the parties agreed to reduce the number of warrants held by the warrant holder. under the terms of the agreement, during 2015 and january 2016, we paid a total of $50.0 million and $135.3 million, respectively, to reduce the number of warrants held by the warrant holder. from time to time, we may seek to further reduce the number of warrants outstanding through additional amendment agreements with warrant holders or otherwise.
due primarily to potential excess tax benefits in connection with stock option exercises, we expect our cash income tax payments for 2016 to be significantly less than the income tax expense recorded in our financial statements in 2016, which is based on an
88
effective tax rate. however, we expect our cash income tax payments in 2016 to be substantially higher than such payments in 2015.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
future impact of recently issued accounting standards in november 2015, the fasb issued accounting standards update 2015-17, balance sheet classification of deferred taxes, which is intended to simplify the balance sheet presentation of deferred income taxes. current accounting principles require an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in its balance sheet. the amendments require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in its balance sheet. the amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2016. companies may apply the new provisions either retrospectively or on a prospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. we early adopted the amendments effective december 31, 2015 on a retrospective basis. the impact of the adoption of the amendments on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2014 was a $46.2 million reclassification of current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax assets.
in may 2014, the fasb issued accounting standards update 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers, which will replace existing revenue recognition guidance. the new standard requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. to achieve that core principle, an entity must identify the contract(s) with a customer, identify the performance obligations in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies the performance obligation. in july 2015, the fasb decided to delay the effective date of the new standard by one year; as a result, the new standard will be effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption will be permitted, but no earlier than 2017 for calendar year-end entities. the standard allows for two transition methods - retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial adoption. we have not yet determined our method of transition and are evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our financial statements.
in january 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update 2016-01, recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. the amendments require equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, and separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset. additionally, the amendments eliminate the requirement to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments. the amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2017. other than an amendment relating to presenting in comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in instrument-specific credit risk (if the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value), early adoption is not permitted. we are evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our financial statements.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
introduction and overview the following management's discussion and analysis ("md&a"), should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements ("financial statements") in item 8 and the forward-looking statements and the risk factors set forth in item 1a.
yum! brands, inc. ("yum" or the "company") operates, franchises or licenses a worldwide system of over 42,000 restaurants in more than 130 countries and territories operating primarily under the kfc, pizza hut or taco bell (collectively the "concepts") brands. these three concepts are the global leaders in the chicken, pizza and mexican-style food categories, respectively.  of the over 42,000 restaurants, 21% are operated by the company and its subsidiaries and 79% are operated by franchisees, licensees or unconsolidated affiliates.
as of december 26, 2015, yum consists of five operating segments:
•   yum china ("china" or "china division") which includes all operations in mainland china
•   yum india ("india" or "india division") which includes all operations in india, bangladesh, nepal and sri lanka
•   the kfc division which includes all operations of the kfc concept outside of china division and india division
•   the pizza hut division which includes all operations of the pizza hut concept outside of china division and india division
•   the taco bell division which includes all operations of the taco bell concept outside of india division effective january, 2016 the india division was segmented by brand, integrated into the global kfc, pizza hut and taco bell divisions, and is no longer a separate operating segment. while our consolidated results will not be impacted, we will restate our historical segment information during 2016 for consistent presentation.
in october, 2015 we announced our intent to separate yum's china business from yum into an independent, publicly-traded company by the end of 2016. this transaction, which is expected to be a tax-free spin-off of our china business, will create two powerful, independent, focused growth companies with distinct strategies, financial profiles and investment characteristics. the new china entity will become a licensee of yum in mainland china, with exclusive rights to the kfc, pizza hut and taco bell concepts. upon completion of the planned spin-off, yum will become more of a "pure play" franchisor with more stable earnings, higher profit margins, lower capital requirements and stronger cash flow conversion. consistent with this strategy yum is targeting 96% franchisee ownership of its restaurants by the end of 2017.
yum has announced its intention to return substantial capital to shareholders prior to this planned spin-off, the majority of which will be funded by incremental borrowings. with this recapitalization, the company is transitioning to a non-investment grade credit rating with a balance sheet more consistent with highly-levered peer restaurant franchise companies. moreover, this will allow for an ongoing return-of-capital framework that will seek to optimize the company's long-term growth rate on a per-share basis.
completion of the spin-off will be subject to certain conditions, including receiving final approval from the yum board of directors, receipt of various regulatory approvals, receipt of an opinion of counsel with respect to certain tax matters, the effectiveness of filings related to public listing and applicable securities laws, and other terms and conditions as may be determined by the board of directors. there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the proposed transaction or that the transaction will be completed.
our historical ongoing earnings growth model has targeted a 10% earnings per share ("eps") growth rate, which was based on operating profit growth targets of 15% in china, 10% for our kfc division, 8% for our pizza hut division, and 6% for our taco bell division. see the division discussions within the results of operations section of this md&a for further details on our divisions' 2015 targets.
yum's 2016 operating profit is expected to grow 10% in constant currency, including the impact of 2016 having a 53rd week. while we expect to spin off our china business prior to the end of 2016, this target assumes our china business will remain part of yum through the end of 2016. yum's 2016 target is based on operating profit growth instead of eps growth given the uncertainties surrounding the specific timing and pricing of our 2016 shareholder capital returns.
subsequent to the spin-off of our china business, we are targeting about 15% ongoing eps growth for the new china entity and about 15% ongoing total shareholder return for the remaining ongoing yum business. the new china entity's 15% eps growth includes contributions from both operating profit and financial strategies such as share repurchases. yum's 15% total shareholder return includes ongoing operating profit growth targets of 10% for our kfc division, 8% for our pizza hut division and 6% for
24
our taco bell division, which are consistent with our historical ongoing earnings growth model. the 15% total shareholder return also includes 1% to 2% growth from the china license fee, 3% to 5% growth from financial strategies and approximately 2% yield from dividends.
we intend for this md&a to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our results of operations, including performance metrics that management uses to assess the company's performance. throughout this md&a, we commonly discuss the following performance metrics:
•   the company provides certain percentage changes excluding the impact of foreign currency translation ("fx" or "forex"). these amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. we believe the elimination of the foreign currency translation impact provides better year-to-year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations.
•   system sales growth includes the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including company-owned, franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants that operate our concepts, except for non-company-owned restaurants for which we do not receive a sales-based royalty. sales of franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants typically generate ongoing franchise and license fees for the company at a rate of 4% to 6% of sales. franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurant sales are not included in company sales on the consolidated statements of income; however, the franchise and license fees are included in the company's revenues. we believe system sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates all of our revenue drivers, company and franchise same-store sales as well as net unit growth.
•   same-store sales growth is the estimated percentage change in sales of all restaurants that have been open and in the yum system one year or more.
•   company restaurant profit ("restaurant profit") is defined as company sales less expenses incurred directly by our company-owned restaurants in generating company sales. company restaurant margin as a percentage of sales is defined as restaurant profit divided by company sales. within the company sales and restaurant profit analysis, store portfolio actions represent the net impact of new unit openings, acquisitions, refranchising and store closures, and other primarily represents the impact of same-store sales as well as the impact of changes in costs such as inflation/deflation.
•   in addition to the results provided in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") throughout this md&amp;a, the company provides non-gaap measurements which present operating results on a basis before special items. the company uses earnings before special items as a key performance measure of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally and special items are not included in any of our segment results. this non-gaap measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with gaap. rather, the company believes that the presentation of earnings before special items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present results, excluding those items that the company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and/or nature.
all note references herein refer to the notes to the financial statements.  tabular amounts are displayed in millions of u.s. dollars except per share and unit count amounts, or as otherwise specifically identified. percentages may not recompute due to rounding.
results of operations summary all comparisons within this summary are versus the same period a year ago and exclude the impact of special items.  all system sales growth and operating profit comparisons exclude the impact of foreign currency.
2015 diluted eps increased 3% to $3.18 per share versus our target of 10% growth, as sales and profits at our china division did not recover as strongly as expected and adverse foreign currency translation significantly impacted reported earnings.
we expected china division sales and profits to grow significantly in the second half of 2015 as we recovered from the adverse publicity in july 2014 surrounding improper food handling practices of a former supplier. china division sales initially turned significantly positive as we lapped the july 2014 supplier incident, but overall sales in the second half of 2015 trailed our expectations, particularly at pizza hut casual dining. kfc china grew same stores sales 3% in q3 and 6% in q4, while pizza hut casual dining same-store sales declined 1% in q3 and 8% in q4. for the year china division same-store sales declined 4%.
25
foreign currency translation from our international operations negatively impacted eps growth by 6 percentage points.

(a)   effective the beginning of 2014, results from our mauritius stores are included in kfc and pizza hut divisions as applicable. prior year units have been adjusted for comparability while division system sales growth, total revenues and operating profit (loss) have not been restated due to the immaterial dollar impact of this change. while there was no impact to our consolidated results, this change negatively impacted india's 2014 system sales growth, reported and excluding fx, by 10% and 11%, respectively. this change negatively impacted india's 2014 total revenues by 2% and operating profit (loss) by $1 million.

consolidated cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was $2,139 million in 2015 versus $2,049 million in 2014. the increase was primarily driven by lapping higher income tax payments in the prior year, partially offset by higher pension contributions.
in 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $2,049 million compared to $2,139 million in 2013. the decrease was primarily driven by higher income taxes paid.
net cash used in investing activities was $682 million in 2015 compared to $936 million in 2014. the decrease was primarily driven by higher refranchising proceeds and lower capital spending.
in 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $936 million compared to $886 million in 2013. the increase was primarily driven by lower refranchising proceeds, partially offset by lapping the acquisition of restaurants in turkey from an existing franchisee in april 2013.
net cash used in financing activities was $1,292 million in 2015 compared to $1,114 million in 2014. the increase was primarily driven by higher share repurchases and dividends, partially offset by higher net borrowings.
in 2014, net cash used in financing activities was $1,114 million compared to $1,451 million in 2013. the decrease was primarily driven by higher borrowings on our revolving credit facility.
consolidated financial condition the increase in our short-term borrowings is primarily due to the outstanding balance of $600 million on a new term loan facility and the reclassification of $300 million senior unsecured notes as short-term due to their april 2016 maturity date, partially offset by the maturity of $250 million senior unsecured notes in september 2015.
long-term debt is also impacted by outstanding borrowings of $701 million under our revolving credit facility as of december 26, 2015. see note 10.
other liabilities and deferred credits declined $277 million primarily due to actuarial gains and cash contributions related to our pension plans.
liquidity and capital resources operating in the retail food industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company-owned stores and from our extensive franchise operations which require a limited yum investment. net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded $2 billion each of the last five fiscal years. these operating cash flows have largely funded our historical capital spending and returns to shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases.
to the extent operating cash flows plus other sources of cash such as refranchising proceeds have not covered our desired levels of capital spending and returns to shareholders, we have had borrowing capacity to fund shortfalls. net cash provided by operating activities, refranchising proceeds, capital spending, repurchases of shares of common stock and dividends paid on common stock each of the last three years are as follows:
2015                2014                2013

we generate a significant amount of cash from operating activities outside the u.s. that we have used historically to fund our international development. to the extent we have needed to repatriate international cash to fund our u.s. discretionary cash spending, including returns to shareholders and debt repayments, we have historically been able to do so in a tax-efficient manner.
41
if we experience an unforeseen decrease in our cash flows from our u.s. businesses or are unable to refinance future u.s. debt maturities we may be required to repatriate future international earnings at tax rates higher than we have historically experienced.
as previously noted we intend to spin-off our china business from yum into an independent, publicly-traded company prior to the end of 2016. upon completion of the planned spin-off, yum will become more of a "pure play" franchisor with more stable earnings, higher profit margins, lower capital requirements and stronger cash flow conversion.
yum has announced its intention to return approximately $6.2 billion of capital to shareholders prior to this planned spin-off, the majority of which would be funded by incremental borrowings. we expect these incremental borrowings to occur as the company transitions to a non-investment grade credit rating with a balance sheet more consistent with highly-levered peer restaurant franchise companies.
as part of our intention to return up to $6.2 billion to shareholders, we began increasing our rate of share repurchases in october, 2015. in december, 2015 we entered into a $1.5 billion short-term credit facility to help fund these share repurchases, and there were $600 million of outstanding borrowings related to this facility as of december 26, 2015. we expect to borrow an additional $5.2 billion in 2016.
when we announced our recapitalization plan, our credit ratings were lowered to non-investment grade by both standard & poor's (bb) and moody's investor services (ba3). this downgrade did not significantly impact our 2015 borrowing costs and we do not expect it to impact our ability to execute our recapitalization plan or the balance of our planned shareholder returns. while we do not anticipate any further downgrade to our credit rating, such a downgrade would increase the company's current borrowing costs and could impact the company's ability to access the credit markets cost effectively if necessary. based on the amount and composition of our debt at december 26, 2015, our interest expense would not materially increase on a full-year basis should we receive a further one-level downgrade in our ratings.
borrowing capacity our primary bank credit agreement comprises a $1.3 billion syndicated senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "credit facility") which matures in march 2017 and includes 24 participating banks with commitments ranging from $23 million to $115 million. we believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank.
under the terms of the credit facility, we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit, less outstanding letters of credit or banker's acceptances, where applicable. at december 26, 2015, our unused credit facility totaled $594 million net of outstanding letters of credit of $5 million and outstanding borrowings of $701 million. the interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility ranges from 1.00% to 1.75% over the "london interbank offered rate" ("libor"). the exact spread over libor under the credit facility depends upon our performance against specified financial criteria. interest on any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility is payable at least quarterly.
on december 8, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement providing for an unsecured term loan facility (the "short-term loan credit facility") in an amount up to $1.5 billion which matures in june 2016 with an option for yum to extend maturity for an additional three months and includes three participating banks. this credit agreement is being used to fund a portion of our planned capital returns to shareholders.
under the terms of the short-term loan credit facility, we may borrow up to the full amount of the facility in up to three draws. at december 26, 2015, our unused short-term loan credit facility totaled $900 million net of outstanding borrowings of $600 million. the interest rate for most borrowings under the short-term loan credit facility ranges from 1.00% to 1.75% over libor. the exact spread over libor under the short-term loan credit facility depends upon our performance against specified financial criteria. interest on any outstanding borrowings under the short-term loan credit facility is payable at least quarterly.
both the credit facility and the short-term loan credit facility are unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries and contain financial covenants relating to the maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. the agreements for both credit facilities also contain affirmative and negative covenants including, among other things, limitations on certain additional indebtedness and liens, and certain other transactions specified in the agreement. given the company's strong balance sheet and cash flows we were able to comply with all debt covenant requirements at december 26, 2015 with a considerable amount of cushion. additionally, both facilities contain cross-default provisions whereby our failure to make any payment on our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of $125 million, or the acceleration of the maturity of any such indebtedness, will constitute a default under such agreement.
42
the majority of our remaining long-term debt primarily comprises senior unsecured notes with varying maturity dates from 2016 through 2043 and stated interest rates ranging from 3.75% to 6.88%. the notes represent senior, unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness. amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes were $2.5 billion at december 26, 2015. our senior unsecured notes contain cross-default provisions whereby the acceleration of the maturity of any of our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of $50 million will constitute a default under the senior unsecured notes unless such indebtedness is discharged, or the acceleration of the maturity of that indebtedness is annulled, within 30 days after notice.
contractual obligations our significant contractual obligations and payments as of december 26, 2015 included:
total            less than 1 year             1-3 years             3-5 years           more than 5 years long-term debt obligations(a)          $5,072                  $1,048                  $1,233                  $759                    $2,032
capital leases(b)                         287                      20                      40                    39                       188
operating leases(b)                     4,957                     672                   1,189                   973                     2,123
purchase obligations(c)                   765                     568                     136                    54                         7
benefit plans(d)                          259                      61                     100                    32                        66
total contractual obligations         $11,340                  $2,369                  $2,698                $1,857                    $4,416
(a)   amounts include maturities of debt outstanding as of december 26, 2015 and expected interest payments on those outstanding amounts on a nominal basis. see note 10.
(b)   these obligations, which are shown on a nominal basis, relate primarily to approximately 8,000 company-owned restaurants. see note 11.
(c)   purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. we have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty. purchase obligations relate primarily to supply agreements, marketing, information technology, purchases of property, plant and equipment ("pp&amp;e") as well as consulting, maintenance and other agreements.
(d)   includes actuarially-determined timing of payments from our most significant unfunded pension plan as well as scheduled payments from our deferred compensation plan and other unfunded benefit plans where payment dates are determinable. this table excludes $34 million of future benefit payments for deferred compensation and other unfunded benefit plans to be paid upon separation of employee's service or retirement from the company, as we cannot reasonably estimate the dates of these future cash payments.
we sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain salaried and hourly employees, the most significant of which are in the u.s. and uk.  the most significant of the u.s. plans, the yum retirement plan (the "plan"), is funded while benefits from our other significant u.s. plan are paid by the company as incurred (see footnote (d) above).  our funding policy for the plan is to contribute annually amounts that will at least equal the minimum amounts required to comply with the pension protection act of 2006.  however, additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time to improve the plan's funded status.  at december 26, 2015 the plan was in a net underfunded position of $29 million.  the uk pension plans were in a net overfunded position of $58 million at our 2015 measurement date.
we do not anticipate making any significant contributions to the plan in 2016. investment performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our net funding position as they drive our asset balances and discount rate assumptions.  future changes in investment performance and corporate bond rates could impact our funded status and the timing and amounts of required contributions in 2016 and beyond.
our post-retirement health care plan in the u.s. is not required to be funded in advance, but is pay as you go.  we made post-retirement benefit payments of $6 million in 2015 and no future funding amounts are included in the contractual obligations table.  see note 13.
43
we have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are self-insured, including workers' compensation, employment practices liability, general liability, automobile liability, product liability and property losses (collectively "property and casualty losses") and employee healthcare and long-term disability claims.  the majority of our recorded liability for self-insured property and casualty losses and employee healthcare and long-term disability claims represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled.
we have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately $28 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits relating to various tax positions we have taken.  these liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations, and given the status of the examinations, we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities.  these liabilities exclude amounts that are temporary in nature and for which we anticipate that over time there will be no net cash outflow.
we have excluded from the contractual obligations table certain commitments associated with the kfc u.s. acceleration agreement (see note 4) as we cannot reliably estimate the specific timing of the remaining investments to be made in each of the next two years. in connection with this agreement we anticipate investing a total of approximately $125 million through 2017 primarily to fund new back-of-house equipment for franchisees and to provide incentives to accelerate franchisee store remodels, of which $72 million was invested in 2015.
off-balance sheet arrangements see the lease guarantees, franchise loan pool and equipment guarantees, and unconsolidated affiliates guarantees sections of note 18 for discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements.
new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in may, 2014 the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) (asu 2014-09), to provide principles within a single framework for revenue recognition of transactions involving contracts with customers across all industries. in july, 2015 the fasb approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of the new standard. asu 2014-09 is now effective for the company in our first quarter of fiscal year 2018 with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of 2017. the standard allows for either a full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. the standard will not impact our recognition of revenue from company-owned restaurants or our recognition of continuing fees from franchisees or licensees, which are based on a percentage of franchise and license sales. we are continuing to evaluate the impact the adoption of this standard will have on the recognition of other less significant revenue transactions such as initial fees from franchisees and refranchising of company-owned restaurants.
critical accounting policies and estimates our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments.  these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition.  changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future years.  a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows.
impairment or disposal of long-lived assets we review long-lived assets of restaurants (primarily pp&e and allocated intangible assets subject to amortization) semi-annually for impairment, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable.  we evaluate recoverability based on the restaurant's forecasted undiscounted cash flows, which incorporate our best estimate of sales growth and margin improvement based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants.  for restaurant assets that are deemed to not be recoverable, we write down the impaired restaurant to its estimated fair value.  key assumptions in the determination of fair value are the future after-tax cash flows of the restaurant, which are reduced by future royalties a franchisee would pay, and a discount rate.  the after-tax cash flows incorporate reasonable sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that would be used by a franchisee in the determination of a purchase price for the restaurant.  estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions.
we perform an impairment evaluation at a restaurant group level if it is more likely than not that we will refranchise restaurants as a group.  expected net sales proceeds are generally based on actual bids from the buyer, if available, or anticipated bids given
44
the discounted projected after-tax cash flows for the group of restaurants.  historically, these anticipated bids have been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received. the after-tax cash flows used in determining the anticipated bids incorporate reasonable assumptions we believe a franchisee would make such as sales growth and margin improvement as well as expectations as to the useful lives of the restaurant assets. these after-tax cash flows also include a deduction for the anticipated, future royalties we would receive under a franchise agreement with terms substantially at market entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction.
the discount rate used in the fair value calculations is our estimate of the required rate of return that a franchisee would expect to receive when purchasing a similar restaurant or groups of restaurants and the related long-lived assets.  the discount rate incorporates rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows.
we evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist. we perform our annual test for impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets at the beginning of our fourth quarter. fair value is an estimate of the price a willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset and is generally estimated by discounting the expected future after-tax cash flows associated with the intangible asset.  our most significant indefinite-lived intangible asset is our little sheep trademark with a book value of $56 million at december 26, 2015. the fair value estimate of the little sheep trademark in our fourth quarter impairment testing exceeded its carrying value. fair value was determined using a relief-from-royalty valuation approach that included estimated future revenues as a significant input, and a discount rate of 13% as our estimate of the required rate-of-return that a third-party buyer would expect to receive when purchasing the little sheep trademark. the primary drivers of fair value include franchise revenue growth and revenues from a wholly-owned business that sells seasoning to retail customers. franchise revenue growth reflects annual same-store sales growth of 4% and approximately 35 new franchise units per year, partially offset by the impact of approximately 25 franchise closures per year. the seasoning business is forecasted to generate sales growth rates consistent with historical results.
impairment of goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist.  goodwill is evaluated for impairment by determining whether the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying values. our reporting units are our business units (which are aligned based on geography) in our kfc, pizza hut and taco bell divisions and individual brands in our china and india divisions.  fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit, and is generally estimated using discounted expected future after-tax cash flows from company-owned restaurant operations and franchise royalties.
future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit.  future cash flows are based on growth expectations relative to recent historical performance and incorporate sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that we believe a third-party buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit.  the sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that factor into the discounted cash flows are highly correlated as cash flow growth can be achieved through various interrelated strategies such as product pricing and restaurant productivity initiatives. the discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a third-party buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit. we believe the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows.
the fair values of all our reporting units with goodwill balances were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of the 2015 goodwill testing date.
when we refranchise restaurants, we include goodwill in the carrying amount of the restaurants disposed of based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in the refranchising versus the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained.  the fair value of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in a refranchising is determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee, which include a deduction for the anticipated, future royalties the franchisee will pay us associated with the franchise agreement entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction. appropriate adjustments are made to the fair value determinations if such franchise agreement is determined to not be at prevailing market rates.  when determining whether such franchise agreement is at prevailing market rates our primary consideration is consistency with the terms of our current franchise agreements both within the country that the restaurants are being refranchised in and around the world.  the company believes consistency in royalty rates as a percentage of sales is appropriate as the company and franchisee share in the impact of near-term fluctuations in sales results with the acknowledgment that over the long-term the royalty rate represents an appropriate rate for both parties.
45
the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee is reduced by future royalties the franchisee will pay the company.  the company thus considers the fair value of future royalties to be received under the franchise agreement as fair value retained in its determination of the goodwill to be written off when refranchising.  others may consider the fair value of these future royalties as fair value disposed of and thus would conclude that a larger percentage of a reporting unit's fair value is disposed of in a refranchising transaction.
during 2015, the company's reporting units with the most significant refranchising activity and recorded goodwill were kfc india, taco bell u.s. and kfc china.  within kfc india, 86 restaurants were refranchised (representing 42% of beginning-of-year company units) and less than $1 million in goodwill was written off (representing 25% of beginning-of-year goodwill). within taco bell u.s., 65 restaurants were refranchised (representing 7% of beginning-of-year company units) and $2 million in goodwill was written off (representing 2% of beginning-of-year goodwill). within kfc china, 52 restaurants were refranchised (representing 1% of beginning-of-year company units) and less than $1 million in goodwill was written off (representing less than 1% of beginning-of-year goodwill).
see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill.
self-insured property and casualty losses we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred self-insured property and casualty losses.  the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment, benefit levels, medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall self-insurance costs.  additionally, our reserve includes a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years required to settle claims, increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate.
see note 18 for a further discussion of our insurance programs.
pension plans certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans. our two most significant plans are in the u.s. and combined had a projected benefit obligation ("pbo") of $1,134 million and a fair value of plan assets of $1,004 million at december 26, 2015.
the pbo reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels.  due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid, our pbos are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates.  for our u.s. plans, we measured our pbos using a discount rate of 4.90% at december 26, 2015.  this discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary.  the primary basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated aa or higher by moody's or s&p with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans.  we exclude from the model those corporate debt instruments flagged by moody's or s&p for a potential downgrade (if the potential downgrade would result in a rating below aa by both moody's and s&p) and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean.  in considering possible bond portfolios, the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit payment cash flows for that year.  such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate one-year forward rates and used to meet the benefit payment cash flows in a future year.  the weighted-average yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate.  we also ensure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary. a 50 basis-point increase in this discount rate would have decreased these u.s. plans' pbos by approximately $70 million at our measurement date.  conversely, a 50 basis-point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our u.s. plans' pbos by approximately $80 million at our measurement date.
the pension expense we will record in 2016 is also impacted by the discount rate, as well as the long-term rates of return on plan assets and mortality assumptions we selected at our measurement date.  we expect pension expense for our u.s. plans to decrease approximately $35 million in 2016.  the decrease is primarily driven by a decrease in amortization of net loss due to lower net unrecognized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income.  lower net unrecognized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are primarily a result of a higher discount rate at our 2015 measurement date. a 50 basis-point change in our discount rate assumption at our measurement date would impact our 2016 u.s. pension expense by approximately $6 million.
our estimated long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets is based upon the weighted-average of historical returns for each asset category.  our expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets, for purposes of determining 2016 pension expense, at december 26, 2015 was 6.75%.  we believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market
46
returns thereon.  a 100 basis point change in our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption would impact our 2016 u.s. pension expense by approximately $10 million. additionally, every 100 basis point variation in actual return on plan assets versus our expected return of 6.75% will impact our unrecognized pre-tax actuarial net loss by approximately $10 million.
a decrease in discount rates over time has largely contributed to an unrecognized pre-tax actuarial net loss of $138 million included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for these u.s. plans at december 26, 2015.  we will recognize approximately $6 million of such loss in net periodic benefit cost in 2016 versus $45 million recognized in 2015. see note 13.
income taxes at december 26, 2015, we had valuation allowances of approximately $250 million to reduce our $1.2 billion of deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.  the net deferred tax assets primarily relate to temporary differences in profitable u.s. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions, net operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions, the majority of which do not expire, and u.s. foreign tax credit carryovers that expire 10 years from inception and for which we anticipate having foreign earnings to utilize. in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider future taxable income in the various jurisdictions as well as carryforward periods and restrictions on usage. the estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize deferred tax assets can significantly change based on future events, including our determinations as to feasibility of certain tax planning strategies. thus, recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes.
as a matter of course, we are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.  we recognize the benefit of positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in our income tax provision when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by these tax authorities.  a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement.  at december 26, 2015 we had $98 million of unrecognized tax benefits, $89 million of which are temporary in nature and, if recognized, would not impact the effective tax rate.  we evaluate unrecognized tax benefits, including interest thereon, on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events, including audit settlements, which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures.
we have investments in foreign subsidiaries where the carrying values for financial reporting exceed the tax basis.  we have not provided deferred tax on the portion of the excess that we believe is indefinitely reinvested, as we have the ability and intent to indefinitely postpone these basis differences from reversing with a tax consequence.   we estimate that our total temporary difference upon which we have not provided deferred tax is approximately $2.3 billion at december 26, 2015.  a determination of the deferred tax liability on this amount is not practicable.
if our intentions regarding our ability and intent to postpone these basis differences from reversing with a tax consequence change, deferred tax may need to be provided that could materially impact the provision for income taxes.
see note 16 for a further discussion of our income taxes.

during the year ended december 31, 2021, revenues increased by $1,855 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020, representing growth of 11.1%, or 10.0% on a constant currency basis1. our recently completed acquisitions contributed 320 basis points to our revenue growth. revenue growth also reflected our clients' continued adoption and integration of digital technologies and was aided by the negative impact on 2020 revenues of the covid-19 pandemic. revenue growth in the healthcare segment was driven by increased demand for our services from our pharmaceutical clients while continued adoption and integration of digital technologies across our manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities clients drove revenue growth in the products and resources segment. revenues in the communications, media and technology segment benefited from our technology clients' growing demand for services related to digital content. our 2020 revenue was negatively affected by the samlink impact, which contributed approximately 70 basis points to our 2021 revenue growth. we continue to experience pricing pressure on our non-digital services as our clients, particularly those in the financial services segment, optimize the cost of supporting their legacy systems and operations.
our operating margin and adjusted operating margin1 increased to 15.3% and 15.4%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2021 from 12.7% and 14.4%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2020. our 2021 gaap and adjusted operating margins benefited from savings generated by the implementation of the delivery cost optimization initiatives of our 2020 fit for growth plan and a decrease in travel and entertainment costs. these benefits were partially offset by investments intended to drive and support organic revenue growth, including additions to our sales organization and initiatives to reposition our brand, as well as the negative impact on margin of our recently completed acquisitions, increased subcontractor and compensation costs as a result of significantly elevated attrition and costs related to the modernization of our

cognizant         22       december 31, 2021 form 10-k core it systems. our 2020 operating margins were adversely impacted by the decline in revenues brought on by the covid-19 pandemic, the samlink impact and the april 2020 ransomware attack. our 2020 gaap operating margin was also negatively impacted by costs related to our restructuring program that concluded at the end of 2020 and covid-19 charges.
during the fourth quarter of 2021, we reached a settlement agreement with the final customer involved in our previously disclosed proposed exit from a large customer engagement of our samlink subsidiary and additionally entered into an agreement to sell this subsidiary. we reached settlement agreements with the other two customers to this engagement in the second quarter of 2021. the financial terms of the final settlement agreements with the three customers did not materially differ from our original 2020 offer and, accordingly, the impact to our 2021 consolidated statement of operations was immaterial. in 2020, in connection with our settlement offer, we recorded a reduction of revenues of $118 million and additional expenses of $33 million, or, jointly, the samlink impact. this negatively impacted both our 2020 gaap and adjusted diluted eps2 by $0.27. the sale of our samlink subsidiary closed on february 1, 2022. in 2021, our samlink subsidiary had $113 million in revenues.
in the third quarter of 2021, the parties to the consolidated putative securities class action suit filed a settlement agreement that resolved the consolidated putative securities class action against us and certain of our former officers. as a result, we recorded a $20 million class action settlement loss in "selling, general and administrative expenses" in our consolidated financial statements. the loss is excluded from adjusted operating margin2 and adjusted diluted eps2. for further information see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements.
business outlook as we seek to increase our commercial momentum and accelerate growth, our four strategic priorities are:
•accelerating digital - growing our digital business organically and inorganically;
•globalizing cognizant - accelerating the growth of our business in key international markets and diversifying our leadership, capabilities and delivery footprint;
•repositioning our brand - improving our global brand recognition and becoming better known as a global digital partner to the entire c-suite; and
•increasing our relevance to our clients - leading with thought leadership and capabilities to address clients' business needs.
we continue to expect the long-term focus of our clients to be on their digital transformation into software-driven, data-enabled, customer-centric and differentiated businesses. the covid-19 pandemic accelerated our clients' need to modernize their business, which has led to increased demand for digital capabilities. in 2021, we completed seven acquisitions intended to expand our talent, experience and capabilities in key digital areas or in particular geographies or industries.
as our clients seek to optimize the cost of supporting their legacy systems and operations, our non-digital services have been and may continue to be subject to pricing pressure. in addition, our clients will likely continue to contend with industry-specific changes driven by evolving digital technologies, uncertainty in the regulatory environment, industry consolidation and convergence as well as international trade policies and other macroeconomic factors, which could affect their demand for our services.
as a global professional services company, we compete on the basis of the knowledge, experience, insights, skills and talent of our employees and the value they can provide to our clients. our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of skilled employees, in particular those with experience in key digital areas, in balance with client demand. competition for skilled employees in the current labor market is intense, and we experienced significantly elevated voluntary attrition during 2021. for the three months ended december 31, 2021, our annualized attrition rate, including both voluntary and involuntary, was 34.6% as compared to 19.0% for the three months ended december 31, 2020. for the year ended december 31, 2021, our attrition rate, including both voluntary and involuntary, was 30.8% as compared to 20.6% for the year ended december 31, 2020. challenges attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel have negatively impacted our ability to satisfy client demand and achieve our full revenue potential. we expect this impact to continue in 2022. further, our ongoing and anticipated future efforts with respect to recruitment, talent management and employee engagement may not be successful and may result in increased delivery costs during 2022. our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our employees. in certain regions, competition for employees with the advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. while we strive to adjust pricing to reduce the

our future results may be affected by potential tax law changes and other potential regulatory changes, including possible u.s. corporate income tax reform and potentially increased costs for employment and post-employment benefits in india as a result of the code on social security, 2020. for additional information, see part i, item 1a. risk factors.
environmental, social and corporate governance we believe environmental and social considerations are increasingly important to our clients and the talent we seek to attract and retain. as a company committed to improving everyday life, esg is an important part of our business and that of our clients. cognizant's vision is to become the preeminent technology services provider to the leaders of the world's global 2000 companies. our esg program is designed to support that vision and aligns with our clients' increasing focus on esg. in 2021, we took the following steps to advance our esg agenda:
•in february 2021, we announced an initiative to advance economic mobility, educational opportunity, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and health and well‐being in communities around the world through new philanthropic funding and in-kind contributions;
•in april 2021, as the second wave of the covid-19 pandemic gripped india, we launched operation c3. this initiative facilitated vaccination for our indian employees and their dependents, and set up vaccination drives across the country to help senior citizens, physically challenged dependents, and mothers with infants. operation c3 also provided critical medical equipment to hospitals, helped to boost oxygen supplies and more;
•in june 2021, we issued our first esg report with assured greenhouse gas emissions data;
•in october 2021, we announced our commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2030. this pledge calls for reducing emissions by 50% from the company's global operations and supply chain by 2030, and by 90% by 2040; and
•in october 2021, we launched "all belong," an initiative led by our executive committee and global d&i team designed to strengthen employee engagement, showcase our affinity groups, and recognize employees who exemplify inclusion.

¡ % of revenues our cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries, incentive-based compensation, stock-based compensation expense, employee benefits, project-related immigration and travel for technical personnel, subcontracting and equipment costs relating to revenues. the decrease in cost of revenues, as a percentage of revenues, was due primarily to savings from the implementation of the delivery cost optimization initiatives of our 2020 fit for growth plan, the adverse samlink impact in 2020, a decrease in travel and entertainment costs as a result of a reduction in travel due to the covid-19 pandemic as well as the negative impact on our 2020 results from the pandemic and the april 2020 ransomware attack, partially offset by increased subcontractor and compensation costs as a result of significantly elevated employee attrition levels.

sg&a expenses consist primarily of salaries, incentive-based compensation, stock-based compensation expense, employee benefits, immigration, travel, marketing, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. the increase, as a percentage of revenues, was due primarily to investments intended to drive and support organic revenue growth, including additions to our sales organization and initiatives to reposition our brand, as well as increased costs as a result of our recently completed acquisitions and costs related to the modernization of our core it systems, partially offset by a reduction in expenses attributable to the covid-19 pandemic and the april 2020 ransomware attack.

the foreign currency exchange gains and losses were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of the indian rupee denominated net monetary assets and liabilities in our u.s. dollar functional currency india subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, the remeasurement of other net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries. the gains and losses on our foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments related to the realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts entered into to offset foreign currency exposure to non-u.s. dollar denominated net monetary assets and liabilities. as of december 31, 2021, the notional value of our undesignated hedges was $847 million. the decrease in interest income of $89 million was primarily attributable to lower invested balances in india, which generate higher yields. our invested balances in india are lower in 2021 as a result of our repatriation of cash from india in the fourth quarter of 2020.
provision for income taxes ê              $11m

the effective tax rate decreased primarily as a result of:
•our decision in 2020 to reverse our indefinite reinvestment assertion on indian earnings accumulated in prior years which resulted in a $140 million tax on accumulated indian earnings recorded as income tax expense in 2020;
•the 2020 samlink impact, which was not deductible for tax purposes;
•the discrete benefit in 2021 of the settlement of the irs examination for tax years 2012 through 2016 as described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements; and
•lower non-deductible foreign currency exchange losses in our consolidated statement of operations in 2021.

we believe providing investors with an operating view consistent with how we manage the company provides enhanced transparency into our operating results. for our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use various gaap and non-gaap financial measures for financial and operational decision-making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons, to determine portions of the compensation for our executive officers and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors. therefore, it is our belief that the use of non-gaap financial measures excluding certain costs provides a meaningful supplemental measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance. we believe that the presentation of our non-gaap financial measures along with reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure, as applicable, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.
a limitation of using non-gaap financial measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap is that non-gaap financial measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance with gaap and may exclude costs that are recurring such as our net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses. in addition, other companies may calculate non-gaap financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-gaap financial measures as a comparative tool. we compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from our non-gaap financial measures to allow investors to evaluate such non-gaap financial measures.

liquidity and capital resources cash generated from operations has historically been our primary source of liquidity to fund operations and investments to grow our business. as of december 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2,719 million. additionally, as of december 31, 2021, we had available capacity under our credit facilities of approximately $1,925 million.
the following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the years ended december 31:

operating activities7
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the deferrals of certain non-income tax payments due to covid-19 pandemic regulatory relief in 2020, a portion of which was remitted in 2021, and higher incentive-based compensation payouts in 2021.
we monitor turnover, aging and the collection of trade accounts receivable by client. our dso calculation includes trade accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses, and contract assets, reduced by the uncollected portion of our deferred revenue. dso was 69 days as of december 31, 2021 and 70 days as of december 31, 2020.
investing activities the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by net purchases of investments as compared to sales in 2020, partially offset by lower payments for acquisitions and capital expenditures.
7 free cash flow is not a measurement of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap. see "non-gaap financial measures" for more information.
cognizant         32       december 31, 2021 form 10-k financing activities the decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily due to lower repurchases of common stock in 2021.
we have a credit agreement providing for a $750 million term loan and a $1,750 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which are due to mature in november 2023. we are required under the credit agreement to make scheduled quarterly principal payments on the term loan. see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the credit agreement to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the remaining available capacity under the revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2021 and through the date of this filing. as of december 31, 2021, we had no outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility.
in february 2021, our india subsidiary renewed its one-year 13 billion indian rupee ($175 million at the december 31, 2021 exchange rate) working capital facility, which requires us to repay any balances drawn down within 90 days from the date of disbursement. there is a 1.0% prepayment penalty applicable to payments made within 30 days of disbursement. this working capital facility contains affirmative and negative covenants and may be renewed annually in february. as of december 31, 2021, there was no balance outstanding under the working capital facility.
capital allocation framework acquisitions share repurchases dividend payments our capital allocation framework anticipates the deployment of approximately 50% of our free cash flow8 for acquisitions, 25% for share repurchases and 25% for dividend payments. we review our capital allocation framework on an ongoing basis, considering the potential impacts of covid-19 pandemic, our financial performance and liquidity position, investments required to execute our strategic plans and initiatives, acquisition opportunities, the economic outlook, regulatory changes and other relevant factors. as these factors may change over time, the actual amounts expended on stock repurchase activity, dividends, and acquisitions, if any, during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time.
other liquidity and capital resources information we seek to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of our domestic and international cash flows and cash balances. we evaluate on an ongoing basis what portion of the non-u.s. cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments is needed locally to execute our strategic plans and what amount is available for repatriation back to the united states.
we expect our operating cash flows, cash and short-term investment balances, together with our available capacity under our revolving credit facilities, to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements, pay our purchase commitments and tax reform act transition tax payments and service our debt for the next twelve months. our tax reform act transition tax payments are due in annual installments of $50 million, $94 million, $126 million and $157 million through 2025. we also have purchase commitments of approximately $263 million which will be paid over the next two years. see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our operating lease obligations.
our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans, make acquisitions, meet our long-term capital requirements beyond a twelve-month period and execute our capital allocation framework will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash flow increases, our ability and willingness to pay for acquisitions with capital stock and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. we cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all.
8 free cash flow is not a measurement of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap. see "non-gaap financial measures" for more information.
cognizant         december 31, 2021 form 10-k critical accounting estimates management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our accompanying consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with gaap. we base our estimates on historical experience, current trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. we evaluate our estimates on a continuous basis. however, the actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
we believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements as they require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. changes to these estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition. revenues related to fixed-price contracts for application development and systems integration services, consulting or other technology services are recognized as the service is performed using the cost to cost method, under which the total value of revenues is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract's total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor costs. revenues related to fixed-price application maintenance, testing and business process services are recognized using the cost to cost method, if the right to invoice is not representative of the value being delivered. the cost to cost method requires estimation of future costs, which is updated as the project progresses to reflect the latest available information. such estimates and changes in estimates involve the use of judgment. the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known. net changes in estimates of such future costs and contract losses were immaterial to the consolidated results of operations for the periods presented.
income taxes. determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred income tax assets (and related valuation allowance, if any) and liabilities requires significant judgment. we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. changes in the geographic mix of income before taxes or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can affect our overall effective income tax rate. in addition, transactions between our affiliated entities are arranged in accordance with applicable transfer pricing laws, regulations and relevant guidelines. as a result, and due to the interpretive nature of certain aspects of these laws and guidelines, we have pending applications for apas before the taxing authorities in some of our most significant jurisdictions. it could take years for the relevant taxing authorities to negotiate and conclude these applications. the consolidated provision for income taxes may change period to period based on changes in facts and circumstances, such as settlements of income tax audits or finalization of our applications for apas.
our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of reserves established for uncertain income tax positions, as well as the related interest, which may require us to apply judgment to complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve. although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not differ from our recorded amounts. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. to the extent that the final outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
business combinations, goodwill and intangible assets. goodwill and intangible assets, including indefinite-lived intangible assets, arise from the accounting for business combinations. we account for business combinations using the acquisition method which requires us to estimate the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, including any contingent consideration, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. the allocation of the purchase price utilizes estimates and assumptions in determining the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets, including the timing and amount of forecasted revenues and cash flows, anticipated growth rates, client attrition rates and the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows.
we exercise judgment to allocate goodwill to the reporting units expected to benefit from each business combination. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, regulatory environment, established business plans, operating performance indicators or competition. evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit.
cognizant         december 31, 2021 form 10-k we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach, utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis, and a market approach, using market multiples. under the income approach, we estimate projected future cash flows, the timing of such cash flows and long-term growth rates, and determine the appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows. the discount rate used is based on a market participant weighted-average cost of capital and may be adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected future cash flows. under the market approach, we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenues and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit. the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions and other factors. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit.
based on our most recent evaluation of goodwill performed during the fourth quarter of 2021, we concluded that the goodwill in each of our reporting units were not at risk of impairment. as of december 31, 2021, our goodwill balance was $5,620 million.
we review our finite-lived assets, including our finite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. the carrying amount may not be recoverable when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset groups. the impairment loss is determined as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. assessing the fair value of asset groups involves significant estimates and assumptions including estimation of future cash flows, the timing of such cash flows and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows.
recently adopted and new accounting pronouncements see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
forward looking statements the statements contained in this annual report on form 10-k that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements (within the meaning of section 21e of the exchange act) that involve risks and uncertainties. such forward-looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use of forward-looking terminology such as "believe," "expect," "may," "could," "would," "plan," "intend," "estimate," "predict," "potential," "continue," "should" or "anticipate" or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. from time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward-looking statements, orally or in writing.

item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview business organization colgate-palmolive company (together with its subsidiaries, "we," "us" "our" the "company" or "colgate") is a caring, innovative growth company reimagining a healthier future for all people, their pets and our planet. we seek to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and superior shareholder returns, as well as to provide colgate people with an innovative and inclusive work environment. we do this by developing and selling products globally that make people's and their pets' lives healthier and more enjoyable and by embracing our sustainability and social impact and de&i strategies across our organization.
we are tightly focused on two product segments: oral, personal and home care; and pet nutrition. within these segments, we follow a closely defined business strategy to grow our key product categories and increase our overall market share. within the categories in which we compete, we prioritize our efforts based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization's core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable, profitable long-term growth.
operationally, we are organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. we compete in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to our sales and profitability. approximately 70% of our net sales are generated from markets outside the u.s., with approximately 45% of our net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of latin america, asia (excluding japan), africa/eurasia and central europe). this geographic diversity and balance help to reduce our exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world.
the oral, personal and home care product segment is managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: north america, latin america, europe, asia pacific and africa/eurasia, all of which sell primarily to a variety of traditional and ecommerce retailers, wholesalers and distributors. through hill's pet nutrition, we also compete on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling products principally through authorized pet supply retailers, veterinarians and ecommerce retailers. we also sell certain of our products direct-to-consumer. we are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale and have major manufacturing facilities, warehousing facilities and distribution centers in every region around the world.
on an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. these indicators include net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), a non-gaap financial measure, and gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, in each case, on a gaap and non-gaap basis, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. in addition, we review market share and other data to assess how our brands are performing within their categories on a global and regional basis. the monitoring of these indicators and our code of conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls. for additional information regarding non-gaap financial measures and the company's use of market share data and the limitations of such data, see "non-gaap financial measures" and "market share information" below.

covid-19
the covid-19 pandemic and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of covid-19 have had and continue to have a profound impact on the way people live, work, interact and shop and have significantly impacted and continue to impact economic activity around the world. we have a well-established crisis management team ("cmt") process, and the cmt, together with our senior management team and colgate people around the world, continue to respond to and manage the challenges presented by covid-19.
during the covid-19 pandemic, many of the communities in which we manufacture, market and sell our products experienced and in some cases continue to experience "stay at home" orders, travel or movement restrictions and other government actions to reduce the spread and address the impact of covid-19, and have implemented varying policies to address the pandemic, resume economic activity and vaccinate their populations. the situation continues to be uncertain and varies by geography, as the impact of covid-19 remains significant in many countries throughout the world, including brazil, china, india, mexico, thailand, the u.s. and vietnam, where we have substantial manufacturing facilities. because the vast majority of our products (such as oral care products, soaps and other personal hygiene products, home cleaners and pet food) have been deemed essential for the health and well-being of people and their pets, we have, in most instances, been able to continue operating our business, although not always at full capacity.
the health, safety and well-being of our employees and their families has been and remains our first priority. while we have reopened most of our offices, in some instances on a limited and voluntary basis, many of our office-based employees globally continue to work from home. we have implemented additional health and safety measures consistent with government recommendations and/or requirements to help ensure employee safety in our offices, production facilities, warehouses and technology centers, often at additional cost. these measures may include: health and temperature screening, social distancing and personal protective equipment protocols, hand washing, contact tracing, enhanced cleaning procedures, respiratory hygiene, education and, in some instances, testing and/or vaccination requirements. in addition, during the covid-19 pandemic, we have seen increased instances of absenteeism and, in some cases, we have experienced some limited production facility closures and related supply chain disruptions. furthermore, some of our suppliers, customers, distributors, logistics providers and service providers have experienced disruptions to their businesses.
we saw a significant increase in demand across many of our categories, such as liquid hand soap, dish liquid, bar soap and cleaners, during 2020 as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, driven by consumer pantry-loading and increased consumption of our products. while consumer demand for most of these categories declined year-over-year in 2021, most still remained above historical levels, and we believe that some of this increase in consumption is sustainable in light of changes in consumer behavior related to covid-19. across our business, changes in consumer demand for our products vary by product category, channel and geography depending on, among other things, the severity of the covid-19 outbreak, the availability of our products at retailers and supply chain disruptions. at the same time, during the covid-19 pandemic, we have experienced disruptions in certain channels, including travel retail. we also continue to see changes in the purchasing patterns of our consumers, including the nature and/or frequency of visits by consumers to retailers and dental, veterinary and skin health professionals and a shift in many markets to purchasing our products online.
covid-19 and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of covid-19 have impacted and may continue to impact our consumers' ability to purchase and our ability to manufacture and distribute our products. while we believe that, in the long-term, consumer demand for the products in our categories will continue to be strong, uncertainties continue surrounding the covid-19 pandemic. these uncertainties include: the impact of the timing and scale of changes to travel and movement restrictions in certain geographies, the availability and widespread distribution and use of covid-19 vaccines, the emergence and spread of covid-19 variants, the timing and impact of consumer pantry-loading and destocking activity in certain markets, product demand trends and the impact of covid-19 on the global economy, including as a result of inflation, and supply chain disruptions. covid-19 has also disrupted our retail customers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers and other third parties; their ability to address covid-19 and maintain their operations at full capacity has impacted and may continue to impact sales of and consumer access to our products. we expect the ongoing economic impact and health concerns associated with covid-19 to continue to impact consumer behavior, shopping patterns and consumption preferences during 2022.
while we currently expect to be able to continue operating our business as described above and we intend to continue to work with government authorities and to follow the necessary protocols to maintain the health and safety of our employees and third parties, uncertainty resulting from covid-19 could result in an unforeseen additional disruption to our business, including our global supply chain and retailer network, and/or require us to incur additional operational costs.

business strategy to achieve our business and financial objectives, we are focused on driving organic sales growth and long-term profitable growth through innovation on our core businesses; leveraging faster growth in adjacent categories; expanding in high-growth channels and markets and delivering margin expansion through operating leverage and efficiency. we are also seeking to maximize the impact of our esg programs and leading in the development of human capital, including our sustainability and social impact and de&i strategies, which we are working to integrate across our organization. we are strengthening our capabilities in areas such as innovation, digital, ecommerce and data and analytics enabling us to be more responsive in today's rapidly changing world. in particular, we believe our digital transformation is of paramount importance to our success going forward. we continue to invest behind our brands, including through advertising, and to develop initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental, veterinary and skin health professionals and traditional and ecommerce retailers. we also continue to broaden our ecommerce offerings, including direct-to-consumer and subscription services. we continue to believe that growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for our products.
we are also changing the way we work to drive growth and how we approach innovation with focus, empowerment, experimentation and digitization to respond to the dynamic retail landscape and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers. the retail landscape, the ease of new entrants into the market in many of our categories and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers demand that we work differently and faster in an agile, authentic and culturally relevant manner to drive innovation.
the investments needed to drive growth are supported through continuous, company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. through these initiatives, which are referred to as our funding-the-growth initiatives, we seek to become even more effective and efficient throughout our businesses. these initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials, among other things, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through sku reductions and formulation simplification. we also continue to prioritize our investments in high growth segments within our oral care, personal care and pet nutrition businesses, including by expanding our portfolio in premium skin health.
on january 27, 2022, the board approved a targeted productivity program (the "2022 global productivity initiative"). the program is intended to reallocate resources towards our strategic priorities and faster growth businesses, drive efficiencies in our operations and streamline our supply chain to reduce structural costs. implementation of the 2022 global productivity initiative, which is expected to be substantially completed by december 31, 2022, is projected to result in cumulative pre-tax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, totaling between $200 and $240, which are currently estimated to be comprised of the following: employee-related costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (80%); asset-related costs, primarily accelerated depreciation and asset write-downs (10%); and other charges (10%), which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies. it is estimated that approximately 90% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. for more information regarding the 2022 global productivity initiative, see "restructuring and related implementation charges" below.
significant items impacting comparability in the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a non-cash charge of $571 pretax ($518 aftertax) to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible related to the filorga skin health business. the impairment was due primarily to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the filorga business as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels. see note 5, goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
in 1990, our canadian subsidiary ("cp canada"), issued c$145 of canadian dollar-denominated unsecured unsubordinated 12.85% guaranteed notes due october 4, 2030 (the "canada notes"). in the third quarter of 2021, cp canada redeemed the canada notes and recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $75 pretax ($55 aftertax), which is included in interest (income) expense, net in the consolidated statements of income, representing the difference between the redemption price and the carrying amount of the debt extinguished.

in 2019, we received a favorable judgment regarding certain value-added tax previously paid in brazil. as a result of this favorable judgment, during the fourth quarter of 2019, we filed an application with the brazilian government to recover value-added tax previously paid and recorded a benefit. in may 2021, the brazilian supreme court issued a clarifying ruling allowing a higher deduction of state value-added tax when determining the taxable base. in light of this ruling, we recorded an additional benefit of $26 pretax ($20 aftertax) in the year ended december 31, 2021.
the global growth and efficiency program, a multi-year restructuring program, concluded on december 31, 2019. initiatives under the global growth and efficiency program fit within the program's three focus areas of expanding commercial hubs, extending shared business services and streamlining global functions and optimizing the global supply chain and facilities. during the year ended december 31, 2020, we adjusted the accrual balances related to certain projects approved prior to the conclusion of the global growth and efficiency program to reflect our revised estimate of remaining liabilities, which resulted in a reduction of $16 ($13 aftertax) to restructuring accruals. for more information regarding the global growth and efficiency program, see note 4, restructuring and related implementation charges to the consolidated financial statements.
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2020 includes $71 of income tax benefits, of which $45 relates to previously recorded foreign withholding taxes and $26 relates to a previously recorded valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset. as described more fully in "results of operations-income taxes," below, both items were previously recorded in connection with the charge recorded in 2017 and revised in 2018 related to the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tcja").
on january 31, 2020, we acquired hello products llc ("hello"), an oral care business, for cash consideration of $351. the acquisition was financed with a combination of debt and cash. this acquisition is part of our strategy to focus on high growth segments within our oral care, personal care and pet nutrition businesses. see note 3, acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
outlook looking forward, we expect global macroeconomic, political and market conditions to remain challenging, especially due to covid-19. during the year ended december 31, 2021, all of our divisions experienced significantly higher raw and packaging material costs. we also incurred increased logistics costs due to volume and capacity constraints in the shipping and logistics industry and higher ecommerce demand. we expect this difficult cost environment to continue in 2022.
while the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive, we continue to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors, from other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than we do, and from new entrants into the market in many of our categories. such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion.
we have been negatively affected by changes in the policies and practices of our trade customers in key markets, such as inventory de-stocking, fulfillment requirements, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products and certain environmental, sustainability, supply chain and packaging standards or initiatives. in addition, the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the rapid growth of ecommerce, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online and via mobile and social applications) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer businesses. these trends have been magnified due to covid-19 in many of our geographies and we plan to continue to invest behind our digital and analytics capabilities and higher growth businesses, such as ecommerce. this rapid growth in ecommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures and/or adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers.
in addition, given that approximately 70% of our net sales originate in markets outside the u.s., we have experienced and will likely continue to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations. as discussed above, we have also experienced higher raw and packaging material and logistics costs. while we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, such as the 2022 global productivity initiative and our funding the growth and revenue growth management initiatives, including additional pricing, in the current environment, it may become increasingly difficult to implement certain of these mitigation strategies. should these conditions persist, they could adversely affect our future results.

as discussed above, we continue to closely monitor the impact of covid-19 on our business. during 2020 as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, we saw a significant increase in demand across many of our categories, such as liquid hand soap, dish liquid, bar soap and cleaners. while consumer demand for most of these categories declined year-over-year in 2021, most remained above historical levels. we believe that some of this increased consumption is sustainable due to consumer behavior changes related to covid-19. we expect increased volatility across all of our categories, and it is therefore difficult to predict category growth rates in the near term. covid-19 has also disrupted our retail customers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers and other third parties; their ability to address covid-19 and maintain their operations at full capacity has impacted and may continue to impact sales of and consumer access to our products. while we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effects of covid-19, we cannot estimate with certainty the full extent of covid-19's impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition. for more information about factors that could impact our business, including due to covid-19, see "risk factors" in part i, item 1a of this annual report.
in summary, we believe that we are well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to our strong financial condition, broad based experience operating in challenging environments, resilient global supply chain and focused business strategy. our strategy is based on driving organic sales growth and long-term profitable growth through innovation within our core businesses, leveraging faster growth in adjacent categories, expanding in high-growth channels and markets and delivering margin expansion through operating leverage and efficiency. we are also seeking to maximize the impact of our environmental, social and governance programs and leading in the development of human capital, including our sustainability and social impact and de&i strategies. our commitment to these priorities, the strength of our brands, the breadth of our global footprint and a commitment to driving efficiency in cash generation should position us well to manage through the challenges presented by covid-19 and increase shareholder value over time.

net sales worldwide net sales were $17,421 in 2021, up 6.0% from 2020, due to volume growth of 1.0%, net selling price increases of 3.5%, and positive foreign exchange of 1.5%. organic sales (net sales excluding, as applicable, the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), a non-gaap financial measure as discussed below, increased 4.5% in 2021.
net sales in the oral, personal and home care product segment were $14,110 in 2021, up 4.0% from 2020, due to net selling price increases of 2.5% and positive foreign exchange of 1.5%, while volume was flat. organic sales in the oral, personal and home care product segment increased 2.5% in 2021.
the increase in organic sales in 2021 versus 2020 was due to an increase in oral care organic sales, partially offset by a decrease in personal care organic sales. the increase in oral care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste, manual toothbrush and mouthwash categories. the decrease in personal care was primarily due to organic sales declines in the liquid hand soap and bar soap categories.
the company's share of the global toothpaste market was 39.4% for full year 2021, down 0.3 share points from full year 2020, and its share of the global manual toothbrush market was 30.9% for full year 2021, up 0.1 share points from full year 2020. full year 2021 market shares in toothpaste were up in europe and africa/eurasia and down in north america, latin america and asia pacific versus full year 2020. in the manual toothbrush category, full year 2021 market shares were up in latin america, europe and africa/eurasia and down in north america and asia pacific versus full year 2020. for additional information regarding the company's use of market share data and limitations of such data, see "market share information" below.

gross profit/margin worldwide gross profit increased 4% to $10,375 in 2021 from $10,017 in 2020. gross profit in 2020 included acquisition-related costs. excluding acquisition-related costs in 2020, gross profit increased to $10,375 in 2021 from $10,021 in 2020, reflecting an increase of $565 resulting from higher net sales and a decrease of $211 resulting from lower gross profit margin.
worldwide gross profit margin decreased to 59.6% in 2021 from 60.8% in 2020. this decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs (450 bps), partially offset by cost savings from the company's funding-the-growth initiatives (210 bps) and higher pricing (120 bps).

goodwill & indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges the company made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to its filorga reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2021 due primarily to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the filorga skin health business as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels. the company concluded that the changes in circumstances in this reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its indefinite-lived trademark and goodwill and, accordingly, performed an interim impairment test for the trademark as of december 31, 2021. the company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark exceeded its estimated fair value, and recorded an impairment charge of $204, reducing the carrying value to approximately $588. after adjusting the carrying value of the trademark, the company completed a quantitative impairment test for goodwill and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $367 in the filorga reporting unit, reducing the carrying value of goodwill to approximately $577. the company continues to believe in the strength of the filorga brand and is confident about its growth opportunities. see note 5, goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

(1) the income tax effect on non-gaap items is calculated based upon the tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-gaap adjustment.
(2) the impact of non-gaap items on the company's effective tax rate represents the difference in the effective tax rate calculated with and without the non-gaap adjustment on income before income taxes and provision for income taxes.
the provision for income taxes for 2020 includes $71 of income tax benefits, of which $45 relates to previously recorded foreign withholding taxes and $26 relates to a previously recorded valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset. as described more fully below, both items were previously recorded in connection with the charge recorded by the company in 2017 and revised in 2018 related to the tcja.
as part of the previously recorded charge for the tcja, the company had provided for foreign withholding taxes expected to be paid on the remittance of earnings from certain overseas subsidiaries no longer deemed indefinitely reinvested. as a result of a reorganization of the ownership structure of certain foreign subsidiaries, the company determined that no withholding taxes will be due on the remittance by certain subsidiaries of earnings previously deemed reinvested and, accordingly, reversed $45 of previously recorded foreign withholding taxes in the first quarter of 2020.
also as part of the previously recorded charge for the tcja, the company provided a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset related to foreign tax credit carry-forwards that the company did not expect to be able to use due to changes made by the tcja. as a result of a new operating structure implemented within one of the company's divisions, the company believes the use of these foreign tax credit carry-forwards will not be limited in the future and, accordingly, reversed the previously recorded valuation allowance of $26 in the first quarter of 2020.
the effective income tax rate in all years benefited from tax planning associated with the company's global business initiatives.

non-gaap financial measures this annual report on form 10-k discusses certain financial measures on both a gaap and a non-gaap basis. the company uses the non-gaap financial measures described below internally in its budgeting process, to evaluate segment and overall operating performance and as a factor in determining compensation. the company believes that these non-gaap financial measures are useful in evaluating the company's underlying business performance and trends; however, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap. in addition, these non-gaap financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies.
net sales growth (gaap) and organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) (non-gaap) are discussed in this annual report on form 10-k. management believes the organic sales growth measure provides investors and analysts with useful supplemental information regarding the company's underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding, the external factor of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestments, as applicable. a reconciliation of organic sales growth to net sales growth for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020 is provided below.

market share information management uses market share information as a key indicator to monitor business health and performance. references to market share in this annual report on form 10-k are based on a combination of consumption and market share data provided by third-party vendors, primarily nielsen, and internal estimates. all market share references represent the percentage of the dollar value of sales of our products, relative to all product sales in the category in the countries in which the company competes and purchases data (excluding venezuela from all periods).
market share data is subject to limitations on the availability of up-to-date information. in particular, market share data is currently not generally available for certain retail channels, such as ecommerce or certain discounters. the company measures year-to-date market shares from january 1 of the relevant year through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months. the company believes that the third-party vendors we use to provide data are reliable, but we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of the data or any assumptions underlying the data. in certain limited circumstances, the covid-19 pandemic has impacted the ability of our third-party vendors to provide the company with reliable updated market share data. in addition, market share information calculated by the company may be different from market share information calculated by other companies due to differences in category definitions, the use of data from different countries, internal estimates and other factors.

_______
(1)the company classifies commercial paper and notes maturing within the next 12 months as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis. the amounts in this table exclude such obligations.
(2)includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management's best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt.
(3)the company had outstanding contractual obligations with suppliers at the end of 2021 for the purchase of raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. these purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms including minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases.
long-term liabilities associated with the company's postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. the amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in "critical accounting policies and use of estimates" below) and voluntary company contributions. based on current information, the company is not required to make a mandatory contribution to its qualified u.s. pension plan in 2021. the company does not expect to make any voluntary contributions to its u.s. postretirement plans in 2022. in addition, total benefit payments expected to be paid from the company's assets to participants in unfunded plans are estimated to be approximately $89 for the year ending december 31, 2022.
additionally, liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities. see note 11, income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
as more fully described in note 13, commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements, the company has commitments and contingencies with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
(dollars in millions except per share amounts)
off-balance sheet arrangements the company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.
managing foreign currency, interest rate, commodity price and credit risk exposure the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the company's treasury and risk management policies. the company's treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose.
the sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below. see note 2, summary of significant accounting policies and note 7, fair value measurements and financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements.
foreign exchange risk as the company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. the company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost-containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. see "results of operations" above for a discussion of the foreign exchange impact on net sales in each operating segment.
the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders' equity. income and expense items are translated into u.s. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.
the company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, option contracts, foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. the duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates.
the company's foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $12 and net unrealized loss of $11 at december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. at the end of 2021, an unfavorable 10% change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $76.
(dollars in millions except per share amounts)
interest rate risk the company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. the company utilizes forward-starting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rate for future debt issuances. the notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates.
based on year-end 2021 variable rate debt levels, a 1% increase in interest rates would have increased interest (income) expense, net by $14 in 2021.
the company is assessing the impact of the discontinuation of libor as a benchmark interest rate on its current financial instruments and contractual arrangements, including debt outstanding, and believes it will not be material as the company does not have significant exposure to libor in either its debt or other financing arrangements. the company will continue to monitor its exposure in subsequent periods.
commodity price risk the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as essential oils, resins, tropical oils, pulp, tallow, corn, poultry and soybeans. the company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the hill's pet nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities.
the company's open commodity derivative contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $2 and $3 at december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. at the end of 2021, an unfavorable 10% change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $1.
credit risk the company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the company's policy to contract with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations.

in october 2021, the fasb issued asu no. 2021-08, "business combinations (topic 805): accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers." this asu requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with asu no. 2016-10, "revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606)." this guidance is effective for the company beginning on january 1, 2023 and is not expected to have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.

critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgment and make estimates. the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. the company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors.
in certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. the company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.
▪the company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ("fifo") method (75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ("lifo") method (25% of inventories). there would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2021 or 2020 had all inventories been accounted for under the fifo method.
▪shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses. the company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the consolidated statements of income as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. accordingly, the company's gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. if such costs had been included as a component of cost of sales, the company's gross profit margin would have been lower by 968 bps in 2021, by 845 bps in 2020, and 810 bps in 2019, with no impact on reported earnings.
the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances, legal and other contingency reserves.

▪in accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for u.s. defined benefit plans was 2.98% and 2.65% as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other u.s. postretirement plans was 3.06%, and 2.88% as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. discount rates used for the u.s. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds whose projected cash flows approximate the projected benefit payments of the plans. the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for u.s. plans was 5.70% as of december 31, 2021 and 2020. in determining the expected long-term rate of return, the company considers the nature of the plans' investments and the historical rate of return.
average annual rates of return for the u.s. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were 3%, 8%, 8%, 6% and 7%, respectively. in addition, the current assumed rate of return for the u.s. plans is based upon the nature of the plans' investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 76% in fixed income securities, 21% in equity securities and 3% in real estate and other investments. a 1% change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the u.s. pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company by approximately $18. a 1% change in the discount rate for the u.s. pension plans and u.s. other retiree benefit plan would impact future net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company by approximately $2 and $10, respectively. a third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the expected long-term rate of return. this rate was 3.50% as of december 31, 2021, and 2020. refer to note 10, retirement plans and other retiree benefits to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company's pension and other postretirement plans.
▪the assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits (other than the discount rate noted above) is the medical cost trend rate. the company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. the assumed rate of increase for the u.s. postretirement benefit plans is 6.00% for 2022, declining to 4.75% by 2026 and remaining at 4.75% for the years thereafter. the effect on the total of service cost and interest costs components of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would decrease net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company by $11.
▪the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock units (both performance-based and time-vested), based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. the company uses the black-scholes-merton ("black-scholes") option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. the weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended december 31, 2021 was $11.11. the black-scholes model uses various assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. these assumptions include the expected term of stock option awards, expected volatility rate, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. while these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in the fair value of stock option awards. a one-year change in expected term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 4%. a 1% change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 6%. the company uses a monte-carlo simulation to determine the fair value of performance-based restricted stock units at the date of grant. the monte-carlo simulation model uses substantially the same inputs as the black-scholes model.
▪goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, such as the company's global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired. in assessing impairment, the company performs either a quantitative or a qualitative analysis.
(dollars in millions except per share amounts)
determining the fair value of the company's reporting units for goodwill and the fair value of its intangible assets requires significant estimates and judgments by management. when a quantitative analysis is performed, the company generally uses the income approach, which requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management's strategic plans, sales growth rates, foreign exchange rates and the selection of royalty rates and a discount rate. estimating sales growth rates requires significant judgment by management in areas such as future economic conditions, category growth rates, product pricing, consumer tastes and preferences and future expansion expectations. in selecting an appropriate royalty rate, the company considers recent market transactions for similar brands and products. in determining an appropriate discount rate, the company considers the current interest rate environment and its estimated cost of capital. other qualitative factors the company considers, in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above, include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions, industry-specific considerations and historical financial performance. the company generally engages a third-party valuation firm to assist it in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.
in determining the fair value of the company's reporting units, fair value is also determined using the market approach, which is generally derived from metrics of comparable publicly traded companies. as multiple valuation methodologies are used, the company also performs a qualitative analysis comparing the fair value of a reporting unit under each method to assess its reasonableness and ensure consistency of results.
determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of several factors including market share, brand history, future expansion expectations, the level of in-market support anticipated by management, legal or regulatory restrictions and the economic environment in the countries in which the brand is sold.
the company made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to its filorga reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2021 due primarily to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the filorga skin health business as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels. the company concluded that the changes in circumstances in this reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its indefinite-lived trademark and goodwill and, accordingly, performed an interim impairment test for the trademark as of december 31, 2021. the company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark exceeded its estimated fair value, and recorded an impairment charge of $204, reducing the carrying value to approximately $588. after adjusting the carrying value of the trademark, the company completed a quantitative impairment test for goodwill and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $367 in the filorga reporting unit, reducing the carrying value of goodwill to approximately $577.
except for the filorga skin health business, as described above, the estimated fair value of the company's reporting units substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value. the fair value of the company's indefinite-life intangible assets other than filorga exceeds their recorded carrying value by at least 20%. therefore, it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets.
▪the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolution.
▪tax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets, such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income.

▪legal and other contingency reserves are based on management's assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors. such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. while it is possible that the company's cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies, based on current knowledge it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material effect on the company's financial position, or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows. refer to note 13, commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company's contingencies.
the company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. refer to note 2, summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the company's significant accounting policies.

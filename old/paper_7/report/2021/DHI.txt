item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to promote an understanding of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results. md&a is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this form 10-k. this section generally discusses the results of operations for fiscal 2021 compared to 2020. for similar operating and financial data and discussion of our fiscal 2020 results compared to our fiscal 2019 results, refer to item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" under part ii of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020, which was filed with the sec on november 20, 2020.
the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to any differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed under the caption "forward-looking statements" and under item 1a, "risk factors."
results of operations - overview fiscal 2021 operating results in fiscal 2021, our number of homes closed and home sales revenues increased 25% and 35%, respectively, compared to the prior year, and our consolidated revenues increased 37% to $27.8 billion compared to $20.3 billion in the prior year. our pre-tax income was $5.4 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to $3.0 billion in fiscal 2020, and our pre-tax operating margin was 19.3% compared to 14.7%. net income was $4.2 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to $2.4 billion in fiscal 2020, and our diluted earnings per share was $11.41 compared to $6.41.
cash provided by our homebuilding operations was $1.2 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to $1.9 billion in fiscal 2020. in fiscal 2021, our return on equity (roe) was 31.6% compared to 22.1% in fiscal 2020, and our homebuilding return on inventory (roi) was 37.9% compared to 24.6%. roe is calculated as net income attributable to d.r. horton for the year divided by average stockholders' equity, where average stockholders' equity is the sum of ending stockholders' equity balances of the trailing five quarters divided by five. homebuilding roi is calculated as homebuilding pre-tax income for the year divided by average inventory, where average inventory is the sum of ending homebuilding inventory balances for the trailing five quarters divided by five.
during march 2020, the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic and the related widespread reductions in economic activity across the united states began to adversely affect our business. as economic activity resumed and restrictive orders relating to covid-19 were eased, demand for our homes improved significantly during the remainder of fiscal 2020 and remained strong throughout fiscal 2021. we believe the increase in demand has been fueled by historically low interest rates on mortgage loans and the limited supply of homes at affordable price points across most of our markets. we are well-positioned for increased demand with our affordable product offerings, lot supply and housing inventory. however, multiple disruptions in the supply chain, combined with the improvement in economic conditions and strong demand for new homes, have resulted in shortages in certain building materials and tightness in the labor market, which has caused our construction cycle to lengthen. we have slowed our home sales pace to more closely align with our production levels, and we are selling homes later in the construction cycle when we have more certainty regarding the home close date for our homebuyers. based on the current availability of labor and materials, the stage of completion of our current homes in inventory, production schedules and capacity, we expect to continue restricting the pace of our sales orders in many of our communities in the near term to match our production levels.
within our homebuilding land and lot portfolio, our lots controlled through purchase contracts represent 76% of the lots owned and controlled at september 30, 2021 compared to 70% at september 30, 2020. our relationship with forestar and expanded relationships with other land developers across the country have allowed us to continue to increase the controlled portion of our lot pipeline.
we believe our strong balance sheet and liquidity position provide us with the flexibility to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. we plan to continue to generate strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and manage our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments in each of our communities based on local housing market conditions.
strategy our operating strategy focuses on enhancing long-term value to our shareholders by leveraging our financial and competitive position in our core homebuilding business to maximize the returns on our inventory investments and generate strong profitability and cash flows, while managing risk and maintaining financial flexibility to navigate changing economic conditions and make opportunistic strategic investments. our strategy remains consistent and includes the following initiatives:
•developing and retaining highly experienced and productive teams of personnel throughout our company that are aligned and focused on continuous improvement in our operational execution and financial performance.
•maintaining a strong cash balance and overall liquidity position and controlling our level of debt.
•allocating and actively managing our inventory investments across our operating markets to diversify our geographic risk.
•offering new home communities that appeal to a broad range of entry-level, move-up, active adult and luxury homebuyers based on consumer demand in each market.
•modifying product offerings, sales pace, home prices and sales incentives as necessary in each of our markets to meet consumer demand and maintain affordability.
•delivering high quality homes and a positive experience to our customers both during and after the sale.
•managing our inventory of homes under construction relative to demand in each of our markets, including starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand and actively controlling the number of unsold, completed homes in inventory.
•investing in land and land development in desirable markets, while controlling the level of land and lots we own in each market relative to the local new home demand.
•continuing to seek opportunities to expand the portion of our land and finished lots controlled through purchase contracts with forestar and other land developers.
•controlling the cost of goods purchased from both vendors and subcontractors.
•improving the efficiency of our land development, construction, sales and other key operational activities.
•controlling our selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expense infrastructure to match production levels.
•opportunistically evaluating potential acquisitions to enhance our operations and improve returns.
•ensuring that our financial services business provides high quality mortgage and title services to homebuyers efficiently and effectively.
•increasing our investments in the construction and leasing of single-family and multi-family rental properties to meet rental demand in high growth suburban markets and selling these properties profitably.
we believe our operating strategy, which has produced positive results in recent years, will allow us to successfully operate through changing economic conditions to maintain and improve our financial and competitive position. however, we cannot provide any assurances that the initiatives listed above will continue to be successful, and we may need to adjust parts of our strategy to meet future market conditions.

net sales orders
2021 versus 2020
the number of net sales orders increased 4% during 2021 compared to 2020, and the value of net sales orders increased 18% to $27.7 billion (81,378 homes) in 2021 from $23.6 billion (78,458 homes) in 2020. the average selling price of net sales orders during fiscal 2021 was $341,000, up 13% from the prior year.
during fiscal 2021, demand for homes remained strong. however, multiple disruptions in the supply chain, combined with the improvement in economic conditions and strong demand for new homes, have resulted in shortages in certain building materials and tightness in the labor market, which has caused our construction cycle to lengthen. as a result, during the second half of fiscal 2021, we slowed our home sales pace to more closely align with our production levels, and we are selling homes later in the construction cycle when we have more certainty regarding the home close date for our homebuyers. based on the stage of completion of our current homes in inventory, production schedules and capacity, we expect to continue restricting the pace of our sales orders in many of our communities in the near term to match our production levels. although these challenges may persist for some time, we expect to ultimately increase our production capacity and close more homes in fiscal 2022 than we closed in fiscal 2021.
in regions with an increase in sales volume, the markets contributing most to the increases were the san antonio and dallas markets in the south central and the florida markets (particularly tampa) in the southeast. in regions with a decrease in sales volume, the markets having the most effect were as follows: the seattle and portland markets in the northwest; the phoenix market in the southwest; the charlotte and atlanta markets in the east; and the minneapolis market in the north.
our sales order cancellation rate (cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders for the period) was 17% in 2021 compared to 20% in 2020.
2020 versus 2019
the number of net sales orders increased 39% during 2020 compared to 2019, with significant increases in all of our regions. the value of net sales orders increased 40% to $23.6 billion (78,458 homes) in 2020 from $16.8 billion (56,565 homes) in 2019. the average selling price of net sales orders during 2020 was $300,900, up 1% from the prior year.
the markets contributing most to the increases in sales volumes in our regions were as follows: the denver and portland markets in the northwest; the phoenix and california markets in the southwest; the houston and dallas markets in the south central; the florida markets (particularly tampa) in the southeast; the carolina markets (particularly myrtle beach and charlotte) in the east; and the minneapolis, delaware and indiana markets in the north.

home sales revenue
2021 versus 2020
revenues from home sales increased 35% to $26.5 billion (81,965 homes closed) in 2021 from $19.6 billion (65,388 homes closed) in 2020. home sales revenues increased in all of our regions due to an increase in the number of homes closed and to a lesser extent, an increase in average selling prices.
the number of homes closed in 2021 increased 25% from 2020. the markets contributing most to the increased closing volumes in our regions were as follows: the denver and salt lake city markets in the northwest; the phoenix and california markets in the southwest; the houston and dallas markets in the south central; the florida markets (particularly tampa) in the southeast; the carolina markets (particularly myrtle beach) in the east; and the indiana and delaware markets in the north.
2020 versus 2019
revenues from home sales increased 16% to $19.6 billion (65,388 homes closed) in 2020 from $16.9 billion (56,975 homes closed) in 2019. home sales revenues increased in all of our regions primarily due to an increase in the number of homes closed.
the number of homes closed in 2020 increased 15% from 2019. the markets contributing most to the increase in closing volumes in our regions were as follows: the denver and portland markets in the northwest; the california markets in the southwest; the houston, dallas and san antonio markets in the south central; the florida markets (particularly tampa) in the southeast; the carolina markets (particularly myrtle beach and charlotte) in the east; and the delaware, indiana and iowa markets in the north.

home sales gross profit
2021 versus 2020
gross profit from home sales increased to $6.9 billion in 2021 from $4.3 billion in 2020 and increased 370 basis points to 25.5% as a percentage of home sales revenues. the percentage increase resulted from improvements of 340 basis points due to the average selling price of our homes closed increasing by more than the average cost of those homes, 20 basis points due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest and 10 basis points due to a decrease in warranty and construction defect costs.
we remain focused on managing the pricing, incentives and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the returns on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand. these actions could cause our gross profit margins to fluctuate in future periods. if new home demand declines from current levels, we would expect our gross profit margins to also decline.
2020 versus 2019
gross profit from home sales increased to $4.3 billion in 2020 from $3.4 billion in 2019 and increased 160 basis points to 21.8% as a percentage of home sales revenues. the percentage increase resulted from improvements of 150 basis points due to a decrease in the average cost of our homes closed while the average selling price increased slightly, 20 basis points from a decrease in the amount of purchase accounting adjustments related to prior year acquisitions and 10 basis points due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest, partially offset by increased warranty and construction defect costs of 20 basis points.
land/lot sales and other revenues land/lot sales and other revenues from our homebuilding operations were $75.0 million, $80.7 million and $91.9 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. we continually evaluate our land and lot supply, and fluctuations in revenues and profitability from land sales occur based on how we manage our inventory levels in various markets. we generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them. however, some of the land that we purchase includes commercially zoned parcels that we may sell to commercial developers. we may also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our supply or for other strategic reasons. as of september 30, 2021, our homebuilding operations had $25.4 million of land held for sale that we expect to sell in the next twelve months.
inventory and land option charges at the end of each quarter, we review the performance and outlook for all of our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment and perform detailed impairment evaluations and analyses when necessary. as of september 30, 2021, we determined that no communities were impaired, and no impairment charges were recorded during the three months ended september 30, 2021. there were $5.6 million of homebuilding impairment charges recorded during fiscal 2021 compared to $1.7 million and $24.9 million of impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.
as we manage our inventory investments across our operating markets to optimize returns and cash flows, we may modify our pricing and incentives, construction and development plans or land sale strategies in individual active communities and land held for development, which could result in the affected communities being evaluated for potential impairment. if the housing market or economic conditions are adversely affected for a prolonged period, we may be required to evaluate additional communities for potential impairment. these evaluations could result in additional impairment charges, which could be significant.
during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs related to land purchase contracts that we have terminated or expect to terminate were $19.3 million, $21.2 million and $28.3 million, respectively.
selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expense sg&a expense from homebuilding activities was $1.9 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of 22% in 2021 and 8% in 2020 from the respective prior years. sg&a expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenues was 7.3%, 8.1% and 8.7% in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
employee compensation and related costs were $1.6 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing 81%, 75% and 72% of sg&a costs in those years. these costs increased 31% in 2021 and 13% in 2020. our homebuilding operations employed 8,429, 7,281 and 6,810 people at september 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
we attempt to control our sg&a costs while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our operations; however, we cannot make assurances that we will be able to maintain or improve upon the current sg&a expense as a percentage of revenues.
interest incurred we capitalize interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and construction (active inventory). capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer. interest incurred by our homebuilding operations was $93.6 million, $93.0 million and $104.7 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. interest charged to cost of sales was 0.7%, 0.8% and 0.9% of total cost of sales (excluding inventory and land option charges) in those years.
other income other income, net of other expenses, included in our homebuilding operations was $10.3 million, $11.7 million and $9.5 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. other income consists of interest income and various other types of ancillary income, gains, expenses and losses not directly associated with sales of homes, land and lots. the activities that result in this ancillary income are not significant, either individually or in the aggregate.
business acquisition in october 2020, we acquired the homebuilding operations of braselton homes in corpus christi, texas for approximately $23.0 million in cash. the assets acquired included approximately 90 homes in inventory, 95 lots and control of approximately 840 additional lots through purchase contracts. we also acquired a sales order backlog of approximately 125 homes.

homebuilding inventories, land and lot position and homes in inventory we routinely enter into contracts to purchase land or developed residential lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with planned development or anticipated new home demand. at the time of purchase, the undeveloped land is generally vested with the rights to begin development or construction work, and we plan and coordinate the development of our land into residential lots for use in our homebuilding business. we manage our inventory of owned land and lots and homes under construction relative to demand in each of our markets, including starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand and actively controlling the number of unsold, completed homes in inventory.

mortgage loan activity the volume of loans originated by our mortgage operations is directly related to the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations. in fiscal 2021, the volume of first-lien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased 23% from the prior year due to a 25% increase in the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations.
homes closed by our homebuilding operations constituted 98% and 97% of dhi mortgage loan originations in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. these percentages reflect dhi mortgage's consistent focus on the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations.
the number of loans sold increased 24% in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year. virtually all of the mortgage loans held for sale on september 30, 2021 were eligible for sale to fannie mae, freddie mac or ginnie mae. during fiscal 2021, approximately 52% of our mortgage loans were sold directly to fannie mae or into securities backed by ginnie mae, and 41% were sold to two other major financial entities. changes in market conditions could result in a greater concentration of our mortgage sales in future periods to fewer financial entities and directly to fannie mae or ginnie mae, and we may need to make other adjustments to our mortgage operations.
financial services revenues and expenses revenues from our mortgage operations increased 41% to $670.8 million in fiscal 2021 from $476.7 million in fiscal 2020, primarily due to a 22% increase in loan originations and higher net gains achieved on the sale of loan originations in the secondary market. revenues from our title operations increased 41% to $152.8 million in fiscal 2021 from $108.2 million in fiscal 2020, primarily due to a 30% increase in escrow closings.
general and administrative (g&a) expense related to our financial services operations increased 34% to $488.3 million in fiscal 2021 from $364.7 million in the prior year. the increase was primarily due to an increase in employee related costs to support a higher volume of transactions. our financial services operations employed 2,891 and 2,163 people at september 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
as a percentage of financial services revenues, g&a expense was 59.3% in fiscal 2021 compared to 62.4% in the prior year. fluctuations in financial services g&a expense as a percentage of revenues can occur because some components of revenue fluctuate differently than loan volumes, and some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the amount of revenue earned.
other income, net of other expense, included in our financial services operations consists primarily of the interest income of our mortgage subsidiary.
as a result of the revenue increase from a higher volume of mortgage originations and escrow closings and better leverage of our g&a expenses, pre-tax income from our financial services operations increased 49% to $364.6 million in fiscal 2021 from $245.2 million in fiscal 2020.
results of operations - rental our rental segment consists of multi-family and single-family rental operations. the multi-family rental operations develop, construct, lease, own and ultimately sell the residential properties. we primarily focus on constructing garden style multi-family rental communities, which typically accommodate 200 to 400 dwelling units, in high growth suburban markets. the single-family rental operations construct single-family rental homes with the intent to later market the community for a bulk sale of homes. multi-family and single-family rental property sales are recognized as revenues, and rental income is recognized as other income. results of operations for the rental segment for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:

during fiscal 2021, we sold three multi-family rental properties for $191.9 million (960 total units) compared to two properties (540 total units) in fiscal 2020 for $128.5 million. during fiscal 2021, we sold three single-family rental properties (260 total homes) for $75.9 million. there were no bulk sales of single-family rental properties in fiscal 2020.
at september 30, 2021, our rental property inventory of $840.9 million included $425.1 million of assets related to our multi-family rental operations and $415.8 million of assets related to our single-family rental operations. at september 30, 2021, we had 15 multi-family rental properties under active construction and one community that was substantially complete and in the lease-up phase. these 16 communities represent 4,690 multi-family units, including 4,340 units under active construction and 350 completed units. at september 30, 2021, our single-family rental properties (55 total communities) included 2,650 homes and finished lots, of which 865 homes were completed.
at september 30, 2020, our rental property inventory of $316.0 million included $229.9 million of assets related to our multi-family rental operations and $86.1 million of assets related to our single-family rental operations. at september 30, 2020, we had five multi-family rental properties under active construction and one community that was substantially complete and in the lease-up phase. these six communities represent 1,730 multi-family units, including 1,430 units under active construction and 300 completed units. at september 30, 2020, our single-family rental properties (10 total communities) included 740 homes and finished lots, of which 440 homes were completed.
results of operations - other businesses in addition to our homebuilding, forestar, financial services and rental operations, we engage in other business activities through our subsidiaries. we conduct insurance-related operations, own non-residential real estate including ranch land and improvements and own and operate energy related assets. the pre-tax income of all of our subsidiaries engaged in other business activities was $32.7 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $14.8 million in fiscal 2020.
results of operations - consolidated income before income taxes pre-tax income was $5.4 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to $3.0 billion in fiscal 2020. the increase was primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income generated by our homebuilding operations as a result of higher revenues from increased home closings and an increase in home sales gross margin. in fiscal 2021, our homebuilding, financial services, forestar and rental businesses generated pre-tax income of $4.8 billion, $364.6 million, $146.6 million and $86.5 million, respectively, compared to $2.7 billion, $245.2 million, $78.1 million and $39.8 million, respectively, in fiscal 2020.
income taxes our income tax expense was $1.2 billion and $602.5 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, and our effective tax rate was 21.8% and 20.2% in those years. the effective tax rates in fiscal 2021 and 2020 include an expense for state income taxes, tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and a reduction of 2.2% and 3.1%, respectively, for tax benefits related to the federal energy efficient homes tax credit. our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 also includes a reduction of 0.4% for a tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance against our state deferred tax assets.
our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, were $159.5 million at september 30, 2021 compared to $152.4 million at september 30, 2020. we have a valuation allowance of $4.2 million and $7.5 million at september 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to state deferred tax assets for net operating loss (nol) carryforwards that are more likely than not to expire before being realized. we will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to our remaining state nol carryforwards. any reversal of the valuation allowance in future periods will impact our effective tax rate.
d.r. horton has $10.3 million of tax benefits for state nol carryforwards that expire at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction. of the total amount, $2.9 million of the tax benefits expire over the next ten years and the remaining $7.4 million expire from fiscal years 2032 to 2041. forestar has $1.4 million of tax benefits for state nol carryforwards that expire at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction.
the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. also, changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax assets.
unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized in our financial statements. our unrecognized tax benefits totaled $2.9 million and $8.9 million at september 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
d.r. horton is subject to federal income tax and state income tax in multiple jurisdictions. the statute of limitations for d.r. horton's major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal years 2018 through 2021. a federal refund claim related to the retroactive extension of energy efficient homes tax credits for fiscal year 2018 is currently under audit by the internal revenue service. d.r. horton is under audit by various states, however, we are not aware of any significant findings by the state taxing authorities.
forestar is subject to federal income tax and state income tax in multiple jurisdictions. the statute of limitations for forestar's major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for tax years 2016 through 2021. forestar is not currently under audit for federal or state income taxes.
capital resources and liquidity we have historically funded our operations with cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities. our current levels of cash, borrowing capacity and balance sheet leverage provide us with the operational flexibility to adjust to changes in economic and market conditions.
during fiscal 2021 and currently, we have and continue to increase our investments in homebuilding inventories and single-family and multi-family rental properties to expand our operations and grow our revenues and profitability, as well as consider opportunistic strategic investments as they may arise. we are also returning capital to our shareholders through dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock. in the last two fiscal years, we have maintained higher homebuilding cash balances than in prior years to support the increased scale and level of activity in our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing conditions and opportunities.
at september 30, 2021, our ratio of debt to total capital (notes payable divided by stockholders' equity plus notes payable) was 26.7% compared to 26.6% at september 30, 2020. our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital (homebuilding notes payable divided by stockholders' equity plus homebuilding notes payable) was 17.8% compared to 17.5% at september 30, 2020. over the long term, we intend to maintain our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital below 30%, and we expect it to remain significantly lower than 30% throughout fiscal 2022. we believe that the ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing our capital structure with other homebuilders. we exclude the debt of forestar and our financial services business because they are separately capitalized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities.
as of september 30, 2021, we had outstanding notes payable with varying maturities totaling an aggregate principal amount of $5.4 billion, with $1.9 billion payable within 12 months. future interest payments associated with the notes total $451.4 million, with $156.4 million payable within 12 months.
at september 30, 2021, we had outstanding letters of credit of $247.4 million and surety bonds of $2.3 billion, issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts. we expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms. when we complete our performance obligations, the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter, leaving us with no continuing obligations. we have no material third-party guarantees.
we regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business, repay debt obligations, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock and maintain sufficient cash levels to support our other operational needs, and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital. d.r. horton has an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in july 2021, registering debt and equity securities that may be issued from time to time in amounts to be determined. forestar also has an effective shelf registration statement filed with the sec in september 2018, registering $500 million of equity securities. at september 30, 2021, $359.9 million remained available under forestar's shelf registration statement, of which $65.6 million was reserved for sales under its at-the-market equity offering program. in october 2021, after the expiration of forestar's existing registration statement and at-the-market equity offering program, a new shelf registration statement became effective, registering $750 million of equity securities. forestar anticipates entering into a new at-the-market equity offering program under this new registration statement. as market conditions permit, we may issue new debt or equity securities through the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity. we believe that our existing cash resources, revolving credit facilities, mortgage repurchase facility and ability to access the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our near-term working capital needs and debt obligations.

the forestar revolving credit facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and financial covenants. the financial covenants require forestar to maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth, a minimum level of liquidity and a maximum allowable leverage ratio. these covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility and are reported to the lenders quarterly. a failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity.

all of the homebuilding senior notes and the homebuilding revolving credit facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by certain subsidiaries of d.r. horton, inc.

a court could void or subordinate any guarantor's guarantee under the fraudulent conveyance laws if existing or future creditors of any such guarantor were successful in establishing that: (i) such guarantee was incurred with fraudulent intent; or (ii) such guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for issuing its guarantee and was insolvent at the time of the guarantee, was rendered insolvent by reason of the guarantee, was engaged in a business or transaction for which its assets constituted unreasonably small capital to carry on its business, or intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debt beyond its ability to pay such debt as it matured.
the measures of insolvency for purposes of determining whether a fraudulent conveyance occurred would vary depending upon the laws of the relevant jurisdiction and upon the valuation assumptions and methodology applied by the court. generally, however, a company would be considered insolvent for purposes of the foregoing if the sum of the company's debts, including contingent, unliquidated and unmatured liabilities, is greater than all of such company's property at a fair valuation, or if the present fair saleable value of the company's assets is less than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts as they become absolute and matured.
the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes contain a "savings clause," which limits the liability of each guarantor on its guarantee to the maximum amount that such guarantor can incur without risk that its guarantee will be subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer. this provision may not be effective to protect such guarantees from fraudulent transfer challenges or, if it does, it may reduce such guarantor's obligation such that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would not suffice, if necessary, to pay the notes in full when due.
on the basis of historical financial information, operating history and other factors, we believe that each of the guarantors, after giving effect to the issuance of the guarantees when such guarantees were issued, was not insolvent, did not have unreasonably small capital for the business in which it engaged and did not and has not incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature. we cannot assure you, however, as to what standard a court would apply in making these determinations or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard.
seasonality although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future, we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and pre-tax income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. the seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in the working capital requirements for our homebuilding, lot development, financial services and rental operations. as a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year.

critical accounting policies and estimates general - a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of d.r. horton, inc. and subsidiaries is presented in note a to the accompanying financial statements as of september 30, 2021 and 2020, and for the years ended september 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019. each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). in instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under gaap, we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business, the results of our operations and our financial condition, and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements. the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected.
we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition - we generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. our performance obligation, to deliver the agreed-upon home, is generally satisfied in less than one year from the original contract date. proceeds from home closings held for our benefit at title companies are included in homebuilding cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets.
when we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers, or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes, upgrades or options related to their homes, we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are cancelled. we either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on cancelled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances.
forestar's land and lot sales revenue and related profit are generally recognized at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to a third-party buyer. forestar's revenues from land and lot sales to d.r. horton are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
we rarely purchase unimproved land for resale, but periodically may elect to sell parcels of land that no longer fit into our strategic operating plans. revenue from land sales is typically recognized on the closing date, which is generally when performance obligations are satisfied.
we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued, both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed. revenues associated with our mortgage operations primarily include net gains on the sale of mortgage loans and servicing rights. we typically elect the fair value option for our mortgage loan originations whereby mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and loan values are adjusted through revenues for subsequent changes in fair value until the loans are sold. expected gains and losses from the sale of servicing rights are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through revenues at the time of commitment. we sell substantially all of the mortgages we originate and the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers. interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold.
mortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions, which can result in repurchases of loans previously sold to investors or payments to reimburse investors for loan losses. based on historical experience, analysis of the volume of mortgages we originated, discussions with our mortgage purchasers and current housing and credit market conditions, we estimate and record a loss reserve for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale, as well as known and projected mortgage loan repurchase requests.
inventories and cost of sales - inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition, land development and construction, capitalized interest, real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and construction. costs that we incur after projects or homes are substantially complete, such as utilities, maintenance, and cleaning, are charged to sg&a expense as incurred. all indirect overhead costs, such as compensation of sales personnel, division and region management, and the costs of advertising and builder's risk insurance are charged to sg&a expense as incurred.
land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a pro-rata basis, and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins. home construction costs are specifically identified and recorded to individual homes. cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) allocated to each residential lot based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community. cost of sales for lots sold includes all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) allocated to each residential lot in the community. any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home or lot closings in a community are generally allocated on a pro-rata basis to the remaining homes or lots in the community associated with the relevant development activity.
when a home is closed, we generally have not paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home. we record a liability and a corresponding charge to cost of sales for the amount estimated to ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed. we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home. we monitor the accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amounts previously accrued. although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals, such differences have not been significant.
at the end of each quarter, we review the performance and outlook for all of our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment. we generally review our inventory for impairment indicators at the community level, and the inventory within each community is categorized as land held for development, residential land and lots developed and under development, land held for sale, rental properties and construction in progress and finished homes, based on the stage of production or plans for future development or sale. a particular community often includes inventory in more than one category. in certain situations, inventory may be analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product type or future plans. in reviewing each of our communities, we determine if impairment indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the following:
•gross margins on homes closed in recent months;
•projected gross margins on homes sold but not closed;
•projected gross margins based on community budgets;
•projected gross margins of rental property sales;
•trends in gross margins, average selling prices or cost of sales;
•sales absorption rates; and
•performance of other communities in nearby locations.
if indicators of impairment are present for a community, we perform an impairment evaluation of the community, which includes an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. if so, impairment charges are recorded to cost of sales if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts. these estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community specific factors including estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land development, materials and labor costs which, in turn, may be impacted by the following local market conditions:
•supply and availability of new and existing homes;
•location and desirability of our communities;
•variety of product types offered in the area;
•pricing and use of incentives by us and our competitors;
•alternative uses for our land or communities such as the sale of land, finished lots or home sites to third parties;
•amount of land and lots we own or control in a particular market or sub-market; and
•local economic and demographic trends.
for those assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. when an impairment charge for a community is determined, the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot. impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed communities and completed rental properties when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values less estimated costs to sell these homes.
we rarely purchase land for resale. however, when we own land or communities under development that do not fit into our development and construction plans, and we determine that we will sell the asset, the project is accounted for as land held for sale if certain criteria are met. we record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell. in performing the impairment evaluation for land held for sale, we consider several factors including, but not limited to, recent offers received to purchase the property, prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions and market analysis studies, which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land. if the estimated fair value less costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell.
the key assumptions relating to inventory valuations are impacted by local market and economic conditions, and are inherently uncertain. although our quarterly assessments reflect management's best estimates, due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual results could differ from such estimates.
warranty claims - we typically provide our homebuyers with a ten-year limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems, a two-year limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a one-year limited warranty on other construction components. since we subcontract our construction work to subcontractors who typically provide us with an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work, claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of the subcontractors. warranty liabilities have been established by charging cost of sales for each home delivered. the amounts charged are based on management's estimate of expected warranty-related costs under all unexpired warranty obligation periods. our warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and is adjusted to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them. actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts. a 10% change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual. for additional information regarding our warranty liability, see note l, "commitments and contingencies," to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
legal claims and insurance - we are named as a defendant in various claims, complaints and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business. at any point in time, we are managing several hundred individual claims related to construction defect matters, personal injury claims, employment matters, land development issues, contract disputes and other matters. we have established reserves for these contingencies based on the estimated costs of pending claims and the estimated costs of anticipated future claims related to previously closed homes. approximately 99% of these reserves related to construction defect matters at both september 30, 2021 and 2020.
our reserves for construction defect claims include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future claims. at september 30, 2021 and 2020, we had reserves for approximately 380 and 260 pending construction defect claims, respectively, and no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements. during fiscal 2021, we were notified of approximately 235 new construction defect claims and resolved 115 construction defect claims for a total cost of $16.5 million. we have closed a significant number of homes during recent years, and we may be subject to future construction defect claims on these homes. although regulations vary from state to state, construction defect issues can generally be reported for up to ten years after the home has closed in many states in which we operate. historical data and trends regarding the frequency of claims incurred and the costs to resolve claims relative to the types of products and markets where we operate are used to estimate the construction defect liabilities for both existing and anticipated future claims. these estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data and trends change. adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the accounting period in which the change in estimate occurs.
historical trends in construction defect claims have been inconsistent, and we believe they may continue to fluctuate. we also believe that fluctuations in housing market conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims. if the ultimate resolution of construction defect claims resulting from our home closings in prior years varies from current expectations, it could significantly change our estimates regarding the frequency and timing of claims incurred and the costs to resolve existing and anticipated future claims, which would impact the construction defect reserves in the future. if the frequency of claims incurred or costs of existing and future legal claims significantly exceed our current estimates, they will have a significant negative impact on our future earnings and liquidity.
we estimate and record receivables under the applicable insurance policies related to our estimated contingencies for known claims and anticipated future construction defect claims on previously closed homes and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business when recovery is probable. however, because the self-insured retentions under these policies are significant, we anticipate we will largely be self-insured. additionally, we may have the ability to recover a portion of our losses from our subcontractors and their insurance carriers when we have been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies.
the estimation of losses related to these reserves and the related estimates of recoveries from insurance policies are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products built, claim frequency, claim settlement costs and patterns, insurance industry practices and legal interpretations, among others. due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing reserves for these contingencies, actual future costs and recoveries from insurance could differ significantly from current estimated amounts. a 10% increase in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim used to estimate the reserves would result in an increase of approximately $101.7 million in our reserves and a $50.9 million increase in our receivable, resulting in additional expense of $50.8 million. a 10% decrease in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim would result in a decrease of approximately $91.8 million in our reserves and a $43.8 million decrease in our receivable, resulting in a reduction in expense of $48.0 million. for additional information regarding our legal claims reserves, see note l, "commitments and contingencies," to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
pending accounting pronouncements in december 2019, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued asu 2019-12 related to simplifying the accounting for income taxes. the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1, 2021 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
in march 2020, the fasb issued asu 2020-04, "reference rate reform," which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying u.s. gaap to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of the london interbank offered rate (libor) or by another reference rate expected to be discontinued. the guidance was effective beginning march 12, 2020 and can be applied prospectively through december 31, 2022. in january 2021, the fasb issued asu 2021-01, "reference rate reform - scope," which clarified the scope and application of the original guidance. we will adopt these standards when libor is discontinued and do not expect them to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.
in october 2021, the fasb issued asu 2021-08, which requires application of asc 606, "revenue from contracts with customers," to recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities from contracts with customers acquired in a business combination. asu 2021-08 creates an exception to the general recognition and measurement principle in asc 805 and will result in recognition of contract assets and contract liabilities consistent with those recorded by the acquiree immediately before the acquisition date. the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1, 2023 and interim periods therein, with early adoption permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

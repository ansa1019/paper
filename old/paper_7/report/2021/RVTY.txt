overview of fiscal year 2021
during fiscal year 2021, we continued to see strong returns from our acquisitions as well as our organic investments across technology, marketing and people. our overall revenue in fiscal year 2021 increased $1,284.4 million, or 34%, as compared to fiscal year 2020, reflecting an increase of $865.0 million, or 42%, in our diagnostics segment revenue and an increase of $419.4 million, or 24%, in our discovery & analytical solutions segment revenue. revenue from our 2021 acquisitions contributed $219.7 million to the increase in our overall revenue during fiscal year 2021. the increase in our diagnostics segment revenue during fiscal year 2021 was primarily driven by increased demand for our covid-19 product offerings resulting in an increase of $749.0 million in our immunodiagnostics revenue. our diagnostics segment revenue also increased during fiscal year 2021 due to growth in our core product offerings resulting in an increase of $61.9 million in our reproductive health revenue and an increase of $54.2 million in our applied genomics revenue. revenue from our 2021 acquisitions contributed $95.5 million to the increase in our diagnostics segment revenue during fiscal year 2021. the increase in our discovery & analytical solutions segment revenue during fiscal year 2021 was driven by an increase of $305.1 million in our life sciences market revenue and an increase of $114.3 million in our applied markets revenue. revenue from our 2021 acquisitions contributed $124.3 million to the increase in our discovery & analytical solutions segment revenue during fiscal year 2021.
in our diagnostics segment, we experienced tremendous demand for our immunodiagnostics covid-19 product offerings, particularly in the americas, partially offset by a decline in demand for these product offerings in the asia-pacific region. we also experienced strong growth in our immunodiagnostics and applied genomics core product and service offerings across all regions. in our reproductive health business, an expanded range of product offerings and increased geographic reach more than offset the impact of declining birthrates.
in our discovery & analytical solutions segment, the increase in our life sciences market revenue was the result of an increase in revenue in our pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets, as well as an increase in revenue from our informatics business. the increase in our applied markets revenue was driven by increased demand from our industrial, environmental and food markets.
our consolidated gross margins increased 49 basis points in fiscal year 2021, as compared to fiscal year 2020, primarily due to higher sales volume, a favorable shift in product mix and continued productivity initiatives to improve our supply chain, partially offset by increased amortization expense. our consolidated operating margin increased 42 basis points in fiscal year 2021, as compared to fiscal year 2020, primarily due to higher sales volume leverage and increased sales of our covid-19 products offerings, which were partially offset by increased amortization of intangible assets, investments in new product development and growth initiatives.
overall, we believe that our strategic priorities and recent portfolio transformations, coupled with our expanded range of product offerings, leading market positions, global scale and financial strength provides us with a foundation for continued revenue growth, strong margins and cash flows, and long-term earnings per share growth.

revenue revenue for fiscal year 2021 was $5.1 billion, as compared to $3.8 billion for fiscal year 2020, an increase of $1.3 billion, or 34%, which includes an approximate 8% increase in revenue attributable to acquisitions and divestitures, and a 1% increase in revenue attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. revenue from our 2021 acquisitions contributed $219.7 million to the increase in our overall revenue during fiscal year 2021. the analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment revenue for fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and acquisitions and divestitures. the total increase in revenue reflects an increase in our diagnostics segment revenue of $865.0 million, or 42%, due to increased demand for our covid-19 product offerings resulting in an increase of $749.0 million in our immunodiagnostics revenue. our diagnostics segment revenue also increased during fiscal year 2021 due to growth in our core product offerings resulting in an increase of $61.9 million in our reproductive health revenue and an increase of $54.2 million in our applied genomics revenue. our discovery & analytical solutions segment revenue increased by $419.4 million, or 24%, due to an increase of $305.1 million from our life sciences market revenue and an increase of $114.3 million from our applied markets revenue. as a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize $0.8 million of revenue primarily related to our diagnostics segment for each of fiscal years 2021 and 2020 and $1.8 million and $0.3 million of revenue primarily related to our discovery & analytical solutions segment in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods.
cost of revenue cost of revenue for fiscal year 2021 was $2.2 billion, as compared to $1.7 billion for fiscal year 2020, an increase of approximately $543.0 million, or 32%. as a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue decreased to 43.7% in fiscal year 2021 from 44.2% in fiscal year 2020, resulting in an increase in gross margin of approximately 49 basis points to 56.3% in fiscal year 2021 from 55.8% in fiscal year 2020. amortization of intangible assets increased and was $115.1 million for fiscal year 2021, as compared to $65.3 million for fiscal year 2020. amortization of intangible assets from our 2021 acquisitions amounted to $34.0 million. the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions added an incremental expense of $35.2 million for fiscal year 2021, as compared to $2.8 million for fiscal year 2020. other purchase accounting adjustments added an incremental expense of $1.8 million for fiscal year 2021, of which $1.6 million was acquisition-related stock compensation and $0.2 million was increased depreciation on property, plant and equipment. asset impairment was $7.9 million for fiscal year 2020. in addition to the factors noted above, the overall increase in gross margin was primarily the result of higher sales volume, a favorable shift in product mix and continued productivity initiatives to improve our supply chain, partially offset by increased amortization expense.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2021 were $1,227.5 million, as compared to $917.9 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of approximately $309.6 million, or 33.7%. as a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 24.2% in fiscal year 2021 from 24.3% in fiscal year 2020. amortization of intangible assets increased to $175.1 million for fiscal year 2021, as compared to $127.3 million for fiscal year 2020. amortization of intangible assets from our 2021 acquisitions amounted to $37.2 million. acquisition and divestiture-related expenses added an incremental expense of $83.4 million for fiscal year 2021, of which $3.9 million was acquisition-related stock compensation, as compared to acquisition and divestiture-related expenses increasing expenses by $8.7 million for fiscal year 2020. purchase accounting adjustments added an incremental expense of $3.2 million for fiscal year 2021, of which $3.1 million was change in contingent consideration and $0.1 million was increased depreciation on property, plant and equipment, as compared to purchase accounting adjustments decreasing expenses by $8.8 million for fiscal year 2020, which was attributable to change in contingent consideration. asset impairment costs added an incremental expense of $3.9 million for fiscal year 2021. legal costs for significant litigation matters and settlements were $0.1 million for fiscal year 2021, as compared to $7.1 million for fiscal year 2020. costs for significant environmental matters were $5.2 million for fiscal year 2020. in addition to the above items, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of costs related to investments in people, digital capabilities and innovation, and recent acquisitions amplified by pandemic-related cost controls and disruptions in the prior year.
research and development expenses research and development expenses for fiscal year 2021 were $275.0 million, as compared to $205.4 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of $69.6 million, or 33.9%. research and development expenses from our 2021 acquisitions were $25.4
table of contents million. as a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses were flat at 5.4% in each of fiscal years 2021 and 2020. stock compensation related to our acquisitions added an incremental expense of $1.4 million in fiscal year 2021. purchase accounting adjustments for depreciation on property, plant and equipment added an incremental expense of $0.1 million in fiscal year 2021. the increase in research and development expenses was driven by our investments in new product development.
restructuring and other costs, net we have undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, the alignment of our operations with our growth strategy and the integration of our business units and productivity initiatives. restructuring and other costs, net were $16.4 million for fiscal year 2021 as compared to $8.0 million for fiscal year 2020.

the decrease of $19.7 million in interest and other expense, net, in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was largely due to a net pension credit of $39.8 million in fiscal year 2021 as compared to a net pension cost of $18.8 million in fiscal year 2020, a decrease in other expense, net of $1.4 million and a change in fair value of financial securities of $11.0 million, partially offset by an increase of $52.4 million in interest expense in fiscal year 2021. the increase of $52.4 million in interest expense in fiscal year 2021 was the result of $23.4 million of costs of bridge financing and debt pre-issuance hedges that were recognized in fiscal year 2021 and interest expense from new debt in fiscal year 2021. a more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading "liquidity and capital resources."
provision for income taxes the effective tax rates on continuing operations were 26.3% and 19.7% for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. certain of our subsidiaries have, at various times, been granted tax relief in their respective countries, resulting in lower income taxes than would otherwise be the case under ordinary tax rates. a reconciliation of income tax expense at the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate to the recorded tax provision is as follows for the fiscal years ended:

the variation in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 is primarily affected by the recognition of $37.1 million in u.s. federal, u.s. state and non-u.s. taxes due when we repatriate foreign earnings that we no longer consider indefinitely reinvested. we also recognized $19.0 million in fiscal year 2021 and $21.8 million in fiscal year 2020 of benefits derived from tax holidays in china and singapore. the effect of these benefits, derived from tax holidays, on basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2021 was $0.16 and $0.16, respectively, and for fiscal year 2020 was $0.20 and $0.19, respectively. the tax holiday in china is renewed every three years. we expect to renew the tax holiday for two of our subsidiaries in china that expired in fiscal year 2021. the tax holiday for one of our subsidiaries in singapore is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2023.

liquidity and capital resources we require cash to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures, make strategic acquisitions, service our debt and other long-term liabilities, repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends on our common stock. our principal sources of funds are cash flows from our operations, borrowing capacity available under our senior unsecured credit facility and access to the debt markets. we anticipate that our internal operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, smaller acquisitions, interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock. however, we expect to use external sources to satisfy the balance of our debt when due, any larger acquisitions and other long-term liabilities, such as contributions to our postretirement benefit plans.
we and our subsidiaries and affiliates may from time to time, in our sole discretion, purchase, repay, redeem or retire any of our outstanding debt securities (including any publicly issued debt securities), in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise, or extend or refinance any of our outstanding indebtedness.
principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include:
•changes in sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services, and
•changes in our working capital requirements.
principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include:
•financial covenants contained in the financial instruments controlling our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity,
•increases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt,
•a ratings downgrade that could limit the amount we can borrow under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market,
•increases in interest rates or credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit, that affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis,
•a decrease in the market price for our common stock, and
•volatility in the public debt and equity markets.

financing activities. net cash provided by the financing activities of our continuing operations was $2,941.7 million for fiscal year 2021, as compared to net cash used in the financing activities of our continuing operations of $202.9 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of $3,144.5 million in net cash used in financing activities. the cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2021 was a result of proceeds from the sale of unsecured senior notes, proceeds from borrowings, proceeds from a term loan and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under stock plans. during fiscal year 2021, proceeds from the sale of unsecured senior notes were $3,086.1 million, our proceeds from debt borrowings totaled $1,400.3 million and proceeds from a term loan were $500.0 million. these were partially offset by payments on borrowings of $1,559.1 million, payments of senior unsecured notes of $339.6 million and debt issuance costs of $31.0 million during fiscal year 2021. this compares to debt borrowings of $714.7 million, which were more than offset by debt payments of $897.7 million during fiscal year 2021. proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans were $25.1 million during fiscal year 2021, as compared to $37.7 million for fiscal year 2020. this cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2021 was partially offset by repurchases of our common stock, payments of dividends, net payments on other credit facilities settlement of swap and settlement of cash flow hedges. during fiscal year 2021, we repurchased 433,000 shares of common stock under the repurchase program and 71,248 shares of our common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans and to satisfy obligations related to the exercise of stock options made pursuant to our equity incentive plans, for a total cost of $73.1 million. this compares to repurchases of 72,251 shares of our common stock pursuant to our equity incentive plans in fiscal year 2020, for a total cost of $6.9 million. during fiscal year 2021, we paid $32.4 million in dividends as compared to $31.2 million for fiscal year 2020. during fiscal year 2021, we paid $14.3 million for settlement of a swap. during fiscal year 2021, we had net payments on other credit facilities of $13.7 million as compared to $4.5 million for fiscal year 2020. we paid $4.5 million in settlement of hedges during fiscal year 2021 as compared to $4.6 million for fiscal year 2020. during fiscal year 2021, we paid $2.2 million for acquisition-related contingent consideration as compared to $10.4 million in fiscal year 2020.
fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019
for a discussion of our results of operations for fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019, see item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended january 3, 2021 filed with the securities and exchange commission on march 2, 2021.
borrowing arrangements see note 13, debt, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our borrowing arrangements.
dividends our board of directors (our "board") declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share in each quarter of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, resulting in an annual dividend rate of $0.28 per share. at january 2, 2022, we had accrued $8.8 million for a dividend declared in october 2021 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 that was paid in february 2022. on january 27, 2022, we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 that will be payable in may 2022. in the future, our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.
table of contents capital expenditures during fiscal year 2022, we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year 2021, primarily to introduce new products, to improve our operating processes, to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations, and to develop information technology. we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures.
other potential liquidity considerations at january 2, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $618.3 million, of which $526.3 million was held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries, and we had $1.5 billion of additional borrowing capacity available under a senior unsecured revolving credit facility. we had no other liquid investments at january 2, 2022.
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. we use our non-u.s. cash for needs outside of the u.s. including foreign operations, capital investments, acquisitions and repayment of debt. in addition, we also transfer cash to the u.s. using nontaxable returns of capital, distributions of previously taxed income, as well as dividends, where the related income tax cost is managed efficiently.
prior to enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "tax act"), we did not provide deferred income tax expense on the cumulative undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries. at december 31, 2017, we accrued for a one-time transition tax expense of $85.0 million on our unremitted foreign earnings in accordance with the tax act. the u.s. treasury subsequently issued regulations on the tax act and we recorded tax expense (benefit) of $2.7 million and $(4.6) million during fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. we continue to make our scheduled tax payments associated with this one-time transition tax expense accrual.
as of january 2, 2022, we evaluated our undistributed foreign earnings and identified approximately $1.2 billion in earnings that we no longer considered indefinitely reinvested. we intend to begin repatriating such earnings to the u.s., in whole or in part, during fiscal year 2022. in doing so, we have recorded a provision of approximately $37.1 million for the u.s. federal, u.s. state and non-u.s. taxes that would fall due when such earnings are repatriated. no additional income tax expense has been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings, or any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested.
on july 31, 2020, our board authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate amount up to $250.0 million under a stock repurchase program (the "repurchase program"). the repurchase program will expire on july 27, 2022 unless terminated earlier by our board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. during fiscal year 2021, we repurchased 433,000 shares of common stock under the repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $62.6 million. as of january 2, 2022, $187.4 million remained available for aggregate repurchases of shares under the repurchase program.
in addition, our board has authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans and to satisfy obligations related to the exercise of stock options made pursuant to our equity incentive plans. during fiscal year 2021, we repurchased 71,248 shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of $10.5 million. during fiscal year 2020, we repurchased 72,251 shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of $6.9 million.
the repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value. any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs. if we continue to repurchase shares, the repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources, including cash and cash equivalents, and our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
as of january 2, 2022, we may have to pay contingent consideration, related to acquisitions with open contingency periods, of up to $108.4 million. as of january 2, 2022, we have recorded contingent consideration obligations of $58.0 million, of which $1.3 million was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and $56.7 million was recorded in long-term liabilities. the expected maximum earnout period for acquisitions with open contingency periods does not exceed 6.9 years from january 2, 2022, and the remaining weighted average expected earnout period at january 2, 2022 was 5.4 years.
distressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability, creating increased volatility in security prices, widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments. the widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold. increases in credit spreads, as well as limitations on the table of contents availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable, could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. in difficult global financial markets, we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities.
our pension plans have not experienced a material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets. with respect to plans outside of the united states, we expect to contribute $7.0 million in the aggregate during fiscal year 2022. during fiscal years 2021 and 2020, we contributed $6.9 million and $7.5 million, in the aggregate, to pension plans outside of the united states, respectively. during fiscal year 2021, we contributed $20.0 million to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states for the plan year 2019. we could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods for all pension plans. we expect to use existing cash and external sources to satisfy future contributions to our pension plans.
we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations, and are subject to various claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable, in our opinion, based on our review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these contingencies at january 2, 2022 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k. however, each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us. see "business-environmental matters" above and note 16, contingencies, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these matters and proceedings.
effects of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements see note 1, nature of operations and accounting policies, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements.
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to accounting for business combinations, long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles and employee compensation and benefits. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
business combinations. business combinations are accounted for at fair value. acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses; restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense. measurement period adjustments are made in the period in which the amounts are determined and the current period income effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date. all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are also included in current period earnings. the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. for intangible assets, we normally utilize the "income method" which incorporates the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows attributable to the subject intangible asset, adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. depending on the asset valued, the key assumptions included one or more of the following: (1) future revenue growth rates, (2) future gross margin, (3) future selling, general and administrative expenses, (4) royalty rates, (5) customer attrition rates, and (6) discount rates. if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets, or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed. the fair value of contingent consideration is remeasured each period based on relevant information and changes to the fair value are included in the operating results for the period.
table of contents value of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles. we carry a variety of long-lived assets on our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment, operating lease right of use assets, investments, identifiable intangible assets, and goodwill. we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based, in part, upon current estimates of fair values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows. we undertake this review (i) on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets and (ii) on a periodic basis for other long-lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished. any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings.
for goodwill, the test consists of the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized up to the amount of goodwill. we perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of january 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered. we completed the annual goodwill impairment test using a measurement date of january 4, 2021, and concluded that there was no goodwill impairment. at january 4, 2021, the fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than 20.0% for each reporting unit, except for our tulip reporting unit, which had a fair value that was between 10% and 20% more than its carrying value. the range of the long-term terminal growth rates for the reporting units was 3.0% to 5.0% for the fiscal year 2021 impairment analysis. the range for the discount rates for the reporting units was 8.0% to 12.5%. keeping all other variables constant, a 10.0% change in any one of these input assumptions for the various reporting units, except for our tulip reporting unit, would still allow us to conclude that there was no impairment of goodwill. at january 2, 2022, the operating performance of our tulip reporting unit exceeded the original forecast and the forecast for this reporting unit no longer indicates any sensitivity that would lead to a material impairment charge.
we consistently employ the income approach to estimate the current fair value when testing for impairment of goodwill. a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the income approach to forecast operating cash flows, including markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce, tax rates, capital spending, discount rates and working capital changes. cash flow forecasts are based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years' cash flows and historical relationships in later years. the income approach is sensitive to changes in long-term terminal growth rates and the discount rates. the long-term terminal growth rates are consistent with our historical long-term terminal growth rates, as the current economic trends are not expected to affect our long-term terminal growth rates. we corroborate the income approach with a market approach. while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable, if actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used including such items as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve, impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets could be required in the future.
employee compensation and benefits. we sponsor both funded and unfunded u.s. and non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits. retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business, and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future, and therefore are subject to estimation. retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses, in our consolidated statements of operations. we immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur. actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of the calendar month-end that is closest to our fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter, unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement.
we recognized a gain of $30.9 million in fiscal year 2021 and a loss of $18.0 million in fiscal year 2020, for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans, which include the charge or benefit for the mark-to-market adjustment for the benefit plans, which was recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. the loss or income related to the mark-to-market adjustment on benefit plans was a pre-tax gain of $24.7 million in fiscal year 2021 and a pre-tax loss of $25.4 million in fiscal year 2020. we expect income of approximately $5.4 million in fiscal year 2022 for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans, excluding the charge for or benefit from the mark-to-market adjustment. it is difficult to reliably calculate and predict whether there will be a mark-to-market adjustment in fiscal year 2022. mark-to-market adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control, including changes in interest rates, the performance of the financial markets and mortality assumptions. to the extent the discount rates decrease or the value of our pension and postretirement investments decrease, mark-to market charges to operations will be recorded in fiscal year 2022. conversely, to the extent the discount rates increase or the value of our pension and postretirement investments increase more than expected, mark-to market income will be recorded in fiscal year 2022. pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee's approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made. we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long-term rate of return on assets, the discount rate applied and mortality assumptions, to determine service cost and interest cost, in order to arrive at expected pension income or expense for the year. we use discount rates for each individual plan based upon the expected cash flows using the applicable spot rates derived from a yield curve over the projected cash flow period.
table of contents if any of our assumptions were to change as of january 2, 2022, our pension plan expenses would also change as follows:

item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year in review in late february 2020, the company began to see a negative impact from the covid-19 pandemic, which quickly accelerated during first quarter 2020 and continued throughout 2021. while the pandemic has continued to negatively impact results, the company saw steady improvement as the year progressed, with intermittent periods of decelerated demand that coincided with covid-19 surges. the company's financial results in both years, on both a gaap and non-gaap basis, were significantly impacted by the pandemic and the resulting effect on demand and passenger bookings.
the company recorded gaap and non-gaap results for 2021 and 2020 as noted in the following tables. see note regarding use of non-gaap financial measures and the reconciliation of reported amounts to non-gaap financial measures for additional detail regarding non-gaap financial measures.

the significant improvement in both gaap net income (loss) and operating income (loss), year-over-year, was primarily due to the rebound in domestic leisure demand and bookings in 2021 as impacts from the covid-19 pandemic eased. this resulted in a 74.5 percent increase in operating revenues in 2021 versus 2020, although 2021 operating revenues were still well below 2019 levels. further, the company received $2.7 billion in grant allocations of payroll funding support ("payroll support") from the united states department of treasury ("treasury") in 2021, compared with $2.3 billion received in 2020, which the company utilized in both years to offset a portion of salaries, wages, and benefits. see below and note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
on a quarterly basis, demand for air travel improved each period of 2021. although the company's gaap financial results benefited from the impact of payroll support recognized during the first three quarters of the year, the company was able to generate a profit during fourth quarter 2021 despite having no further allocation of payroll support.
operating statistics the company provides the operating data below for the three years ended december 31, 2021, because these statistics are commonly used in the airline industry and, therefore, allow readers to compare the company's performance against its results for prior periods, as well as against the performance of the company's peers.

(a) the company believes that operating revenues compared with 2019 is a more relevant measure of performance than a year-over-year comparison due to the significant impacts in 2021 due to the pandemic.
(b) operating expenses per available seat mile, excluding fuel and oil expense, profitsharing, and special items.
(c) aircraft on property, end of period; net of 6 and 28 retirements planned in first quarter 2022 and full year 2022, respectively. two aircraft originally planned for delivery in first quarter 2022 have shifted into the company's second quarter 2022 planned delivery schedule. reflects 12 options exercised through february 3, 2022, five and seven for delivery in first quarter and second quarter 2022, respectively, and the assumption that the company exercises all 30 remaining 2022 options. the delivery schedule for the boeing 737-7 (-7) is dependent on the federal aviation administration ("faa") issuing required certifications and approvals to the boeing company ("boeing") and the company. the faa will ultimately determine the timing of the -7 certification and entry into service, and the company therefore offers no assurances that current estimates and timelines are correct.
(d) represents current contractual payments to boeing for firm aircraft and the assumptions that the company exercises all 30 remaining 2022 options, in addition to ~$900 million non-aircraft capital spending. excluding any further option exercises in 2022, the company's 2022 capital spending would be ~$3.4 billion, also including ~$900 million in non-aircraft capital spending
(e) remains unchanged from previously reported estimation.
following strong travel demand during the fourth quarter 2021 holiday period, the company is experiencing a revenue headwind in first quarter 2022 due to a softness in bookings and an increase in trip cancellations associated with the omicron variant. january and february are seasonally weaker time periods for leisure travel demand, but further softness in leisure bookings related to the omicron variant, combined with lower than expected business travel demand, is estimated to reduce operating revenues in january and february 2022 by $330 million, combined. the company canceled more than 5,600 flights in january 2022, with the majority attributable to available staffing challenges as a result of the omicron variant, as well as weather-related cancellations, driving an estimated $50 million negative impact to january 2022 operating revenues. first quarter 2022 managed business revenues are expected to be down 45 percent to 55 percent versus first quarter 2019 levels. the company remains optimistic about the return of business travel demand in 2022 based on the momentum experienced in fourth quarter 2021 before the impact of the omicron variant. the company is also encouraged by recent improvements in booking trends, especially for march 2022, and current revenue trends for spring break travel appear to be in line with typical seasonal expectations.
based on current cost trends and reduced capacity plans, first quarter 2022 operating expenses, excluding fuel and oil expense, special items, and profitsharing, are expected to increase in the range of 20 percent to 24 percent on a unit basis as compared with first quarter 2019. the projection does not reflect the potential impact of fuel and oil expense, special items, and profitsharing expense because the company cannot reliably predict or estimate these items or expenses or their impact to the company's financial statements in future periods, especially considering the significant volatility of the fuel and oil expense line item. accordingly, the company believes a reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to the equivalent gaap financial measures for projected results is not meaningful or available without unreasonable effort. the company continues to experience cost pressure due to inflation in labor rates and airport costs, as well as unit cost headwinds from operating at suboptimal productivity levels. additionally, the company has temporarily extended incentive pay to its operations employees through early february 2022, which is expected to result in an additional $150 million of salaries, wages, and benefits expense in first quarter 2022, compared to the $100 million in incentive pay earned by employees during fourth quarter 2021. furthermore, the company is reducing its first quarter 2022 capacity to provide additional stability during this challenging environment.
with the omicron variant and weather impacting the company's results, the company expects losses in january and february and a return to profitability in march 2022. based on the company's current plan, while the company no longer expects to be profitable in first quarter, the company expects to be profitable for the remaining three quarters of this year, and for full year 2022.
covid-19 pandemic impacts in response to the far-reaching impacts of the covid-19 pandemic, the company took, and continues to assess and modify, measures to support the well-being of both its employees and passengers, including procedures and policies intended to maintain an elevated level of cleanliness on aircraft and at facilities, and mitigate the spread of the virus. the company also continues to monitor guidelines and recommendations from the centers for disease control and prevention applicable to the company's daily operations, and the manner in which the majority of the company's office and clerical employees work on a daily basis.
as detailed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in connection with the major negative impact of covid-19 on air carriers, the company has received significant financial assistance from treasury in the form of payroll support, and this assistance has had a significant impact on the company's reported gaap financial results in 2021. such impact ended in third quarter 2021, and the company's fourth quarter 2021 results do not reflect the benefit of this payroll support, and its future period results are not expected to benefit from such payroll support. however, future cash flows will be impacted through the portion of payroll support that was in the form of loans that will have to be repaid to treasury.
during second quarter 2020, the company introduced voluntary separation program 2020 ("voluntary separation program") and the extended emergency time off ("extended eto") program which helped closer align staffing to reduced flight schedules and enabled the company to avoid involuntary furloughs and layoffs associated with the impacts of the pandemic. approximately 16,000 employees elected to participate in one of these programs. during 2021, approximately 11,400 employees returned from the extended eto program and less than 250 employees remained on extended eto leave as of december 31, 2021. in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the company accrued a total charge of $1.4 billion in 2020 related to the special termination benefits for employees who had accepted the company's offer to participate in its voluntary separation program and the special benefits for employees who participated in its extended eto program. the accrual is being reduced as program benefits are paid or as it becomes no longer probable that employees will remain on leave for their elected terms. the company realized approximately $1.1 billion of full year 2021 cost savings from the voluntary separation program and extended eto compared with full year 2019, and expects no material cost savings from these programs in 2022 and beyond. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
the company continues to have a smaller workforce than it did prior to the covid-19 pandemic. however, in addition to recalling nearly all of the employees that participated in extended eto, the company met its 2021 hiring goals and is planning to add at least 8,000 additional employees during 2022 as it strives to provide sufficient staffing to support its anticipated flight schedule plans for 2022 and beyond. the company is making additional investments to attract and retain talent, including the recent decision to further raise the company's starting hourly pay rates from $15 per hour to $17 per hour for (i) southwest ramp, operations, provisioning, and freight agents, (ii) southwest customer service agents, customer representatives, and source of support representatives, (iii) southwest flight simulator technicians, and (iv) southwest aircraft appearance technicians. the company is currently in discussions with its workgroups to enact this increase in pay rates. the company continues to evaluate staffing needs to align with planned flight activity.
in september 2021, the president of the united states issued an executive order establishing a vaccination requirement for employees of covered federal contractors. the federal government required that federal contractors have their workforce vaccinated (or request an accommodation) by december 8, 2021. the deadline was later extended to january 4, 2022. the company started an active campaign to notify employees of the need to submit proof of covid-19 vaccination, or apply for an accommodation, by january 4, 2022. on december 3, 2021, the company announced that 93 percent of its employees were vaccinated, or had requested an accommodation. due to legal challenges to the vaccine mandate, the company announced on december 20, 2021, that it is no longer imposing a deadline for compliance. however, if the vaccine mandate is revived, the company will resume efforts to work with employees who have not yet either submitted proof of vaccination or requested an accommodation.
company overview the company has entered into supplemental agreements with the boeing company ("boeing") to increase aircraft orders and accelerate certain options with the goal of improving potential growth opportunities, restoring its network closer to pre-pandemic levels, lowering operating costs, and further modernizing its fleet with less carbon-intensive aircraft. during fourth quarter 2021, the company exercised 22 boeing 737 max 7 ("-7") options for delivery in 2023, and through february 3, 2022, the company has exercised another 24 boeing options- 12 -8 options for delivery in 2022, and 12 -7 options for delivery in 2023. the company's order book with boeing as of december 31, 2021, consists of a total of 394 max firm orders (264 -7 aircraft and 130 boeing 737 max-8 ("-8") aircraft) and 238 max options (-7s or -8s) for years 2022 through 2031. the company continues to expect that more than half of the max aircraft in its firm order book will replace a significant amount of its 452 boeing 737-700 ("-700") aircraft over the next 10 to 15 years to support the modernization of its fleet, a key cost initiative and component of its environmental sustainability efforts.
the company ended 2021 with 728 boeing 737 aircraft, including 69 -8 aircraft. during 2021, the company retired 8 owned -700 aircraft, which were accelerated from 2022 into fourth quarter 2021, and returned 10 leased -700 aircraft, of which one occurred during fourth quarter 2021. in addition, the company took delivery of 28 -8 aircraft during 2021. as of december 31, 2021, six -700 aircraft remained in temporary storage due to fourth quarter 2021 and first quarter 2022 capacity remaining below respective 2019 levels.
the company has published its flight schedule through september 5, 2022. during 2021, the company pursued additional revenue opportunities that utilize idle aircraft to provide service to new, popular destinations. the company is leveraging additional airports in or near cities where its customer base is large, along with adding easier access to popular leisure-oriented destinations from across its domestic-focused network. these additional service points on the company's route map are opportunities it can provide customers now, all while better positioning the company for a travel demand rebound. during 2021, the company began service to new destinations including:
•chicago o'hare international airport and sarasota bradenton international airport - february 14, 2021
•colorado springs municipal airport and savannah/hilton head international airport - march 11, 2021
•houston's george bush intercontinental airport and santa barbara airport - april 12, 2021
•fresno yosemite international airport - april 25, 2021
•destin-fort walton beach airport - may 6, 2021
•myrtle beach international airport - may 23, 2021
•bozeman yellowstone international airport - may 27, 2021
•jackson-medgar wiley evers international airport in mississippi - june 6, 2021
•eugene airport in oregon - august 29, 2021
•bellingham international airport in washington - november 7, 2021
•syracuse hancock international airport in new york - november 14, 2021
the covid-19 pandemic had a particularly negative impact on the company's international operations and led to the company's suspension of international operations at the beginning of the pandemic. the company has since resumed service to 13 of its 14 international destinations. the company's operations to the cayman islands are temporarily suspended due to impacts from the covid-19 pandemic, but with the easing of government restrictions and the continued increase in demand for beach and leisure destinations, the company intends to resume service to the cayman islands in 2022.
in 2021, the company announced goals to (i) achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, (ii) maintain carbon neutral growth (to 2019 levels) through the end of the decade, and (iii) reduce carbon emissions intensity per available seat mile (including scope 1 and scope 2 emissions) by at least 20 percent by 2030. the company also announced a series of actions and initiatives designed to assist the company in achieving these goals, including agreements with various third parties intended to facilitate the development, production, and usage of commercialized sustainable aviation fuel; the launch of a carbon-offset program that allows customers to contribute funds for the purchase of carbon offsets for southwest; and arrangements with nonprofit organizations seeking to address climate change and reduce carbon emissions in aviation.
as part of its commitment to corporate sustainability, the company has published the southwest one report describing the company's sustainability strategies, which include the company's fuel conservation and emissions reduction initiatives and other efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address other environmental matters such as energy and water conservation, waste minimization, and recycling. information contained in the southwest one report is not incorporated by reference into, and does not constitute a part of, this form 10-k. while the company believes that the disclosures contained in the southwest one report and other voluntary disclosures regarding environmental, social, and governance ("esg") matters are responsive to various areas of investor interest, the company believes that these disclosures do not currently address matters that are material in the near term to the company's operations, strategy, financial condition, or financial results, although this view may change in the future based on new information that could materially alter the estimates, assumptions, or timelines used to create these disclosures. given the estimates, assumptions and timelines used to create the southwest one report and other voluntary disclosures, the materiality of these disclosures is inherently difficult to assess in advance.
2021 compared with 2020
operating revenues passenger revenues for 2021 increased by $6.4 billion, or 83.5 percent, compared with 2020. on a unit basis, passenger revenues increased 43.9 percent, year-over-year. the increase in passenger revenues on both a dollar and unit basis were primarily due to the improvements in leisure passenger demand and bookings in 2021, compared with the severe decline in demand and bookings resulting from the covid-19 pandemic for the majority of 2020.
freight revenues for 2021 increased by $26 million, or 16.1 percent, compared with 2020, primarily due to increased demand for consumer goods.
other revenues for 2021 increased by $315 million, or 25.8 percent, compared with 2020. the increase was primarily due to an increase in income from business partners, including chase bank usa, n.a. ("chase"). the improving economy throughout 2021 and rebound in travel demand resulted in higher spend on the company's co-branded credit card, as well as additional revenues earned through the company's rental car and hotel partners.
operating expenses operating expenses for 2021 increased by $1.2 billion, or 9.4 percent, compared with 2020, while capacity increased 27.6 percent over the same period. historically, except for changes in the price of fuel, changes in operating expenses for airlines have been largely driven by changes in capacity, or asms. however, the company's operating expenses are largely fixed once flight schedules are published, and asm reductions as a result of flight schedule adjustments have a negative impact on operating expenses per asm. the following table presents the company's operating expenses per asm for 2021 and 2020, followed by explanations of these changes on a dollar basis. unless otherwise specified, changes on a per asm basis were driven by changes in capacity, which increased with the improvement of travel demand, causing the company's fixed costs to be spread over significantly more asms.

operating expenses per asm for 2021 decreased by 14.2 percent, compared with 2020. the year-over-year unit cost decrease in 2021 was enhanced by the increase in payroll support funding as such allocations are accounted for as a direct reduction to the company's operating expenses. this decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by an increase in both jet fuel prices and fuel gallons consumed, and $222 million of gains from the sale-leaseback of 20 aircraft to third parties in two separate transactions during second quarter 2020, which reduced other operating expenses in second quarter 2020. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. operating expenses per asm for 2021, excluding fuel and oil expense, profitsharing, and special items (a non-gaap financial measure), decreased 13.3 percent, year-over-year. see note regarding use of non-gaap financial measures and the reconciliation of reported amounts to non-gaap financial measures for additional detail regarding non-gaap financial measures.
salaries, wages, and benefits expense for 2021 increased by $932 million, or 13.7 percent, compared with 2020. on a per asm basis, salaries, wages, and benefits expense for 2021 decreased 10.8 percent, compared with 2020. on a dollar basis, approximately 55 percent of the increase was due to higher salaries and wages due to significantly more trips, step increases for certain workgroups, recalls from extended eto (which led to higher salaries), incentive pay offered to certain workgroups, and increased overtime hours across the network. the largest portion of the remainder of the increase was due to the $230 million profitsharing expense accrual in 2021, compared with no profitsharing expense accrual in 2020.

payroll support and voluntary employee programs, net (a reduction to expense) for 2021 was an increase of $2.0 billion, or 206.1 percent, compared with 2020. on a per asm basis, payroll support and voluntary employee programs, net for 2021 increased by 138.3 percent. on both a dollar and per asm basis, the changes were due to the components of this line item as noted below:
•the $745 million accrual for charges related to the voluntary separation program in 2020;
•the $140 million net reduction in the extended eto liability in 2021, compared with the $625 million accrual for charges related to the extended eto liability in 2020;
•the payroll support programs' grant allocation of $2.7 billion in 2021, compared with a $2.3 billion allocation in 2020; and
•the $117 million in employee retention tax credits recorded in 2021 for continuing to pay employees' salaries during the time they were not working, as allowed under the cares act, and subsequent legislation.

the company's fourth quarter 2021 available seat miles per gallon ("fuel efficiency") declined 4.2 percent, year-over-year, due to the removal from storage and return to service of more of the company's least fuel-efficient aircraft, the -700, to support sequentially increasing flight schedules. when compared with fourth quarter 2019, fuel efficiency improved 3.8 percent in fourth quarter 2021 due to the march 2021 return to service of the company's most fuel-efficient aircraft, the max. the max remains critical to the company's efforts to modernize its fleet, reduce carbon emissions intensity, and achieve its near-term environmental sustainability goals. see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
as of january 20, 2022, on an economic basis, the company had derivative contracts in place related to expected future fuel consumption as follows:

(a) the company's hedge position includes prices at which the company considers "catastrophic" coverage. the maximum gallons provided are not indicative of the company's hedge coverage at every price, but represent the highest level of coverage at a single price. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
(b) the company's gallons that are covered by derivative contracts represent the maximum number of gallons hedged for each respective period, which may be at different strike prices and at strike prices materially higher than the current market prices. the volume of gallons covered by derivative contracts that ultimately get exercised in any given period may vary significantly from the volumes provided, as market prices and the company's fuel consumption fluctuates. based on the company's available seat mile plans for full year 2022, its maximum percent of estimated fuel consumption covered by fuel derivative contracts is 64 percent. the company believes that providing the maximum percent of fuel consumption covered by derivative contracts in future years relative to 2019 fuel gallons consumed is a more relevant measure for future coverage, due to uncertainty regarding available seat mile plans in future years. based on 2019 fuel gallons consumed, the company's maximum percent of fuel consumption covered by fuel derivative contracts is 37 percent in 2023 and 17 percent in 2024.
as a result of applying hedge accounting in prior periods, the company has amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("aoci") that will be recognized in earnings in future periods when the underlying fuel derivative contracts settle. the following table displays the company's estimated fair value of remaining fuel derivative contracts (not considering the impact of the cash collateral provided to or received from counterparties - see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information), as well as the deferred amounts in aoci at december 31, 2021, and the expected future periods in which these items are expected to settle and/or be recognized in earnings (in millions):

(a) brent crude oil average market prices as of january 20, 2022, were approximately $87 and $84 per barrel for first quarter 2022 and full year 2022, respectively.
(b) fuel hedging premium expense per gallon is included in the company's estimated economic fuel price per gallon estimates above.
(c) based on the company's existing fuel derivative contracts and market prices as of january 20, 2022, first quarter 2022 economic fuel costs are estimated to be in the $2.25 to $2.35 per gallon range, including fuel hedging premium expense of approximately $26 million, or $0.06 per gallon, and $0.35 per gallon in favorable cash settlements from fuel derivative contracts. see note regarding use of non-gaap financial measures.
(d) based on the company's existing fuel derivative contracts and market prices as of january 20, 2022, full year 2022 economic fuel costs are estimated to be in the $2.25 to $2.35 per gallon range, including fuel hedging premium expense of approximately $96 million, or $0.05 per gallon, and $0.28 per gallon in favorable cash settlements from fuel derivative contracts. see note regarding use of non-gaap financial measures.
(e) the company's current fuel derivative contracts contain a combination of instruments based in west texas intermediate ("wti") and brent crude oil; however, the economic fuel price per gallon sensitivities provided, assume the relationship between brent crude oil and refined products based on market prices as of january 20, 2022. economic fuel cost projections do not reflect the potential impact of special items because the company cannot reliably predict or estimate the hedge accounting impact associated with the volatility of the energy markets, the impact of covid-19 cases on air travel demand, or the impact to its financial statements in future periods. accordingly, the company believes a reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to the equivalent gaap financial measures for projected results is not meaningful or available without unreasonable effort. see note regarding use of non-gaap financial measures.
maintenance materials and repairs expense for 2021 increased by $104 million, or 13.9 percent, compared with 2020. on a per asm basis, maintenance materials and repairs expense decreased 9.7 percent, compared with 2020. on a dollar basis, approximately 50 percent of the increase was due to the timing of regular airframe maintenance checks as some costs had previously been deferred while a portion of the fleet was placed into temporary storage during the covid-19 pandemic. the majority of the remainder of the increase was due to higher engine maintenance expense due to the increase in flight hours.
landing fees and airport rentals expense for 2021 increased by $216 million, or 17.4 percent, compared with 2020. on a per asm basis, landing fees and airport rentals expense decreased 9.1 percent, compared with 2020. on a dollar basis, approximately 50 percent of the increase was due to higher landing fees from the increased number of trips flown, and the remainder of the increase was due to an increase in space rental rates at many airports.
depreciation and amortization expense for 2021 increased by $17 million, or 1.4 percent, compared with 2020. on a per asm basis, depreciation and amortization expense decreased 20.7 percent, compared with 2020. on a dollar basis, the majority of the increase was associated with the deployment of new technology assets during 2021.
other operating expenses for 2021 increased by $468 million, or 24.3 percent, compared with 2020. included within this line item was aircraft rentals expenses in the amount of $205 million and $209 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively. on a per asm basis, other operating expenses decreased 3.2 percent, compared with 2020. on a dollar basis, the increase was primarily due to $222 million in gains from the sale-leaseback of 20 aircraft to third parties in two separate transactions during second quarter 2020, which reduced other operating expenses in second quarter 2020. excluding the impact of this 2020 sale-leaseback gain, the increase in other operating expenses on a dollar basis was primarily due to higher revenue related expenses, including credit card processing charges. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
other other expenses (income) include interest expense, capitalized interest, interest income, and other gains and losses.
interest expense for 2021 increased by $118 million, or 33.8 percent, compared with 2020, primarily due to higher debt balances. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
capitalized interest for 2021 increased by $1 million, or 2.9 percent, compared with 2020, primarily due to boeing resuming production of the company's undelivered max aircraft.
interest income for 2021 decreased by $19 million, or 59.4 percent, compared with 2020, due to lower interest rates.
other (gains) losses, net, primarily includes amounts recorded as a result of the company's hedging activities. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company's hedging activities. the following table displays the components of other (gains) losses, net, for 2021 and 2020:

(b) tax amounts for each individual special item are calculated at the company's effective rate for the applicable period and totaled in this line item.
(c) adjustment related to gaap and non-gaap tax rate differences, primarily due to the payroll support being excluded as a special item, and reflecting the anticipated benefit of carrying back full year 2020 projected net losses to claim tax refunds against previous cash taxes paid relating to tax years 2015 through 2019, some of which were at higher rates than the current year.
(d) adjustment related to gaap and non-gaap diluted weighted average shares difference, due to the company being in a net income position on a gaap basis versus a net loss position on a non-gaap basis for the year ended december 31, 2021. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
note regarding use of non-gaap financial measures the company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap"). these gaap financial statements may include (i) unrealized noncash adjustments and reclassifications, which can be significant, as a result of accounting requirements and elections made under accounting pronouncements relating to derivative instruments and hedging and (ii) other charges and benefits the company believes are unusual and/or infrequent in nature and thus may make comparisons to its prior or future performance difficult.
as a result, the company also provides financial information in this filing that was not prepared in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with gaap. the company provides supplemental non-gaap financial information (also referred to as "excluding special items"), including results that it refers to as "economic," which the company's management utilizes to evaluate its ongoing financial performance and the company believes provides additional insight to investors as supplemental information to its gaap results. the non-gaap measures provided that relate to the company's performance on an economic fuel cost basis include fuel and oil expense, non-gaap; total operating expenses, non-gaap; operating expenses, non-gaap excluding fuel and oil expense; operating expenses, non-gaap excluding fuel and oil expense and profitsharing; operating loss, non-gaap; other (gains) losses, net, non-gaap; loss before income taxes, non-gaap; benefit for income taxes, net, non-gaap; net loss, non-gaap; net loss per share, diluted, non-gaap; and operating expenses per asm, non-gaap, excluding fuel and oil expense and profitsharing (cents). the company's economic fuel and oil expense results differ from gaap results in that they only include the actual cash settlements from fuel hedge contracts - all reflected within fuel and oil expense in the period of settlement. thus, fuel and oil expense on an economic basis has historically been utilized by the company, as well as some of the other airlines that utilize fuel hedging, as it reflects the company's actual net cash outlays for fuel during the applicable period, inclusive of settled fuel derivative contracts. any net premium costs paid related to option contracts that are designated as hedges are reflected as a component of fuel and oil expense, for both gaap and non-gaap (including economic) purposes in the period of contract settlement. the company believes these economic results provide further insight into the impact of the company's fuel hedges on its operating performance and liquidity since they exclude the unrealized, noncash adjustments and reclassifications that are recorded in gaap results in accordance with accounting guidance relating to derivative instruments, and they reflect all cash settlements related to fuel derivative contracts within fuel and oil expense. this enables the company's management, as well as investors and analysts, to consistently assess the company's operating performance on a year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter basis after considering all efforts in place to manage fuel expense. however, because these measures are not determined in accordance with gaap, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations, and not all companies calculate the measures in the same manner. as a result, the aforementioned measures, as presented, may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
further information on (i) the company's fuel hedging program, (ii) the requirements of accounting for derivative instruments, and (iii) the causes of hedge ineffectiveness and/or mark-to-market gains or losses from derivative instruments is included in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
the company's gaap results in the applicable periods may include other charges or benefits that are also deemed "special items," that the company believes make its results difficult to compare to prior periods, anticipated future periods, or industry trends. financial measures identified as non-gaap (or as excluding special items) have been adjusted to exclude special items. for the periods presented, in addition to the items discussed above, special items include:
1.proceeds related to the payroll support programs, which were used to pay a portion of employee salaries, wages, and benefits;
2.charges and adjustments to previously accrued amounts related to the company's extended leave programs;
3.adjustments for prior period losses reclassified from aoci associated with forward-starting interest rate swap agreements that were terminated in prior periods related to 12 -8 aircraft leases;
4.gains associated with the sale-leaseback of ten boeing 737-800 aircraft and ten boeing -8 aircraft to third parties;
5.a noncash impairment charge related to 20 boeing 737-700 aircraft that were retired during 2020 and 8 boeing 737-700 aircraft that were retired in 2021;
6.unrealized losses related to 12 forward-starting interest rate swap agreements. during 2020, the interest rate swap agreements, which were related to 12 -8 aircraft leases (with deliveries originally scheduled between june 2020 and september 2020), were de-designated as hedges due to the scheduled delivery range no longer being probable, resulting in the mark-to-market changes being recorded to earnings;
7.losses associated with the partial extinguishment of the company's convertible notes; and
8.a post-retirement curtailment charge related to employees who accepted voluntary separation program 2020 and elected to participate in the company's retiree medical benefits plan.
because management believes special items can distort the trends associated with the company's ongoing performance as an airline, the company believes that evaluation of its financial performance can be enhanced by a supplemental presentation of results that exclude the impact of special items in order to enhance consistency and comparativeness with results in prior periods that do not include such items and as a basis for evaluating operating results in future periods. the following measures are often provided, excluding special items, and utilized by the company's management, analysts, and investors to enhance comparability of year-over-year results, as well as to industry trends: fuel and oil expense, non-gaap; total operating expenses, non-gaap; operating expenses, non-gaap excluding fuel and oil expense; operating expenses, non-gaap excluding fuel and oil expense and profitsharing; operating loss, non-gaap; other (gains) losses, net, non-gaap; loss before income taxes, non-gaap; benefit for income taxes, net, non-gaap; net loss, non-gaap; net loss per share, diluted, non-gaap; and operating expenses per asm, non-gaap, excluding fuel and oil expense and profitsharing (cents).
liquidity and capital resources the enormous impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the u.s. travel industry created an urgent liquidity crisis for the entire airline industry, including the company. however, due to the company's pre-pandemic low balance sheet leverage, large base of unencumbered assets, and investment-grade credit ratings, the company was able to quickly access additional liquidity during 2020, as customer cancellations and ticket refunds spiked and sales and revenues dropped while the company continued to experience significant fixed operating expenses. see note 2 and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, as well as the transactions completed and assistance obtained under payroll support programs.
net cash provided by operating activities for 2021 was $2.3 billion, and net cash used in operating activities for 2020 was $1.1 billion. operating cash inflows are historically primarily derived from ticket sales associated with providing air transportation to customers. the vast majority of tickets are purchased prior to the day on which travel is provided and, in some cases, several months before the anticipated travel date. operating cash outflows are related to the recurring expenses of airline operations. operating cash flows for 2021 included $2.7 billion in payroll support program grant proceeds received. the net increase in operating cash flows was also a result of a $591 million increase in air traffic liability driven by increased ticket sales related to an increase in leisure travel demand. the operating cash flows for 2020 were affected primarily by (i) the initial, most significant, impacts of the covid-19 pandemic, which resulted in a significant drop in travel demand, sales, and revenues, leading to the company's net loss (as adjusted for noncash items), and (ii) the company's funding of its $667 million 2019 profitsharing distribution to employees in 2020. in 2020, these net decreases in cash from operating activities were partially offset by a $1.6 billion increase in air traffic liability and by $2.4 billion in payroll support program grant proceeds received. the increase in air traffic liability was due to ticket sales in early 2020 for future travel that have not been flown as a result of the significant number of customer trip cancellations associated with the covid-19 pandemic, and growth in rapid rewards points earned due to multiple loyalty credit card promotions throughout 2020. cash flows associated with entering into new fuel derivatives, which are classified as other, net, operating cash flows, were net outflows of $34 million in 2021 and $129 million in 2020. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. net cash provided by operating activities is primarily used to finance capital expenditures, repay debt, and provide working capital. historically, the company has also used net cash provided by operating activities to fund stock repurchases and pay dividends; however these shareholder return activities have been suspended due to restrictions associated with the payroll assistance under the payroll support programs and the company's $1.0 billion amended and restated revolving credit facility (the "amended a&r credit agreement"). see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
net cash used in investing activities for 2021 and 2020 was $1.3 billion and $16 million, respectively. investing activities in both years included capital expenditures, and changes in the balance of the company's short-term and noncurrent investments. during 2020, the company also raised $815 million from the sale-leaseback of 20 aircraft (see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for more details on the sale-leaseback transactions) and received $428 million of supplier proceeds, which the company considers an offset to its aircraft capital expenditures. see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. during 2021, capital expenditures were $505 million, compared with $515 million in the same prior year period. the company continues to estimate its 2022 capital spending to be approximately $5.0 billion, including approximately $900 million in non-aircraft capital spending. this includes 12 2022 -8 options exercised through february 3, 2022, and assumes the company exercises all 30 remaining 2022 options. fleet and other capital investment plans are expected to evolve as the company continues to manage through the pandemic, and the company intends to continue evaluating the exercise of its remaining 30 max options for 2022 as decision deadlines occur.
net cash provided by financing activities for 2021 and 2020 was $359 million and $9.7 billion, respectively. during 2021, the company borrowed $1.1 billion under payroll support programs. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. the company repaid $905 million in debt and finance lease obligations, including the extinguishment of $203 million in principal of its convertible notes for cash payments totaling $293 million during 2021. during 2020, the company borrowed $13.6 billion, through various transactions, in order to improve its liquidity position as a result of the pandemic. an additional $2.3 billion was raised from a public offering of 80.5 million shares of common stock. these financings were partially offset by the full repayment of $3.7 billion borrowed under the company's amended and restated 364-day credit agreement and $1.0 billion drawn under the company's amended a&r credit agreement. the company also repurchased $451 million of its outstanding common stock and paid $188 million in cash dividends to shareholders in 2020 prior to restrictions associated with the payroll assistance under the payroll support programs. additionally, the company repaid $839 million in other debt and finance lease obligations during 2020.
a discussion of the company's most significant drivers impacting cash flow for 2019 are included in the company's annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2020, under part ii item 7, liquidity and capital resources.
the company is a "well-known seasoned issuer" and currently has an effective shelf registration statement registering an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities for future sales. the company currently intends to use the proceeds from any future securities sales off this shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes.
the company has access to $1.0 billion under its amended a&r credit agreement. the amended a&r credit agreement has an accordion feature that would allow the company, subject to, among other things, the procurement of incremental commitments, to increase the size of the facility to $1.5 billion. interest on the facility is based on the company's credit ratings at the time of borrowing. at the company's current ratings, the interest cost would be libor plus a spread of 200 basis points. the facility contains a financial covenant to maintain total liquidity, as defined in the amended a&r credit agreement, of $1.5 billion at all times under the amended a&r credit agreement; the company was compliant with this requirement as of december 31, 2021. there were no amounts outstanding under the amended a&r credit agreement as of december 31, 2021.
although not the case at december 31, 2021 due to the company's significant financing activities in 2020 and 2021, the company has historically carried a working capital deficit, in which its current liabilities exceed its current assets. this is common within the airline industry and is primarily due to the nature of the air traffic liability account, which is related to advance ticket sales, unused funds available to customers, and loyalty deferred revenue, which are performance obligations for future customer flights, do not require future settlement in cash, and are mostly nonrefundable. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
the company believes it has various options available to meet its capital and operating commitments, including unrestricted cash and short-term investments of $15.5 billion as of december 31, 2021, and anticipated future internally generated funds from operations. however, the covid-19 pandemic continues to evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the company's ability to meet its capital and operating commitments. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic.
the following discussion includes various short-term and long-term material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations, but does not include amounts that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time. given the company's current liquidity position, available resources, and prevailing outlook, it expects to be able to fulfill both its short-term and long-term material cash requirements. the amounts disclosed are based on various estimates, including estimates regarding the timing of payments, prevailing interest rates, volumes purchased, the occurrence of certain events and other factors. accordingly, the actual results may vary materially from the amounts discussed herein.
debt see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the company's debt and the timing of expected and future principal payments. the company also has significant future obligations associated with fixed interest payments associated with its debt. as of december 31, 2021, future interest payments associated with its fixed rate debt (excluding interest associated with finance leases) were $343 million in 2022, $301 million in 2023, $271 million in 2024, $217 million in 2025, $163 million in 2026, and $193 million thereafter.
the company's convertible notes did not meet the criteria to be converted by holders as of the date of the financial statements, and thus are classified as long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2021. if the provisions were met to allow holders to exercise their conversion option on these instruments, all of the remaining convertible notes would be reclassified as a current obligation. also, the company has engaged in transactions with certain convertible debt holders to purchase their instruments in private transactions from time to time in cash, and may continue to do so in future periods. the company considers its prevailing stock price, the trading price of its convertible debt instruments, and its available liquidity in determining how much of these instruments it may attempt to repurchase in such transactions.
leases the company enters into leases for aircraft, airports and other real property, and other types of equipment in the normal course of business. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail.
aircraft purchase commitments the company is required to make cash deposits toward the purchase of aircraft in advance. these deposits are classified as deposits on flight equipment purchase contracts in the consolidated balance sheet until the aircraft is delivered, at which time deposits previously made are deducted from the final purchase price of aircraft and are reclassified as flight equipment. see part i, item 2 for a complete table of the company's contractual firm deliveries and options for -7 and -8 aircraft, and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for the financial commitments related to these firm deliveries.
other the company's other material cash requirements primarily consist of outlays associated with normal operating expenses of the airline, including payroll, fuel, airport costs, etc. while many of these expenses are variable in nature, some of the expenditures can be somewhat fixed in the short-term due to the lead-time involved in publishing the company's flight schedule in advance and providing for resources to be available to operate those schedules.
the company has a large net deferred tax liability on its consolidated balance sheet. the deferral of income taxes has resulted in a significant benefit to the company and its liquidity position. since the company purchases the majority of the aircraft it acquires, it has been able to utilize accelerated depreciation methods (including bonus depreciation) available under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, in 2021 and in previous years, which has enabled the company to accelerate cash tax benefits of depreciation. based on the company's scheduled future aircraft deliveries from boeing and existing tax laws in effect, the company will continue to accelerate the cash income tax benefits related to aircraft purchases. however, due to the company's net taxable loss incurred in 2020, and a provision within the cares act that allows entities to carry back such 2020 losses to prior periods of up to five years, and claim refunds of federal taxes paid, the company expects to receive a significant cash tax refund of $472 million associated with this taxable loss from the internal revenue service in the first six months of 2022. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. the company has paid in the past, and will continue to pay in the future, significant cash taxes to the various taxing jurisdictions where it operates. the company expects to be able to continue to meet such obligations utilizing cash and investments on hand, as well as cash generated from its ongoing operations.
critical accounting policies and estimates the company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the company's significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. the company's estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and changes in the business environment. however, actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions, sometimes materially. critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that both (i) are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results and (ii) require management's most subjective judgments. the company's critical accounting policies and estimates are described below.
revenue recognition tickets sold for passenger air travel are initially deferred as air traffic liability. passenger revenue is recognized and air traffic liability is reduced when the service is provided (i.e., when the flight takes place). air traffic liability primarily represents tickets sold for future travel dates, funds that are past flight date and remain unused, but are expected to be used in the future, and the company's liability for loyalty benefits that are expected to be redeemed in the future. air traffic liability typically fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns, fare sale activity, and activity associated with the company's loyalty program. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information about the company's revenue recognition policies.
for air travel on southwest, the amount of tickets that will expire unused, referred to as breakage, are estimated and recognized in passenger revenue once the scheduled flight date has passed, in proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by the customer, as per accounting standards codification 606, revenue from contracts with customers. estimating the amount of tickets that will expire unused involves some level of subjectivity and judgment. the majority of the company's tickets sold are nonrefundable, although the funds remain reusable, for a period of time, in the form of a flight credit that can be applied towards the purchase of future travel. flight credits are typically created when a customer cancels or modifies an existing flight itinerary. these unused flight credits are the primary source of breakage. breakage estimates are based on historical experience over many years, and the company has consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from unused tickets at the date of scheduled travel. fully refundable tickets rarely expire unused.
as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, for all customer flight credits created or scheduled to expire between march 1 and september 7, 2020 associated with flight cancellations, the company has extended the expiration date to september 7, 2022. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these extended flight credits. since the company did not have historical data to enable it to accurately estimate the pattern of usage of these extended credits, these credits have been classified as a current liability throughout their history. due to the significant increase in time allowed by the company for these customers to redeem such credits for future travel, the percentage of the extended credits that will ultimately expire unused is currently expected to be lower than the company's historical experience with flight credits that were not extended ("normal" flight credits), and this lack of historical experience also impacts the company's ability to estimate ultimate expirations. therefore, as a result of the significant volume of these extended credits and the company's lack of historical experience associated with such extended travel credits, recognition of expected breakage will likely create volatility in certain passenger revenue metrics through september 2022. for the year ended december 31, 2021, holding other factors constant, a 10 percent change in the company's estimate of the amount of these extended credits that will expire unused would have resulted in an immaterial change in passenger revenues recognized.
also as a result of changes in observed customer travel habits and behaviors during 2021, the company has increased its estimates of "normal" customer flight credits that are expected to expire unused. although very little of these funds have yet to reach their expiration dates, customer redemptions of these "normal" credits have been at a slower rate than the company's historical data would suggest for similar credits in periods prior to the covid-19 pandemic. based on historical customer behavior, holding other factors constant, a 10 percent change in the company's estimate of the amount of "normal" tickets and/or flight credits that will expire unused would have resulted in a $59 million, or less than one percent, change in passenger revenues recognized for the year ended december 31, 2021.
observed customer behavior that differs from historical experience can cause actual ticket breakage to differ significantly from estimates. assumptions about customer behavior are reviewed frequently and corresponding adjustments are made to breakage estimates, as needed, when observed behaviors differ from historical experience. assumptions about customer behavior can be impacted by several factors including, but not limited to: fare increases, fare sales, changes to the company's ticketing policies, changes to the company's refund, exchange and unused funds policies, seat availability, and economic factors. the company's estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year; however, as with any estimates, actual ticket breakage may vary from estimated amounts. given the unprecedented amount of 2020 customer flight cancellations and the amount of travel funds available to customers for use through september 2022, the company expects additional variability in the amount of breakage recorded in future periods, especially as a percentage of revenues, as the estimates of the portion of sold tickets that will expire unused may differ from historical experience and the company's overall revenues remain below pre-covid-19 pandemic levels.
fair value measurements and financial derivative instruments the company utilizes unobservable (level 3) inputs in determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. at december 31, 2021, these consisted of its fuel derivative option contracts, which were an asset of $696 million. the company utilizes financial derivative instruments primarily to manage its risk associated with changing jet fuel prices. see "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" for more information on these risk management activities, note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the company's fuel hedging program and financial derivative instruments, and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about fair value measurements.
all derivatives are required to be reflected at fair value and recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. at december 31, 2021, the company was a party to over 175 separate financial derivative instruments related to its fuel hedging program for future periods. changes in the fair values of these instruments can vary dramatically based on changes in the underlying commodity prices. for example, during 2021, market "spot" prices for brent crude oil peaked at a high average daily price of approximately $86 per barrel and hit a low average daily price of approximately $51 per barrel. during 2020, market spot prices ranged from a high average daily price of approximately $69 per barrel to a low average daily price of approximately $19 per barrel. market price changes can be driven by factors such as supply and demand, inventory levels, weather events, refinery capacity, political agendas, the value of the u.s. dollar, geopolitical events, the extent of the covid-19 pandemic, and general economic conditions, among other items. historically, the financial derivative instruments utilized by the company primarily are a combination of collars, purchased call options, call spreads, put spreads, and fixed price swap agreements.
the company enters into financial derivative instruments with third party institutions in "over-the-counter" markets. since the majority of the company's financial derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange, the company estimates their fair values. depending on the type of instrument, the values are determined by the use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets.
the company determines the fair value of fuel derivative option contracts utilizing an option pricing model based on inputs that are either readily available in public markets, can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets, or are quoted by its counterparties. in situations where the company obtains inputs via quotes from its counterparties, it verifies the reasonableness of these quotes via similar quotes from another counterparty as of each date for which financial statements are prepared. the company has consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented and believes it has obtained the most accurate information available for the types of derivative contracts it holds. due to the fact that certain inputs used in determining the estimated fair value of its option contracts are considered unobservable (primarily implied volatility), the company has categorized these option contracts as level 3. although implied volatility is not directly observable, it is derived primarily from changes in market prices, which are observable. based on the company's portfolio of option contracts as of december 31, 2021, a 10 percent change in implied volatility, holding all other factors constant, would have resulted in a change in the fair value of this portfolio of less than $105 million.
fair values for financial derivative instruments are estimated prior to the time that the financial derivative instruments settle. however, once settlement of the financial derivative instruments occurs and the hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed, all values and prices are known and are recognized in the financial statements. although the company continues to use a prospective assessment to determine that commodities continue to qualify for hedge accounting in specific locations where the company hedges, there are no assurances that these commodities will continue to qualify in the future. this is due to the fact that future price changes in these refined products may not be consistent with historical price changes. increased volatility in these commodity markets for an extended period of time, especially if such volatility were to worsen, could cause the company to lose hedge accounting altogether for the commodities used in its fuel hedging program. further, should the anticipated fuel purchases covered by the company's fuel hedges no longer be probable of occurring, the company would discontinue hedge accounting. the loss of hedge accounting would create further volatility in the company's gaap financial results.
as discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, any changes in fair value of cash flow derivatives designated as hedges are offset within aoci until the period in which the expected future cash flow impacts earnings. any changes in the fair value of fuel derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reflected in earnings within other (gains) losses, net, in the period of the change. because the company has extensive historical experience in valuing the derivative instruments it holds, and such experience is continually evaluated against its counterparties each period when such instruments expire and are settled for cash, the company believes it is unlikely that an independent third party would value the company's derivative contracts at a significantly different amount than what is reflected in the company's financial statements. in addition, the company also has bilateral credit provisions in some of its counterparty agreements, which provide for parties (or the company) to provide cash collateral when the fair value of fuel derivatives with a single party exceeds certain threshold levels. since this cash collateral is based on the estimated fair value of the company's outstanding fuel derivative contracts, this provides further validation to the company's estimate of fair values.
loyalty accounting the company utilizes estimates in the recognition of revenues and liabilities associated with its loyalty program. these estimates primarily include the liability associated with rapid rewards loyalty member ("member") account balances that are expected to be redeemed for travel or other products at a future date. loyalty account balances include points earned through flights taken, points sold to customers, or points earned through business partners participating in the loyalty program.
under the southwest rapid rewards loyalty program, members earn points for every dollar spent on southwest base fares. the amount of points earned under the program is based on the fare amount and fare type, with higher fare types (e.g., business select) earning more points than lower fare types (e.g., wanna get away). each fare type is associated with a points earning multiplier, and points for flights are calculated by multiplying the fare amount for the flight by the fare type multiplier. likewise, the amount of points required to be redeemed for a flight can differ based on the fare type purchased. under the program, (i) members are able to redeem their points for every available seat, every day, on every flight, with no blackout dates; and (ii) points do not expire. in addition, members are able to redeem their points for items other than travel on southwest airlines, such as international flights on other airlines, cruises, hotel stays, rental cars, gift cards, event tickets, and more. in addition to earning points for revenue flights and qualifying purchases with rapid rewards partners, members also have the ability to purchase, gift, and transfer points, as well as the ability to donate points to selected charities.
the company utilizes the deferred revenue method of accounting for points earned through flights taken in its loyalty program. the company also sells points and related services to business partners participating in the loyalty program. liabilities are recorded for the relative standalone selling price of the rapid rewards points which are awarded each period. the liabilities recorded represent the total number of points expected to be redeemed by members, regardless of whether the members may have enough to qualify for a full travel award. at december 31, 2021, the loyalty liabilities were approximately $4.8 billion, including $2.6 billion classified within air traffic liability and $2.2 billion classified as air traffic liability - noncurrent.
in order to determine the value of each loyalty point, certain assumptions must be made at the time of measurement, which include an allocation of passenger revenue between the flight and loyalty points earned by passengers, and the fair value of rapid rewards points, which are generally based on their redemption value to the customer. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on determining the estimated fair value of each loyalty point.
the majority of the points sold to business partners are through the southwest co-branded credit card agreement ("agreement") with chase bank usa, n.a. consideration received as part of this agreement is subject to accounting standards codification 606, revenue from contracts with customers. the agreement has the following multiple elements: travel points to be awarded, use of the southwest airlines' brand and access to rapid rewards member lists, advertising elements, and the company's resource team. these elements are combined into two performance obligations, transportation and marketing, and consideration from the agreement is allocated based on the relative selling price of each performance obligation.
significant management judgment was used to estimate the selling price of each of the performance obligations in the agreement at inception, including each time in which the agreement has been materially amended. the objective is to determine the price at which the company would transact a sale if the product or service was sold on a stand-alone basis. the company determines the best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including, but not limited to, the estimated selling price of comparable travel, discounted cash flows, brand value, published selling prices, number of points awarded, and the number of points redeemed. the company estimates the selling prices and volumes over the term of the agreement in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple performance obligations. the company records revenue related to air transportation when the transportation is delivered and revenue related to marketing elements when the performance obligation is satisfied. a one percent increase or decrease in the company's estimate of the standalone selling prices, implemented as of january 1, 2021, causing a change to the allocation of proceeds to air transportation would not have had a material impact on the company's operating revenues for the year ended december 31, 2021.
under its current program, southwest estimates the portion of loyalty points that will not be redeemed. in estimating the breakage, the company takes into account the member's past behavior, as well as several factors related to the member's account that are expected to be indicative of the likelihood of future point redemption. these factors are typically representative of a member's level of engagement in the loyalty program. they include, but are not limited to, tenure with the program, points accrued in the program, and points redeemed in the program. the company believes it has obtained sufficient historical behavioral data to develop a predictive statistical model to analyze the amount of breakage expected for all loyalty points. the company updates this model at least annually, and applies the new breakage rates effective october 1st each year, or more frequently if required by changes in the business. changes in the breakage rates applied annually in recent years have not had a material impact on passenger revenues. for the year ended december 31, 2021, based on actual redemptions of points sold to business partners and earned through flights, a hypothetical one percentage point change in the estimated breakage rate would have resulted in a change to passenger revenue of approximately $100 million (an increase in breakage would have resulted in an increase in revenue and a decrease in breakage would have resulted in a decrease in revenue). given that member behavior will continue to develop as the program matures, the company expects the current estimates may change in future periods. however, the company believes its current estimates are reasonable given current facts and circumstances.

covid-19 and effects on commodity prices in early march 2020, oil prices dropped sharply and continued to decline, briefly reaching negative levels, as a result of multiple factors affecting the supply and demand in global oil and natural gas markets, including (i) actions taken by opec members and other exporting nations impacting commodity price and production levels and (ii) a significant decrease in demand due to the covid-19 pandemic. demand for oil and natural gas increased during 2021, as many restrictions on conducting business implemented in response to the covid-19 pandemic were lifted due to improved treatments and availability of vaccinations in the u.s. and globally. as a result, oil and natural gas market prices have improved during 2021 in response to the increase in demand. during 2021 and 2020, the posted price for west texas intermediate light sweet crude oil, or nymex wti, has ranged from $(37.63) to $84.65 bbl, and the nymex henry hub price of natural gas has ranged from $1.48 to $6.31 per mmbtu. on january 18, 2022, the closing nymex wti price for crude oil was $85.43 per bbl and the closing nymex henry hub price of natural gas was $4.28 per mmbtu. the emergence of the delta covid-19 variant in the latter part of 2021 and the subsequent surge of the highly transmissible omicron variant, however, contributed to economic and pricing volatility as industry and market participants evaluated industry conditions and production outlook. further, on january 4, 2021, opec and its non-opec allies, known collectively as opec+, agreed to continue their program (commenced in august of 2021) of gradual monthly output increases in february 2022, raising its output target by 400,000 bbls per day, which is expected to further boost oil supply in response to rising demand. in its report issued on february 10, 2022, opec noted its expectation that world oil demand will rise by 4.15 million bbls per day in 2022, as the global economy continues to post a strong recovery from the covid-19 pandemic. although this demand outlook is expected to underpin oil prices, already seen at a seven-year high in february 2022, we cannot predict any future volatility in commodity prices or demand for crude oil.
despite the recovery in commodity prices and rising demand, we kept our production relatively flat during 2021, using excess cash flow for debt repayment and/or return to our stockholders rather than expanding our drilling program.
table of contents outlook during 2021, we continued building on our execution track record, generating free cash flow while keeping capital costs under control, and our efficiency gains, particularly in the midland basin drilling and completion programs, were able to mitigate certain inflationary pressures on well costs and led to a total capital expenditure amount of $1.5 billion down 11% from our guidance presented in april of 2021. we expect to continue to build on these operational efficiencies by controlling the variable portion of our operating and capital costs, which we believe will help mitigate the inflationary pressures seen across our business. we remain committed to capital discipline by maintaining flat oil production in 2022 and expect to maintain our best-in-class capital efficiency and cost structure. we expect to be in a position to continue to deliver on the recently announced enhanced capital return program, where we expect to distribute at least 50% of our quarterly free cash flow to our stockholders. our capital return program is currently focused on our sustainable and growing dividend and a combination of stock repurchases and variable dividends. we expect to remain flexible on returning capital to our stockholders, depending on which method our board of directors believes presents the best return of capital to our stockholders at the relevant time.
in the midland basin, we continued to have positive results across our core development areas located within midland, martin, howard, glasscock and andrews counties, where development has primarily focused on drilling long-lateral, multi-well pads targeting the spraberry and wolfcamp formations.
in the delaware basin, we have now drilled and completed a significant number of wells in pecos, reeves and ward counties targeting the wolfcamp a, which we believe has been de-risked across a significant portion of our total acreage position and remains our primary development target. in 2022, we expect to focus development on these areas.
as of december 31, 2021, we were operating 10 drilling rigs and four completion crews and currently intend to operate between 10 and 12 drilling rigs and between three and four completion crews in 2022 on average across our current acreage position in the midland and delaware basins.
environmental responsibility initiatives and highlights in february 2021, we announced significant enhancements to our commitment to environmental, social responsibility and governance, or esg, performance and disclosure, including scope 1 and methane emission intensity reduction targets. our goals include the reduction of our scope 1 greenhouse gas intensity by at least 50% and methane intensity by at least 70%, in each case by 2024 from the 2019 levels. to further underscore our commitment to carbon neutrality, we have also implemented our "net zero now" initiative under which, effective january 1, 2021, we strive to produce every hydrocarbon molecule with zero scope 1 emissions. to the extent our greenhouse gas and methane intensity targets do not eliminate our carbon footprint, we have purchased carbon credits to offset the remaining emissions. we have also increased the weighting of esg metrics in our annual short-term incentive compensation plan to motivate our executives to advance our environmental responsibility goals.
in september 2021, we announced our long-term goal to end routine flaring by 2025 and a long-term target to source over 65% of our water used for drilling and completion operations from recycled sources by 2025. with respect to flaring, we flared 1.55% of our gross natural gas production in the fourth quarter of 2021. for the full year ended 2021, we flared 1.45% of our gross natural gas production, down 26% from 2020.
2022 capital budget we have currently budgeted 2022 total capital spend of $1.75 billion to $1.90 billion. should commodity prices weaken, we intend to act responsibly and, consistent with our prior practices, reduce capital spending. if commodity prices strengthen, we intend to maintain flat oil production, pay down indebtedness and return cash to our stockholders.

comparison of the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020
oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues. our revenues are a function of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes.
table of contents our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues increased by approximately $4.0 billion, or 145%, to $6.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021 from $2.8 billion for the year ended december 31, 2020. higher average oil prices, and to a lesser extent natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, contributed $3.3 billion of the total increase. the remainder of the overall change is due to a 25% increase in combined volumes sold.
higher commodity prices during 2021 compared to 2020 primarily reflect a recovery from historically low prices experienced in 2020 due to the covid-19 pandemic as discussed in "-2021 transactions and recent developments" above. the increase in production for 2021 compared to 2020 resulted primarily from the guidon acquisition and qep merger during the first quarter of 2021 and an overall recovery in our drilling and production activities after curtailments in the second quarter of 2020 in response to the covid-19 pandemic. we expect to hold our oil production levels flat during 2022.
lease operating expenses. the following table shows lease operating expenses for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020:

lease operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 increased by $140 million, or $0.25 per boe, primarily due to an increase in production between periods driven by the guidon acquisition and the qep merger in the first quarter of 2021. the increase on a per boe basis is primarily related to the williston basin assets acquired in the qep merger which had higher lease operating costs per boe on average than our historical properties. we completed the divestiture of the williston basin properties in october 2021.
including the impact of our acquisition and divestiture activity in 2021 and future production plans, our total lease operating expenses in 2022 are expected to range from approximately $539 million to $618 million.

in general, production taxes are directly related to production revenues. production taxes for the year ended december 31, 2021 increased by $214 million, or $1.32 per boe. the increase in production taxes is attributable to an increase in commodity prices, as well as an increase in overall production due to assets acquired in 2021. the current year increase on a per boe basis is primarily driven by an increase in current year commodity prices. production taxes as a percentage of production revenues increased for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 due primarily to the acquired williston basin properties which have a higher production tax rate than our other properties. we completed the divestiture of the williston basin properties in october 2021.
ad valorem taxes are based, among other factors, on property values driven by prior year commodity prices. ad valorem taxes for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 increased by $16 million primarily due to additional properties acquired in the guidon acquisition and the qep merger.
we expect production taxes to be approximately between 7% and 8% of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenue during 2022.
table of contents gathering and transportation expense. the following table shows gathering and transportation expense for the year ended december 31, 2021 and 2020:
year ended december 31,
2021                                                                                   2020
(in millions, except per boe amounts)        amount                     per boe                    amount                     per boe gathering and transportation expense         $212                       $1.55                      $140                       $1.27
for the year ended december 31, 2021, the increase for gathering and transportation expenses are primarily attributable to the increase in production between periods. the current year increase on a per boe basis is primarily driven by production added from the assets acquired in the qep merger which, in general, had higher average gathering and transportation costs per boe than our historical properties, particularly those qep assets located in the williston basin, which we divested in the fourth quarter of 2021. after giving effect to the 2021 acquisition and divestiture activities, we expect gathering and transportation expenses to range from approximately $212 to $243 million in 2022.
midstream services expense. the following table shows midstream services expense for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020:
year ended december 31,
2021                                            2020
(in millions)
midstream services expense       $89                           $105
midstream services expense represents costs incurred to operate and maintain our oil and natural gas gathering and transportation systems, natural gas lift, compression infrastructure and water transportation facilities. in the fourth quarter of 2021, we and rattler divested our natural gas gathering and transportation assets. midstream services expense for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 decreased by $16 million primarily due to decreased maintenance costs, partially offset by increased fees for use of third party disposal systems.
depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion. the following table provides the components of our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020:
year ended december 31,

depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion expense          $1,275                          $1,311
oil and natural gas properties depletion per boe                      $8.77                          $11.30
the decrease in depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties of $40 million for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 resulted primarily from a reduction in the average depletion rate partially offset by increased production in 2021. the decline in rate resulted primarily from higher sec oil prices utilized in the reserve calculations during 2021, lengthening the economic life of the reserve base and resulting in higher projected remaining reserve volumes on our wells.
impairment of oil and natural gas properties. no impairment expense was recorded for the year ended december 31, 2021. in connection with the qep merger and the guidon acquisition, we recorded the oil and natural gas properties acquired at fair value. pursuant to sec guidance, we determined the fair value of the properties acquired in the qep merger and the guidon acquisition clearly exceeded the related full cost ceiling limitation beyond a reasonable doubt. as such, we requested and received a waiver from the sec to exclude the acquired properties from the first quarter 2021 ceiling test calculation. as a result, no impairment expense related to the qep merger and the guidon acquisition was recorded for the three months ended march 31, 2021. had we not received the waiver from the sec, an impairment charge of approximately $1.1 billion would have been recorded in the first quarter of 2021. the properties acquired in the qep merger and the guidon acquisition had total unamortized costs at march 31, 2021 of $3.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.
table of contents as a result of the sharp decline in commodity prices during 2020, we recorded non-cash ceiling test impairments for the year ended december 31, 2020 of $6.0 billion which is included in accumulated depletion, depreciation, amortization and impairment on our consolidated balance sheet. impairment charges affect our results of operations but do not reduce our cash flow. in addition to commodity prices, our production rates, levels of proved reserves, future development costs, transfers of unevaluated properties and other factors will determine our actual ceiling test calculation and impairment analysis in future periods. if the trailing 12-month commodity prices fall as compared to the commodity prices used in prior quarters, we may have material write-downs in subsequent quarters. see note 8-property and equipment for further details regarding factors that impact the impairment of oil and natural gas properties.
general and administrative expenses. the following table shows general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020:

general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 increased by $58 million primarily due to additional payroll and other employee driven costs of $32 million related to the qep merger and the guidon acquisition as well as $10 million of additional expense related to the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system. additionally, equity compensation for the year ended december 31, 2021 increased by $14 million compared to the same period in 2020.
we expect cash general and administrative expenses to range from approximately $87 million to $110 million in 2022, and non-cash stock-based compensation to range from approximately $54 million to $69 million in 2022.

net interest expense increased by $2 million for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. this increase primarily consisted of (i) $47 million in interest costs on the newly issued march 2021 notes (ii) $25 million due to incurring a full year of interest expense in 2021 related to our may 2020 notes and rattler's 5.625% senior notes due 2025, and (iii) to a lesser extent, interest expense incurred on the qep notes that remained outstanding following the qep merger completed in march 2021. these increases were partially offset by (i) $33 million in additional capitalized interest costs, (ii) interest cost savings of $23 million on the repurchases of our 2025 senior notes in march 2021 and august 2021, (iii) $8 million on the repurchase of our 4.625% senior notes of energen (iv) a $9 million reduction in borrowings under our revolving credit agreements during 2021, and (v) to a lesser extent, interest savings on the repurchase of our 2023 notes in november 2021. we expect interest expense, net of interest income to range from approximately $148 million to $178 million in 2022. see note 11-debt for further details regarding outstanding borrowings and interest expense.

(2)the year ended december 31, 2020 includes cash received on commodity contracts terminated prior to their contractual maturity of $17 million.
(3)the year ended december 31, 2021 includes cash received on interest rate swap contracts terminated prior to their contractual maturity of $80 million.
we are required to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value. we have not designated our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes. as a result, we mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the cash and non-cash changes in fair value on derivative instruments in our consolidated statements of operations under the line item captioned "gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net." as part of the qep merger, we received by novation from qep certain derivative instruments which are included on our balance sheet as of december 31, 2021.
we have designated certain of our interest rate swaps as fair value hedges for accounting purposes. as a result, gains and losses due to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps completely offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt and no gain or loss is recognized due to hedge effectiveness. changes in fair value are recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the 2029 notes in the consolidated balance sheet. beginning on december 1, 2021, we began recording semi-annual cash settlements of these interest rate swaps in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
table of contents at december 31, 2021, we have a short-term derivative asset of $13 million, a long-term derivative asset of $4 million, a short-term derivative liability due in 2022 of $174 million and a long-term derivative liability due in 2023 of $29 million.

the changes in our income tax provision for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 were primarily due to the increase in pre-tax income for the year ended december 31, 2021.
liquidity and capital resources overview of sources and uses of cash historically, our primary sources of liquidity include cash flows from operations, proceeds from our public equity offerings, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and sales of non-core assets. our primary uses of capital have been for the acquisition, development and exploration of oil and natural gas properties. at december 31, 2021, we had approximately $2.2 billion of liquidity consisting of $0.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.6 billion available under our credit facility. as discussed below, our capital budget for 2022 is $1.75 billion to $1.90 billion. further, we have $45 million of senior notes maturities in the next 12 months.
our working capital requirements are supported by our cash and cash equivalents and our credit facility. we may draw on our revolving credit facility to meet short-term cash requirements, or issue debt or equity securities as part of our longer-term liquidity and capital management program. because of the alternatives available to us as discussed above, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity are adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, dividend payments, debt service obligations and repayment of debt maturities, stock repurchase program and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.
future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices, and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties. in order to mitigate this volatility, we entered into derivative contracts with a number of financial institutions, all of which are participants in our credit facility, hedging a portion of our estimated future crude oil and natural gas production through the end of 2023 as discussed further in note 15-derivatives and item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk-commodity price risk. the level of our hedging activity and duration of the financial instruments employed depend on our desired cash flow protection, available hedge prices, the magnitude of our capital program and our operating strategy.
as we pursue our business and financial strategy, we regularly consider which capital resources, including cash flow and equity and debt financings, are available to meet our future financial obligations, planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements. our future ability to grow proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us. continued prolonged volatility in the capital, financial and/or credit markets due to the covid-19 pandemic, the depressed commodity markets and/or adverse macroeconomic conditions may limit our access to, or increase our cost of, capital or make capital unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all. although the company expects that its sources of funding will be adequate to fund its short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, we cannot assure you that the needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all.

operating activities our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables, the most significant of which is the volatility of prices for the oil and natural gas we produce. prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. regional and worldwide economic activity, weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products. these factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. see item 1a. "risk factors" above.
the increase in operating cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily resulted from (i) an increase of $4.0 billion in our total revenues, and (ii) receipt of $152 million in refunds of income taxes receivable related to the carryback of federal net operating losses and the accelerated refund of minimum tax credits allowed under the cares act in 2020. these net cash inflows were partially offset by (i) a reduction of $1.5 billion due to making net cash payments of $1.2 billion on our derivative contracts in the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to receiving net cash of $250 million on our derivative contracts in the year ended december 31, 2020, (ii) an increase in our cash operating expenses of approximately $550 million primarily due to the qep merger and the guidon acquisition, and (iii) other working capital changes, primarily due to recording increases in accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued capital expenditure activity stemming from the qep merger and the guidon acquisition in 2021. see "-results of operations" for discussion of significant changes in our revenues and expenses.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion compared to $2.1 billion for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. the majority of our net cash used for investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2021 was for the purchase and development of oil and natural gas properties and related assets, including the acquisition of certain leasehold interests as part of the guidon acquisition. these expenditures were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of our williston basin assets, leasehold acreage and other gathering assets discussed in note 4-acquisitions and divestitures.
the majority of our net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2020 was for drilling and completion costs in conjunction with our development program. our capital expenditures for each period are discussed further below.

financing activities net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2021 was $1.8 billion compared to net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2020 of $37 million. during the year ended december 31, 2021, the amount used in financing activities was primarily attributable to (i) $3.2 billion paid for the repurchase of outstanding principal on certain senior notes as discussed in "-repurchases of notes" below, as well as $178 million of additional premiums paid in connection with the repurchases, (ii) $525 million of repurchases as part of the share and unit repurchase programs, (iii) $312 million of dividends paid to stockholders, and (iv) $112 million in distributions to non-controlling interest. the cash outflows were partially offset by (i) $2.2 billion in proceeds from the march 2021 notes, (ii) $313 million of borrowings under our and our subsidiaries' credit facilities, net of repayments and (iii) $22 million in net cash receipts from the early settlement of interest rate swaps and commodity derivative contracts that contained an other-than-insignificant financing element.
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to $348 million of repayments, net of borrowings, on our credit facilities, $239 million in aggregate repayments on the energen notes and viper notes, $236 million in dividends paid to stockholders, $98 million of share repurchases as part of our stock repurchase program, and $93 million in distributions to non-controlling interest. these cash outlays were partially offset by net proceeds of $997 million from the issuance of the may 2020 notes and the rattler notes during 2020.
capital resources revolving credit facilities and other debt instruments as of december 31, 2021, our debt, including the debt of viper and rattler, consists of approximately $6.2 billion in aggregate outstanding principal amount of senior notes, $499 million in aggregate outstanding borrowings under revolving credit facilities and $58 million in outstanding amounts due under our drillco agreement.
at december 31, 2021, we have total principal payments due on our outstanding senior notes, including those of viper and rattler, of $45 million in 2022, $1.2 billion cumulatively in the years 2023 through 2024, $2.1 billion cumulatively in the years 2025 and 2026, and $3.4 billion thereafter. additionally, we expect to incur future cash interest costs on these senior notes of approximately $177 million in 2022, $371 million in the years from 2023 through 2024, $277 million in the years from 2025 through 2026, and $961 million between 2027 and 2051.
on june 2, 2021, we entered into a twelfth amendment, or the amendment, to the second amended and restated credit agreement which, among other things, decreased the total revolving loan commitments from $2.0 billion to $1.6 billion, which may be increased in an amount up to $1.0 billion (for a total maximum commitment amount of $2.6 billion) upon election of the borrower, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and satisfaction of customary conditions). as of december 31, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and $1.6 billion available for future borrowings under the revolving credit facility.
table of contents viper's revolving credit facility viper's credit agreement, as amended to date, provides for a revolving credit facility in the maximum credit amount of $2.0 billion, with a borrowing base of $580 million as of december 31, 2021, based on the viper's oil and natural gas reserves and other factors. at december 31, 2021, viper had elected a commitment amount of $500 million on its credit agreement with $304 million of outstanding borrowings. during the year ended december 31, 2021, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the operating company's revolving credit facility was 2.35%. viper's revolving credit facility matures in 2025.
rattler's revolving credit facility rattler's credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in the maximum credit amount of $600 million, which is expandable to $1.0 billion upon its election, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and satisfaction of customary conditions. as of december 31, 2021, there was $195 million of outstanding borrowings under rattler's revolving credit facility. the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the credit agreement was 1.41% for the year ended december 31, 2021. rattler's revolving credit facility matures in 2024.
during 2021, we issued an aggregate $2.2 billion of senior notes and redeemed $3.2 billion of senior notes outstanding.
for additional discussion of our outstanding debt as of december 31, 2021, see note 11-debt.
subject to market conditions, we expect to continue to issue debt securities from time to time in the future to refinance our maturing debt. the availability, interest rate and other terms of any new borrowings will depend on the ratings assigned by credit rating agencies, among other factors.
we are currently in compliance, and expect to continue to be, with all financial maintenance covenants in our debt instruments.
debt ratings we receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the u.s. in determining our debt ratings, the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including, but not limited to, commodity pricing levels, our liquidity, asset quality, reserve mix, debt levels, cost structure, planned asset sales and production growth opportunities. our credit rating from standard and poor's global ratings services is bbb-. our credit rating from fitch investor services is bbb. our credit rating from moody's investor services is baa3. any rating downgrades may result in additional letters of credit or cash collateral being posted under certain contractual arrangements.
capital requirements in addition to future operating expenses and working capital commitments discussed in -results of operations, our primary short and long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of (i) capital expenditures, (ii) payments of other contractual obligations and (iii) cash commitments for dividends and share repurchases as discussed below.
based upon current oil and natural gas prices and production expectations for 2022, we believe that our cash flow from operations, cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations through the 12-month period following the filing of this report and thereafter. however, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices, and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties. we cannot assure you that the needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. further, our 2022 capital expenditure budget does not allocate any funds for leasehold interest and property acquisitions.

2022 capital spending plan our board of directors approved a 2022 capital budget for drilling, midstream and infrastructure of $1.75 billion to $1.90 billion maintaining our annualized fourth quarter 2021 cash capital expenditure guidance presented in november of 2021. we estimate that, of these expenditures, approximately:
•$1.56 billion to $1.67 billion will be spent primarily on drilling 270 to 290 gross (248 to 267 net) horizontal wells and completing 260 to 280 gross (240 to 258 net) horizontal wells across our operated and non-operated leasehold acreage in the northern midland and southern delaware basins, with an average lateral length of approximately 10,200 feet;
•$80 million to $100 million will be spent on midstream infrastructure, excluding joint venture investments; and
•$110 million to $130 million will be spent on infrastructure and environmental expenditures, excluding the cost of any leasehold and mineral interest acquisitions.
we do not have a specific acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be accurately forecasted.
the amount and timing of our capital expenditures are largely discretionary and within our control. we could choose to defer a portion of these planned capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the success of our drilling activities, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas, the availability of necessary equipment, infrastructure and capital, the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals, seasonal conditions, drilling and acquisition costs and the level of participation by other interest owners. we were operating 10 drilling rigs and four completion crews at december 31, 2021 and currently intend to operate between 10 and 12 rigs and between three and four completion crews on average in 2022, as we continue to execute on our strategy to hold oil production flat while using cash flow from operations to reduce debt, strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to our stockholders. we will continue monitoring commodity prices and overall market conditions and can adjust our rig cadence and our capital expenditure budget up or down in response to changes in commodity prices and overall market conditions.
other contractual obligations and commitments at december 31, 2021, our other significant contractual obligations consist primarily of (i) minimum transportation commitments totaling $878 million, (ii) asset retirement obligations totaling $171 million, and (iii) minimum purchase commitment for quantities of sand used in our drilling operations totaling $77 million. we expect to make aggregate payments of approximately $105 million for these commitments during 2022. see note 9-asset retirement obligations and note 18-commitments and contingencies for further discussion of these and other contractual obligations and commitments.
dividends and share repurchases we paid common stock dividends of $312 million and $236 million during 2021 and 2020, respectively. on february 18, 2022, our board of directors declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2021 of $0.60 per share of common stock, payable on march 11, 2022 to our stockholders of record at the close of business on march 4, 2022. the decision to pay any future dividends is solely within the discretion of, and subject to approval by, our board of directors.
in september 2021, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to acquire up to $2 billion of our outstanding common stock. the stock repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended, modified, or discontinued by the board of directors at any time. we repurchased approximately $431 million of our common stock under this program during the year ended december 31, 2021, and have $1.6 billion remaining for future repurchases under the repurchase program at december 31, 2021 see note 12-stockholders' equity and earnings per share for further discussion of the repurchase program.
guarantor financial information in connection with the merger of certain of the company's wholly owned subsidiaries in an internal subsidiary restructuring on june 30, 2021, diamondback e&p became the successor borrower to diamondback o&g llc ("o&g") under the credit agreement, the successor issuer of energen's 7.125% medium-term notes, series b, due february 15, 2028 and energen's 7.32% medium-term notes, series a, due july 28, 2022, and the sole guarantor under the indentures governing the december 2019 notes, the may 2020 notes, the 2025 senior notes and the march 2021 notes.
table of contents guarantees are "full and unconditional," as that term is used in regulation s-x, rule 3-10(b)(3), except that such guarantees will be released or terminated in certain circumstances set forth in the ig indenture and the 2025 indenture, such as, with certain exceptions, (i) in the event diamondback e&p (or all or substantially all of its assets) is sold or disposed of, (ii) in the event diamondback e&p ceases to be a guarantor of or otherwise be an obligor under certain other indebtedness, and (iii) in connection with any covenant defeasance, legal defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the relevant indenture. the 2025 indenture was terminated in connection with the early redemption of the remaining $432 million principal amount of our 2025 senior notes in the third quarter of 2021.
diamondback e&p's guarantees of the december 2019 notes, the may 2020 notes and the march 2021 notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of its future subordinated indebtedness, equal in right of payment with all of its existing and future senior indebtedness, including its obligations under its revolving credit facility, and effectively subordinated to any of its existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness.
the rights of holders of the senior notes against diamondback e&p may be limited under the u.s. bankruptcy code or state fraudulent transfer or conveyance law. each guarantee contains a provision intended to limit diamondback e&p's liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance. however, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of diamondback e&p. moreover, this provision may not be effective to protect the guarantee from being voided under fraudulent conveyance laws. there is a possibility that the entire guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.
the following tables present summarized financial information for diamondback energy, inc., as the parent, and diamondback e&p, as the guarantor subsidiary, on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances between the parent and the guarantor subsidiary and (ii) equity in earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a non-guarantor. the information is presented in accordance with the requirements of rule 13-01 under the sec's regulation s-x. the financial information may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations or financial position had the guarantor subsidiary operated as an independent entity.

table of contents critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states.
certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated by our management, requiring certain assumptions to be made with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the registrant. any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.
we consider the following to be our most critical accounting estimates and have reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.
oil and natural gas accounting and reserves we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting, which is dependent on the estimation of proved reserves to determine the rate at which we record depletion on our oil and natural gas properties and whether the value of our evaluated oil and natural gas properties is permanently impaired based on the quarterly full cost ceiling impairment test. further, we utilize estimated proved reserves to assign fair value to acquired proved oil and natural gas properties including mineral and royalty interests. as such, we consider the estimation of proved reserves to be a critical accounting estimate.
oil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. our independent engineers and technical staff prepare our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and their associated future net cash flows. the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. significant inputs included in the calculation of future net cash flows include our estimate of operating and development costs, anticipated production of proved reserves and other relevant data. the data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions. as a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time, and reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates. if such changes are material, they could significantly affect future depletion of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material. revisions of previous reserve estimates accounted for approximately $719 million, or 6% of the change in the standardized measure of our total reserves from december 31, 2020 to december 31, 2021. no impairments were recorded on for our proved oil and gas properties during the year ended december 31, 2021; however, material impairments were recorded during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019 as discussed further in note 8-property and equipment of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. due to an increase in the historical 12-month average trailing sec prices for oil and natural throughout 2021 and into 2022, we are not currently projecting a full cost ceiling impairment in the first quarter of 2022.
additionally, costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves. we assess all items classified as unevaluated property (on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant) on an annual basis for possible impairment. this assessment is subjective and includes consideration of the following factors, among others: intent of the operator to drill, remaining lease term with the current operator; geological and geophysical evaluations; drilling results and activity; the assignment of proved reserves; and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned. at december 31, 2021, our unevaluated properties totaled $8 billion, which consisted of 214,151 net undeveloped leasehold acres with approximately 41,855 net acres set to expire in 2022. we did not record any impairment on our unevaluated properties during the year ended december 31, 2021, but any such future impairment could be material to our consolidated financial statements.
table of contents commodity derivatives from time to time, we use commodity derivatives for the purpose of mitigating the risk resulting from fluctuations in the market price of crude oil and natural gas. we exercise significant judgment in determining the types of instruments to be used, the level of production volumes to include in our commodity derivative contracts, the prices at which we enter into commodity derivative contracts and the counterparties' creditworthiness. we do not use these instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
we have not designated our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes and, as a result, mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the cash and non-cash change in fair value on derivative instruments for each period in the consolidated statements of operations. we are also required to recognize our derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value with such amounts classified as current or long-term based on their anticipated settlement dates. the accounting for the changes in fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation, and is generally determined using various inputs and assumptions including established index prices and other sources which are based upon, among other things, futures prices, time to maturity, implied volatilities and counterparty credit risk.
these fair values are recorded by netting asset and liability positions, including any deferred premiums, that are with the same counterparty and are subject to contractual terms which provide for net settlement. changes in the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments have a significant impact on our net income because we follow mark-to-market accounting and recognize all gains and losses on such instruments in earnings in the period in which they occur.
see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk-commodity price risk for additional sensitivity analysis of our open derivative positions at december 31, 2021.
business combinations we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. accordingly, identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values.
we make various assumptions in estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. fair value estimates are determined based on information that existed at the time of the acquisition, utilizing expectations and assumptions that would be available to and made by a market participant. when market-observable prices are not available to value assets and liabilities, the company may use the cost, income, or market valuation approaches depending on the quality of information available to support management's assumptions.
the most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties. the assumptions made in performing these valuations include future production volumes, future commodity prices and costs, future operating and development activities, projections of oil and gas reserves and a weighted average cost of capital rate. the market-based weighted average cost of capital rate is subjected to additional project-specific risking factors. in addition, when appropriate, we review comparable purchases and sales of natural gas and oil properties within the same regions, and use that data as a proxy for fair market value; for example, the amount a willing buyer and seller would enter into in exchange for such properties. changes in key assumptions may cause the acquisition accounting to be revised, including the recognition of additional goodwill or discount on acquisition. there is no assurance the underlying assumptions or estimates associated with the valuation will occur as initially expected. see note 4-acquisitions and divestitures of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for further discussion of the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the qep merger and guidon acquisition, including any significant changes in these estimates from the date of acquisition.
estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future. in addition, differences between the future commodity prices when acquiring assets and the historical 12-month average trailing price to calculate ceiling test impairments of upstream assets may impact net earnings.
income taxes the amount of income taxes we record requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal, state, and provincial tax jurisdictions. we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of (1) temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and (2) operating loss and tax credit table of contents carryforwards. deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted. a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
the assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets, including the assessment of whether a valuation allowance is required, entails that we make estimates of, and assumptions about, future events, including the pattern of reversal of taxable temporary differences and our future income from operations. as of december 31, 2021, we had established a total valuation allowance of $315 million, including a valuation allowance for the full amount of viper's deferred tax assets. the valuation allowance remains in place based on the uncertainty of future events, including viper's ability to generate future taxable income in excess of special allocations to be made to diamondback, and management considered this and other factors in evaluating the realizability of viper's deferred tax assets. no such valuation allowance was determined to be necessary against rattler's deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2021 based on the relative predictability of its future income stream based on its long term customer contracts. any changes in the positive or negative evidence evaluated when determining if viper's or rattler's deferred tax assets will be realized, including projected future income, could result in a material change to our consolidated financial statements. in addition, the determination to record a valuation allowance on certain tax attributes acquired from qep and certain state nol carryforwards which the company does not believe are realizable prior to expiration was based on an evaluation of available positive and negative evidence, including the annual limitation imposed by irc section 382 subsequent to an ownership change and the anticipated timing of reversal of the company's deferred tax liabilities in the applicable jurisdictions. as of december 31, 2021, although the company's recent cumulative losses represent negative evidence regarding reliance on future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences, our balance of taxable temporary differences anticipated to reverse within the carryforward period provides significant positive evidence for the determination that our remaining deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. any change in the positive or negative evidence evaluated when determining if our deferred tax assets will be realized, including projected future taxable income primarily related to the excess of book carrying value over tax basis of our oil and natural gas properties, could result in a material change to our consolidated financial statements.
the accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are often based on uncertain tax positions and assumptions that are subject to a significant amount of judgment by management. these assumptions and judgments are reviewed and adjusted as facts and circumstances change. at december 31, 2021, our uncertain tax positions were insignificant, however, material changes to our income tax accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing audits, changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters.

covid-19 considerations the world health organization categorized the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) as a pandemic. the covid-19 pandemic has caused a severe global health crisis, along with economic and societal disruptions and uncertainties, which have negatively impacted business and healthcare activity globally. as a result of healthcare systems responding to the demands of managing the pandemic, governments around the world imposing measures designed to reduce the transmission of the covid-19 virus, and individuals responding to the concerns of contracting the covid-19 virus, many optical practitioners and retailers, hospitals, medical offices and fertility clinics closed their facilities, restricted access, or delayed or canceled patient visits, exams and elective medical procedures, and many customers that have reopened are experiencing reduced patient visits. these factors have had, and in the future may have, an adverse effect on our sales, operating results and cash flows.
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we have taken an active role in addressing the ongoing pandemic's impact on our employees, suppliers, distribution channels, operations and customers, including taking precautionary measures, such as implementing contingency plans, and making operational adjustments as necessary. we have taken measures to help ensure the safety of our personnel in all our facilities, and we have endeavored and continue to follow recommended actions of government and health authorities to protect our employees worldwide.
as of the date of this filing, we have not experienced any significant disruption at our manufacturing facilities. we have had no significant disruption in our access to necessary raw materials and other supplies or with our distribution network; however, we have experienced higher unabsorbed fixed overhead costs, labor inefficiencies, higher cost of production and higher freight charges as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. our manufacturing and distribution operations have responded to the impacts related to the covid-19 pandemic, and we have been able to continue to supply our products around the world without interruption. in the future, we may decide or need to implement additional precautionary measures or operational adjustments as we deem prudent to meet consumer demand or to help further ensure employee safety. we believe that the actions we are taking have enabled us to keep our employees safe and our supply chain intact and will help us emerge from this global pandemic operationally sound and well positioned for long-term growth.
the extent to which the global covid-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions impact our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition will depend on future developments. at this time, future developments are highly uncertain, difficult to predict and largely outside of our control. these include, but are not limited to, the spread, duration and severity of the pandemic outbreak and any subsequent waves of additional outbreaks, including the emergence and spread of variants of the covid-19 virus, actions taken by governments to contain the pandemic, address its impact or respond to the reduction in global and local economic activity, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. we will continue to closely monitor the developments relating to the covid-19 pandemic and the responses from governments and private sector participants and their respective impact on our company and on our customers, suppliers, vendors and business partners.
for more information on the risks associated with the covid-19 pandemic, refer to part i, item 1a, "risk factors" herein.
outlook overall, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the worldwide contact lens and general health care markets. however, the impact, risks and uncertainty relating to the global covid-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions, as further described in the "covid-19 considerations" section above and in the "risk factors" section in part i, item 1a of this filing, have adversely affected our sales, cash flow and current performance and are likely to further adversely affect our future sales, cash flow and performance. additionally, other events affecting the economy as a whole, including but not limited to the uncertainty and instability of global markets driven by foreign currency volatility, inflation, changes in tax legislation, debt concerns, the uncertainty following the united kingdom (uk)'s withdrawal from the eu, changes to existing and new regulations, global trade barriers including additional tariffs and the trend of consolidations within the health care industry could impact our current performance and continue to represent a risk to our future performance.

transition from libor the uk's financial conduct authority (fca), which regulates the london interbank offered rate (libor), announced in july 2017 that it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for libor after 2021. in march 2021, the fca confirmed its intention to stop requiring banks to submit rates required to calculate libor after 2021. however, for u.s. dollar-denominated (usd) libor, only one-week and two-month usd libor will cease to be published after 2021, and all remaining usd libor tenors will continue being published until june 2023. further, in march 2020, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued asu 2020-04, reference rate reform (topic 848): facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting. this guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying gaap to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. we have material contracts that are indexed to libor and are continuing to monitor this activity and evaluate the related risk. we are the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continuing to evaluate the scope of impacted contracts and the potential impact. we are also monitoring the developments regarding alternative rates and may amend certain contracts to accommodate those rates if the contract does not already specify a replacement rate. while the notional value of agreements potentially indexed to libor is material, we do not expect a material impact on our financial statements related to this transition.
we believe that current cash, cash equivalents and future cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs, including working capital needs, capital expenditures and contractual obligations for at least 12 months from the issuance date of the financial statements included in this annual report. to the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our liquidity needs such as that for acquisitions, share repurchases, cash dividends or other activities as we execute our business strategy, we anticipate that additional funds will be obtained through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, additional equity financings or a combination of these potential sources of funds; however, such financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.

on january 19, 2021, coopervision acquired all of the remaining equity interests of a privately-held medical device company that develops spectacle lenses for myopia management. the fair value remeasurement of our previous equity investment immediately before the acquisition resulted in a gain of $11.5 million recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
foreign exchange loss primarily resulted from the revaluation and settlement of foreign currency-denominated balances.
other income increased in fiscal 2021, primarily due to an increase in defined benefit plan related income and a decrease in losses on minority investments during the year.
provision for income taxes the effective tax rates for fiscal 2021 and 2020 were (499.1)% and 10.6%, respectively. the decrease was primarily due to an intra-group transfer of intellectual property, as discussed below, and remeasurement of the related deferred tax assets caused by the uk enactment of a 25% corporate tax rate. the effective tax rate otherwise increased due to changes in the geographical composition of pre-tax earnings, partially offset by changes in foreign earnings subject to us tax.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was lower than the us federal statutory tax rate primarily due to the intra-group transfer, the remeasurement of deferred tax assets, and earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates partially offset by foreign earnings subject to us tax. the effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign earnings in jurisdictions with lower tax rates partially offset by foreign earnings subject to us tax.
in november 2020, we completed an intra-group transfer of certain intellectual property and related assets of the coopervision business to a uk subsidiary as part of a group restructuring to establish headquarters operations in the uk. determining fair value involved significant judgment related to future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. income before income taxes resulting from this transfer is eliminated upon consolidation. the transfer resulted in a step-up of the uk tax-deductible basis in the the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations intellectual property and goodwill, creating a temporary difference between the book basis and the tax basis of these assets. as a result, we recognized a deferred tax asset of $1,987.9 million, with a corresponding income tax benefit, during the three months ended january 31, 2021.
see note 6. income taxes of the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
share-based compensation plans we grant various share-based compensation awards, including stock options, performance shares and restricted stock units. the share-based compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2021 was $44.7 million and $5.6 million, respectively, compared to $38.6 million and $4.8 million, respectively, in fiscal 2020. as of october 31, 2021, there was $94.3 million of total unrecognized share-based compensation cost related to non-vested awards. see note 9. stock plans of the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
we estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the black-scholes valuation model, which requires management to make estimates regarding expected option life, stock price volatility and other assumptions. the use of different assumptions could lead to a different estimate of fair value. the expected life of the stock option is based on the observed and expected time to post-vesting forfeiture and/or exercise. groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. if our assumption for the expected life increased by one year, the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2021 would have increased by approximately $9.60. to determine the stock price volatility, management considers implied volatility from publicly-traded options on the company's stock at the date of grant, historical volatility and other factors. if our assumption for stock price volatility increased by one percentage point, the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2021 would have increased by approximately $2.62.
employee stock purchase plan on march 18, 2019, the company received stockholder approval for the employee stock purchase plan (espp). the first offering period began on november 4, 2019 and offerings are generally made on a quarterly basis. the purpose of the espp is to provide eligible employees of the company with the opportunity to acquire shares of common stock at 85% of the market price on the last business day of each offering period by means of accumulated payroll deductions. payroll deductions will be limited to 15% of the employee's eligible compensation, not to exceed $21.3 thousand in any one calendar year. the espp initially authorized the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of common stock. these shares will be made available from shares of common stock reacquired by the company as treasury stock. during fiscal 2021 and 2020, we issued 17,575 and 11,641 shares to our employees under the espp, respectively. at october 31, 2021, the number of shares remaining available for future issuance under the espp is 970,784 shares. total espp share-based compensation recognized during fiscal 2021 and 2020 was $1.0 million and $0.7 million.

summary of non-gaap financial measures the non-gaap financial measures that may be included in this md&a and the reasons management believes they are useful to investors are described below. these measures should be considered supplemental in nature and are not intended to be a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap. in addition, these measures may not be the same as similarly named measures presented by other companies.
free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. management believes free cash flow is useful for investors as an additional measure of liquidity because it represents cash that is available to grow the business, make strategic acquisitions, repay debt, buyback common stock or fund the dividend. we use free cash flow internally to understand, manage, make operating decisions and evaluate our business. in addition, we use free cash flow to help plan and forecast future periods.
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations constant currency is defined as excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. in order to assist with the assessment of how our underlying businesses performed, we compare the percentage change in net sales from one period to another, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. to present this information, current period revenue for entities reporting in currencies other than the united states dollar are converted into united states dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the corresponding period in the prior year.
accounting pronouncements information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in note 1. accounting policies of the consolidated financial statements.
estimates and critical accounting policies management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap. we believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap. we consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods.
the world health organization categorized the covid-19 as a pandemic. the covid-19 pandemic has caused a severe global health crisis, along with economic and societal disruptions and uncertainties, which have negatively impacted business and healthcare activity globally. as a result of healthcare systems responding to the demands of managing the pandemic, governments around the world imposing measures designed to reduce the transmission of the covid-19 virus, and individuals responding to the concerns of contracting the covid-19 virus, many optical practitioners and retailers, hospitals, medical offices and fertility clinics closed their facilities, restricted access, or delayed or canceled patient visits, exams and elective medical procedures, and many customers that have reopened are experiencing reduced patient visits. these factors have had, and in the future may have, an adverse effect on our sales, operating results and cash flows.
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates particularly as it relates to estimates reliant on forecasts and other assumptions reasonably available to the company and the uncertain future impacts of the covid-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions. the extent to which the covid-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions impact our business and financial results will depend on future developments including, but not limited to, the continued spread, duration and severity of the covid-19 pandemic; the occurrence, spread, duration and severity of any subsequent wave or waves of outbreaks, including the emergence and spread of variants of the covid-19 virus; the actions taken by the u.s. and foreign governments to contain the covid-19 pandemic, address its impact or respond to the reduction in global and local economic activity; the occurrence, duration and severity of a global, regional or national recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event; the impact of the developments described above on our customers and suppliers; and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. the accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to:
•allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses
•the carrying value of inventory the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
•the carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived assets there was not a material impact to the above estimates in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2021 as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. we continually monitor and evaluate the estimates used as additional information becomes available. adjustments will be made to these provisions periodically to reflect new facts and circumstances that may indicate that historical experience may not be indicative of current and/or future results. our future assessment of the magnitude and duration of the covid-19 pandemic, as well as other factors, could result in material changes to the estimates and material impacts to our consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.
our critical accounting policies include:
•revenue recognition - we recognize revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers and/or when services are rendered. our payment terms are typically between 30 to 120 days. provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, volume discounts, contractual pricing allowances and product returns are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.
product discounts, including certain rebates, sales incentives, and volume discounts are granted based on terms of the arrangement with direct distribution customers and at times the indirect end consumer. we evaluate contractual terms, historical experience, and perform internal analysis to estimate total product discounts at the time revenue is recognized. our paragard program is subject to medicaid rebates, which are estimated at the time of sale based upon the difference between current retail pricing and contractual medicaid pricing and an estimate of the number of units that will be sold to medicaid patients, which is informed by historical trends of claim history.
sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales return data. promotional programs, such as cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, sales incentives, volume discounts, contractual pricing allowances and product returns are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. we currently disclose the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.
•valuation of goodwill - we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fiscal third quarter and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist. we account for goodwill, evaluate and test goodwill balances for impairment in accordance with related accounting standards. we test goodwill impairment in accordance with asu 2017-04, intangibles - goodwill and other (topic 350): simplifying the test for goodwill impairment. we perform a qualitative assessment to test each reporting unit's goodwill for impairment. qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting each reporting unit. based on our qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than its carrying amount, the fair value of a reporting unit will be compared with its carrying amount and an impairment charge will be recognized for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. a reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment.
goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment. if our common stock price trades below book value per share, there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business, or a future goodwill impairment test indicates an impairment of our goodwill, we may have to recognize a non-cash impairment of goodwill that the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations could be material and could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely affect our total assets and stockholders' equity.
•business combinations - we routinely consummate business combinations. results of operations for acquired companies are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. we recognize separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired, including acquired in-process research and development, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date fair values as defined by accounting standards related to fair value measurements. key assumptions routinely utilized in allocation of purchase price to intangible assets include projected financial information such as revenue projections for companies acquired. as of the acquisition date, goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration given, over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. direct acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
•income taxes - we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax losses and tax credit carry forwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. this process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact, if any, of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets. to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction, a valuation allowance is established. tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates. to determine the tax rate, we use the full-year income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction. we update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as they are identified. changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate, and such changes could be material.
we file income tax returns in all jurisdictions in which we operate. we record a liability for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns that we have determined are not more-likely-than-not realizable. our financial statements reflect expected future tax consequences of such positions presuming the taxing authorities' full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. these tax reserves have been established based on management's assessment as to the potential exposure attributable to our uncertain tax positions as well as interest and penalties attributable to these uncertain tax positions. all tax reserves are analyzed quarterly and adjustments are made as events occur that result in changes in judgment.

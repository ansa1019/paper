item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section of our annual report on form 10-k discusses our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2019 and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 that is not included in this annual report on form 10-k can be found in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in part ii, item 7 of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2020, filed on february 12, 2021.
our free cash flow and billings measures included in the sections entitled "-key business metrics-free cash flow" and "-key business metrics-billings" are not in accordance with gaap. these non-gaap financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap. these measures may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. we encourage investors to carefully consider our results under gaap, as well as our supplemental non-gaap results, to more fully understand our business.
overview servicenow was founded on a simple premise: a better technology platform will help work flow better. the company's purpose is to make the world work better for everyone. we help global enterprises across industries, universities and governments to digitize their workflows. the now platform enables us to connect systems, silos, departments and processes with digital workflows that are simple and easy to use. we categorize the workflows we provide into four primary areas: it, employee, customer and creator. the products under each of our workflows are helping customers connect work across systems and silos to enable great experiences for people. the now platform is uniquely positioned to enable our customers' digital transformation from non-integrated enterprise technology solutions with manual and disconnected processes and activities, to integrated enterprise technology solutions with automation and connected processes and activities. the transformation to digital operations, enabled by the now platform, increases our customers' resiliency and security and delivers great experiences and additional value to their employees and consumers.
in response to the covid-19 pandemic, we continue to focus on maintaining business continuity, helping our employees, customers and communities, and preparing for the future and the long-term success of our business. we are continuing to monitor the actual and potential effects of the covid-19 pandemic across our business. the extent and continued impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business will depend on certain developments including the duration and spread of the outbreak and new variant strains of the virus; the availability and distribution of effective vaccines; the severity of the economic decline attributable to the pandemic and timing, nature and sustainability of economic recovery; and government responses, including vaccination or testing mandates, all of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable. starting late 2021, many employees began to return to our offices for at least part of the week. our return to work approach may vary among geographies depending on appropriate health protocols, and may change at any time depending on the severity of or spikes in covid-19. the impact, if any, of these and any additional operational changes we may implement is uncertain but changes we have implemented have not affected and are not expected to affect our ability to maintain operations, including financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. see the section "risk factors" in part 1, item 1a of this annual report for further discussion of the possible impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business.
key business metrics remaining performance obligations. transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations ("rpo") represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and non-cancelable amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. rpo excludes contracts that are billed in arrears, such as certain time and materials contracts, as we apply the "right to invoice" practical expedient under relevant accounting guidance. current remaining performance obligations ("crpo") represents rpo that will be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months.
as of december 31, 2021, our rpo was $11.5 billion, of which 49% represented crpo. rpo and crpo increased by 29%, respectively, compared to december 31, 2020. factors that may cause our rpo to vary from period to period include the following:
•foreign currency exchange rates. while a majority of our contracts have historically been in u.s. dollars, an increasing percentage of our contracts in recent periods has been in foreign currencies, particularly the euro and british pound sterling. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date will cause variability in our rpo.
•mix of offerings. in a minority of cases, we allow our customers to host our software by themselves or through a third-party service provider. in self-hosted offerings, we recognize a portion of the revenue upfront upon the delivery of the software and as a result, such revenue is excluded from rpo.
•subscription start date. from time to time, we enter into contracts with a subscription start date in the future and these amounts are included in rpo if such contracts are signed by the balance sheet date.
•timing of contract renewals. while customers typically renew their contracts at the end of the contract term, from time to time, customers may do so either before or after the scheduled expiration date. for example, in cases where we are successful in selling additional products or services to an existing customer, a customer may decide to renew its existing contract early to ensure that all its contracts expire on the same date. in other cases, prolonged negotiations or other factors may result in a contract not being renewed until after it has expired.
•contract duration. while we typically enter into multi-year subscription services, the duration of our contracts varies. further, we continue to see an increase in the number of 12-month agreements entered into with the u.s. federal government throughout the year, with the highest number of agreements entered into in the quarter ended september 30, driven primarily by timing of their annual budget expenditures. we sometimes also enter into contracts with durations that have a 12-month or shorter term to enable the contracts to co-terminate with the existing contract. the contract duration will cause variability in our rpo.
number of customers with acv greater than $1 million. we count the total number of customers with annual contract value ("acv") greater than $1 million as of the end of the period. we had 1,359, 1,085, and 882 customers with acv greater than $1 million as of december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. for purposes of customer count, a customer is defined as an entity that has a unique dunn & bradstreet global ultimate ("gult") data universal numbering system ("duns") number and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date. the duns number is a global standard for business identification and tracking. we make exceptions for holding companies, government entities and other organizations for which the gult, in our judgment, does not accurately represent the servicenow customer. for example, while all u.s. government agencies roll up to "government of the united states" under the gult, we count each government agency that we contract with as a separate customer. our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, spin-offs and other market activity; accordingly, we restate previously disclosed number of customers with acv greater than $1 million calculations to allow for comparability. acv is calculated based on the foreign exchange rate in effect at the time the contract was signed. foreign exchange rate fluctuations could cause some variability in the number of customers with acv greater than $1 million. we believe information regarding the total number of customers with acv greater than $1 million provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of our growing customer base and demonstrates the value customers are receiving from the now platform.
free cash flow. we define free cash flow, a non-gaap financial measure, as gaap net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment. purchases of property and equipment are otherwise included in cash used in investing activities under gaap. we believe information regarding free cash flow provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance of our business operations. however, our calculation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. a calculation of free cash flow is provided below:

we have historically seen higher collections in the quarter ended march 31 due to seasonality in timing of entering into customer contracts which is significantly higher in the quarter ended december 31. additionally, we have historically seen higher disbursements in the quarters ended march 31 and september 30 due to payouts under our annual commission plans, purchases under our employee stock purchase plan, payouts under our bonus plans and coupon payments related to our 2030 notes beginning in 2021.
renewal rate. we calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100%. our attrition rate for a period is equal to the acv from customers lost during the period, divided by the sum of (i) the total acv from all customers that renewed during the period, excluding changes in price or users, and (ii) the total acv from all customers lost during the period. accordingly, our renewal rate is calculated based on acv and is not based on the number of customers that have renewed. further, our renewal rate does not reflect increased or decreased purchases from our customers to the extent such customers are not lost customers or lapsed renewal. a lost customer is a customer that did not renew an expiring contract and that, in our judgment, will not be renewed. typically, a customer that reduces its subscription upon renewal is not considered a lost customer. however, in instances where the subscription decrease represents the majority of the customer's acv, we may deem the renewal as a lost customer. for our renewal rate calculation, we define a customer as an entity with a separate production instance of our service and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date, instead of an entity with a unique gult or duns number. we adjust our renewal rate for acquisitions, consolidations and other customer events that cause the merging of two or more accounts occurring at the time of renewal. additionally, starting in 2020, we simplified our methodology related to contracts less than 12 months to derive acv used to calculate renewal rate. previously disclosed renewal rates may be restated to reflect such adjustments or methodology simplification to allow for comparability. however, there were no material changes to such previously disclosed renewal rates. our renewal rate was 98% for each of the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. as our renewal rate is impacted by the timing of renewals, which could occur in advance of, or subsequent to the original contract end date, period-to-period comparison of renewal rates may not be meaningful.
billings. we define billings, a non-gaap financial measure, as gaap revenues recognized plus the change in total gaap unbilled receivables, deferred revenue and customer deposits as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows. the calculation of billings is provided below:

billings consists of amounts invoiced for subscription contracts with existing customers, renewal contracts, expansion contracts, contracts with new customers, and contracts for professional services and training. factors that may cause our billings results to vary from period to period include the following:
•billings duration. while we typically bill customers annually in advance for our subscription services, customers sometimes request, and we accommodate, billings with durations less than or greater than the typical 12-month term. changes in billings duration had a favorable impact of $38 million and an immaterial impact on billings for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
•contract start date. from time to time, we enter into contracts with a contract start date in the future, and we exclude these amounts from billings as these amounts are not included in our consolidated balance sheets, unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date.
•foreign currency exchange rates. while a majority of our billings have historically been in u.s. dollars, an increasing percentage of our billings in recent periods has been in foreign currencies, particularly the euro and british pound sterling. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will cause variability in our billings. foreign currency rate fluctuations had a favorable impact of $74 million and $21 million for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
•timing of contract renewals. while customers typically renew their contracts at the end of the contract term, from time to time customers may do so either before or after the scheduled expiration date. for example, in cases where we are successful in selling additional products or services to an existing customer, a customer may decide to renew its existing contract early to ensure that all its contracts expire on the same date. in other cases, prolonged negotiations or other factors may result in a contract not being renewed until after it has expired.
•seasonality. we have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements for our services. we sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as expansion with existing customers, in the fourth quarter of each year. the increase in customer agreements for the fourth quarter is primarily a result of both large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry, which are driven primarily by the expiration of annual authorized budgeted expenditures, and the terms of our commission plans which incentivize our direct sales organization to meet their annual quotas by december 31. furthermore, we usually sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month, and often the last two weeks, of each quarter. this seasonality in the timing of entering into customer contracts is sometimes not immediately apparent in our billings, due to the fact that we typically exclude cloud-offering contracts with a future start date from our billings, unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date. similarly, this seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent, and sometimes is not immediately apparent in our revenues, due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues from our cloud offering contracts over the term of the subscription agreement, which is generally 12 to 36 months. although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance. further, the seasonal factors could be heightened due to the impact of a gross domestic product contraction and other impacts unknown on our customers and sales cycles caused by the covid-19 pandemic.
to facilitate greater year-over-year comparability in our billings results, we disclose the impact that foreign currency rate fluctuations and fluctuations in billings duration had on our billings. the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations is calculated by translating the current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than u.s. dollars into u.s. dollars at the exchange rates in effect during the prior period presented, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current period. the impact of fluctuations in billings duration is calculated by replacing the portion of multi-year billings in excess of 12 months during the current period with the portion of multi-year billings in excess of 12 months during the prior period presented. notwithstanding the adjustments described above, the comparability of billings results from period to period remains subject to the impact of variations in the dollar value of contracts with future start dates and the timing of contract renewals, for which no adjustments have been presented.
while we believe billings is one indicator of the performance of our business, due to the factors described above, an increase or decrease in billings may not reflect the actual performance for that reporting period. as a result, our billings metric has become less indicative of the actual performance of our business over time and we do not plan to disclose this metric in future filings.
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. these items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material.
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we derive our revenues predominately from subscription revenues which are primarily comprised of subscription fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service, related support and updates, if any, to the subscribed service during the subscription term. for our cloud services, we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, the date we make our services available to our customers. our contracts with customers typically include a fixed amount of consideration and are generally non-cancelable and without any refund-type provisions.
subscription revenues also include revenues from self-hosted offerings in which customers deploy, or we grant customers the option to deploy without significant penalty, our subscription service internally or contract with a third party to host the software. for these contracts, we account for the software element separately from the related support and updates as they are distinct performance obligations. the transaction price is allocated to separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price ("ssp") basis. the transaction price allocated to the software element is recognized when transfer of control of the software to the customer is complete. the transaction price allocated to the related support and updates are recognized ratably over the contract term.
we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. for these contracts, the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative ssp basis. evaluating the terms and conditions included within our customer contracts for appropriate revenue recognition and determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment.
deferred commissions deferred commissions are the incremental selling costs that are associated with acquiring customer contracts and consist primarily of sales commissions paid to our sales organization and referral fees paid to independent third parties. commissions and referral fees earned upon the execution of initial and expansion contracts are primarily deferred and amortized over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years consistent with prior year. commissions earned upon the renewal of customer contracts are deferred and amortized over the average renewal term. additionally, for self-hosted offerings, consistent with the recognition of subscription revenues for self-hosted offerings, a portion of the commission cost is expensed upfront when the self-hosted offering is made available. determining the period of benefit including average renewal term requires judgment for which we take into consideration our customer contracts, our technology life cycle and other factors.
business combinations the allocation of the purchase price in a business combination requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets. the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, discount rates, the time and expense to recreate the assets and profit margin a market participant would receive. these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. the company evaluates these estimates and assumptions as new information is obtained and may record adjustments to the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed but not later than one year from the acquisition date.
income taxes our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense (benefit) and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties and the complexity of taxes on foreign earnings. we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available.
deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, carryforward periods and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. to the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available, we may release all or a portion of our valuation allowance in one or more future periods. a release of the valuation allowance, if any, would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded.
due to cumulative losses including tax deductible stock compensation and based on all available positive and negative evidence, we have determined that it is more likely than not that our u.s. deferred tax assets will not be realizable as of december 31, 2021. management applied significant judgment in assessing the positive and negative evidence available in the determination of the amount of deferred tax assets that were more likely than not to be realized in the future. in determining the need, or continued need, for a valuation allowance, we considered the weighting of the positive and negative evidence which includes, among other things, cumulative losses including tax deductible stock compensation expense , future growth, forecasted earnings, and future taxable income.
our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits. we measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision. significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law or guidance, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.
we calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified. the amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by u.s. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. the estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management's assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. to the extent the assessment of such tax position changes, we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make the determination.
change in accounting estimate in january 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful life of our data center equipment and determined we should increase the estimated useful life of data center equipment from three to four years. this change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2022. based on the carrying amount of data center equipment included in property and equipment, net that are in-service as of december 31, 2021, it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2022 operating income by approximately $80 million.
new accounting pronouncements pending adoption the impact of recently issued accounting standards is set forth in note 2, summary of significant accounting policies, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
components of results of operations revenues subscription revenues. subscription revenues are primarily comprised of fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service for both self-hosted offerings and cloud-based subscription offerings, and related standard and enhanced support and updates, if any, to the subscription service during the subscription term. for our cloud-based offerings, we recognize revenue ratably over the subscription term. for self-hosted offerings, a substantial portion of the sales price is recognized upon delivery of the software, which may cause greater variability in our subscription revenues and subscription gross margin. pricing includes multiple instances, hosting and support services, data backup and disaster recovery services, as well as future updates, when and if available, offered during the subscription term. we typically invoice our customers for subscription fees in annual increments upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal. our contracts are generally non-cancelable during the subscription term, though a customer can terminate for breach if we materially fail to perform.
professional services and other revenues. our arrangements for professional services are primarily on a time-and-materials basis, and we generally invoice our customers monthly in arrears for the professional services based on actual hours and expenses incurred. some of our professional services arrangements are on a fixed fee or subscription basis. professional services revenues are recognized as services are delivered. other revenues primarily consist of fees from customer training delivered on-site or through publicly available classes. typical payment terms require our customers to pay us within 30 days of invoice.
we sell our subscription services primarily through our direct sales organization. we also sell services through managed service providers and resale partners. we also generate revenues from certain professional services and from training of customers and partner personnel, through both our direct team and indirect channel sales. revenues from our direct sales organization represented 79%, 81% and 82% of our total revenues for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. for purposes of calculating revenues from our direct sales organization, revenues from systems integrators and managed services providers are included as part of the direct sales organization.
cost of revenues cost of subscription revenues. cost of subscription revenues consists primarily of expenses related to hosting our services and providing support to our customers. these expenses are comprised of data center capacity costs, which include colocation costs associated with our data centers as well as interconnectivity between data centers, depreciation related to our infrastructure hardware equipment dedicated for customer use, amortization of intangible assets, expenses associated with software, public cloud service costs, it services and dedicated customer support, personnel-related costs directly associated with data center operations and customer support, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead.
cost of professional services and other revenues. cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of personnel-related costs directly associated with our professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, the costs of contracted third-party partners, travel expenses and allocated overhead.
professional services are performed directly by our services team, as well as by contracted third-party partners. fees paid by us to third-party partners are primarily recognized as cost of revenues as the professional services are delivered. cost of revenues associated with our professional services engagements contracted with third-party partners as a percentage of professional services and other revenues was 14%, 10% and 15% for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation. sales and marketing expenses also include the amortization of commissions paid to our sales employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits. in addition, sales and marketing expenses include branding expenses, marketing program expenses, which include events such as knowledge, and costs associated with purchasing advertising and marketing data, software and subscription services dedicated for sales and marketing use and allocated overhead.
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our research and development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. research and development expenses also include data center capacity costs, costs associated with outside services contracted for research and development purposes and depreciation of infrastructure hardware equipment that is used solely for research and development purposes.
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, facilities and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, external legal, accounting and other professional services fees, other corporate expenses, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead.
provision for (benefit from) income taxes provision for (benefit from) income taxes consist of federal, state and foreign income taxes. due to cumulative losses, we maintain a valuation allowance against our u.s. deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2021 and 2020. we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including but not limited to earnings history, projected future outcomes, industry and market trends and the nature of each of the deferred tax assets in assessing the extent to which a valuation allowance should be applied against our u.s. and foreign deferred tax assets.

subscription revenues increased by $1.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021, compared to the prior year, driven by increased purchases by existing customers and an increase in customer count. included in subscription revenues is $241 million and $205 million of revenues recognized upfront from the delivery of software associated with self-hosted offerings during the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
we expect subscription revenues for the year ending december 31, 2022 to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to add new customers and existing customers increase their usage of our products, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended december 31, 2021. we will continue to monitor the covid-19 pandemic in 2022 and its impact on customer acquisition and renewal rates.
our expectations for revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses for the year ending december 31, 2022 are based on the 31-day average of foreign exchange rates for december 2021.

cost of subscription revenues increased by $291 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount and increased costs to support the growth of our subscription offerings including costs to support customers in regulated markets. personnel-related costs including stock-based compensation and overhead expenses increased by $123 million as compared to prior year. depreciation expense related to data center hardware and software and maintenance costs to support the expansion of our data center capacity including public cloud service costs increased by $141 million and amortization of intangibles increased by $29 million as a result of acquisitions as compared to the prior year.
we expect our cost of subscription revenues for the year ending december 31, 2022 to increase in absolute dollars as we provide subscription services to more customers and increase usage within our customer instances but slightly decrease as a percentage of revenue resulting from the change in estimated useful life of data center equipment from three to four years beginning in 2022.
our subscription gross profit percentage was 82% and 83% for each of the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. we expect our subscription gross profit percentage to slightly increase for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 driven by the change in estimated useful life of data center equipment from three to four years beginning in 2022. however, we will continue to incur incremental costs to attract customers in regulated markets by adopting public cloud offerings as well as increased support for customers impacted by new and evolving data residency requirements. to the extent future acquisitions are consummated, our cost of subscription revenues may increase due to additional non-cash charges associated with the amortization of intangible assets acquired.
cost of professional services and other revenues increased by $75 million for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year. the increase was primarily due to increased headcount to support growth resulting in an increase in personnel-related costs including stock-based compensation and overhead expenses by $55 million and an increase in outside service costs by $20 million compared to prior period.
our professional services and other gross loss percentage improved to 2% for the year ended december 31, 2021, compared to 10% in the prior year, primarily driven by the increased utilization of our internal professional services organization and the reduction in certain travel expenses. however, we expect our professional services and other gross loss percentage to worsen for the year ending december 31, 2022 as we expect additional cost to support business growth and increases in travel expenses compared to the year ended december 31, 2021.

sales and marketing expenses increased by $437 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, compared to the prior year. the increase was primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase in personnel-related costs including stock-based compensation and overhead expenses of $329 million, compared to the prior year. amortization of deferred commissions and third-party referral fees increased by $79 million, compared to the prior year, due to an increase in contracts with new customers, expansion and renewal contracts. other sales and marketing program expenses, which include branding, purchase of advertising and market data and outside services, increased by $29 million compared to the prior year. we converted certain in-person events to digital events in the first half of 2021 amid covid-19 travel restrictions which resulted in certain savings for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year.
we expect sales and marketing expenses for the year ending december 31, 2022 to increase in absolute dollars, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, as we continue to see leverage from increased sales productivity and marketing efficiencies offset by growth in our international operations and increases in travel expenses in 2022.

research and development expenses increased by $373 million during the year ended december 31, 2021, compared to the prior year. the increase was primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase in personnel-related costs including stock-based compensation and overhead expenses of $346 million compared to prior year. the remaining increase was primarily due to $22 million increase in outside services and hosting costs and data center related depreciation costs to support research and development activities.
we expect research and development expenses for the year ending december 31, 2022 to increase in absolute dollars, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, as we continue to improve the existing functionality of our services, develop new applications to fill market needs and enhance our core platform.

general and administrative expenses increased by $143 million during the year ended december 31, 2021, compared to the prior year. the increase was primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase in personnel-related costs including stock-based compensation and overhead expenses of $113 million. the remaining increase was primarily due to $21 million of outside service costs to support digital transformation projects across functions to improve processes as we scale as well as incremental investment in environmental, social and corporate governance initiatives ("esg").
we expect general and administrative expenses for the year ending december 31, 2022 to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, as we continue to see leverage from continued g&a productivity, offset by higher stock-based compensation related to the 2021 performance awards, increased investment in cyber security and our esg efforts.

stock-based compensation increased by $261 million during the year ended december 31, 2021, compared to the prior year, primarily due to additional grants to current and new employees and increased weighted-average grant date fair value of stock awards.
stock-based compensation is inherently difficult to forecast due to fluctuations in our stock price. based upon our stock price as of december 31, 2021, we expect stock-based compensation to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the year ending december 31, 2022 as we continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended december 31, 2021. we expect stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue to decline over time as we continue to grow.
foreign currency exchange our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues. revenues outside north america represented 36% and 35% of total revenues for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for sales outside of the united states, the general weakening of the u.s. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily the euro and british pound sterling) during the year ended december 31, 2021 had a favorable impact on our revenues. for entities reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31, 2021 at the exchange rates in effect for the year ended december 31, 2020 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our reported subscription revenues would have been $77 million lower. the impact from the foreign currency movements was not material for professional services and other revenues for the year ended december 31, 2021.
in addition, because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for cost of revenues and operating expenses outside of the united states, the general weakening of the u.s. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on our cost of revenue and sales and marketing expense during the year ended december 31, 2021. for entities reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31, 2021 at the exchange rates in effect for the year ended december 31, 2020 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our reported cost of revenues and sales and marketing expenses would have been $22 million and $25 million lower for the year ended december 31, 2021, respectively. the impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended december 31, 2020 to the year ended december 31, 2021 was not material to research and development and general and administrative expenses.

interest expense decreased during the year ended december 31, 2021, compared to the prior year, due to the decrease in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs as a result of lower outstanding principal balance of the 2022 notes. for the year ending december 31, 2022, we expect to incur approximately $25 million related to the 2030 notes and 2022 notes.

other income (expense), net increased by $36 million during the year ended december 31, 2021, compared to the prior year, primarily driven by the lower loss on extinguishment of the 2022 notes due primarily to the 2022 notes repurchase which occurred in 2020 and a larger amount of early conversions of the 2022 notes and lower foreign currency exchange losses, mainly offset by a decrease in interest income resulting from the decline in interest rates.
to mitigate our risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, we enter into foreign currency derivative contracts with maturities of 12 months or less to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities. these hedging contracts may reduce, but cannot entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements.

our effective tax rate was 8% and 21% for the years ended december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020. the difference in rates was primarily attributable to the mix of earnings and losses in foreign jurisdictions with differing tax rates, including a revaluation of our deferred taxes to account for a change in the united kingdom tax rate, and a partial valuation allowance release related to acquired lightstep, inc. deferred tax liabilities. see note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for (benefit from) income taxes.
we maintained a full valuation allowance on our u.s. federal and state deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. the significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes payable in various jurisdictions. the cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction's individual tax rates, laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions, and availability of net operating losses and tax credits. given the full valuation allowance on our u.s. federal and state deferred tax assets, sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules and our foreign structuring, we expect that our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. to the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available, we may release all or a portion of our valuation allowance in one or more future periods. a release of the valuation allowance, if any, would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded.
liquidity and capital resources we generate cash inflows from operations primarily from selling subscription services which are generally paid in advance of provisioning services, and cash outflows to develop new services and core technologies that further enhance the now platform, engage our customer and enhance their experience, and enable and transform our business operations. subscription services arrangements typically have a three-year duration, and we have experienced a renewal rate of 98% over the last three years. cash outflows from operations are principally comprised of the salaries, bonuses, commissions, and benefits for our workforce; licenses and services arrangements that are integral to our business operations and data centers; and operating lease arrangements that underlie our facilities. we have generated positive operating cash flows over the last ten years as we continue to grow our business in pursuit of our business strategy, and we expect to grow our business and generate positive cash flows from operations during 2022. when assessing sources of liquidity, we also include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments totaling $4.9 billion as of december 31, 2021.
our working capital requirements are principally comprised of non-contract workforce salaries, bonuses, commissions, and benefits and, to a lesser extent, cancellable and non-cancelable licenses and services arrangements that are integral to our business operations, and operating lease obligations. non-cancelable purchase commitments for business operations total $383 million as of december 31, 2021, due primarily over the next five years. in addition. we expect payment for the investment in celonis se of $100 million in the first quarter of 2022. operating lease obligations totaling $741 million are principally associated with leased facilities and have varying maturities with $418 million due over the next five years.
to grow our business, we also invest in capital and expand our facilities to enable our data centers and workforce and consider strategic acquisitions of technology and businesses to supplement our technology portfolio. our capital expenditures are typically under cancelable arrangements primarily used to support the installed base and growth of our hosted business. we have also issued long-term debt to finance our business. in august 2020, we issued 1.40% fixed rate ten-year notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion due on september 1, 2030 (the "2030 notes"). in may and june 2017, we issued the 2022 notes with an aggregate principal amount of $782.5 million. the remaining principal amount of the 2022 notes, totaling $92 million, will be settled in cash during the first half of 2022.
our free cash flows, together with our other sources of liquidity, are available to service our liabilities as well as our cancellable and non-cancellable arrangements. we anticipate cash flows generated from operations, cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. as we look beyond the next 12 months, we seek to continue to grow free cash flows necessary to fund our operations and grow our business. if we require additional capital resources, we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or additional equity or debt financing.

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to $1.8 billion for the prior year. the net increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to increase in operating income and higher collections driven by revenue growth compared to settlement of payables. in addition, we benefited from a reduction in repayments of 2022 notes attributable to debt discount.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2021 was $1.6 billion compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year. the net increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to $678 million increase in business combinations, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, and $59 million purchase of new strategic investments offset by $586 million decrease in net purchases of investments.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2021 was $506 million compared to net provided by financing activities of $597 million for the prior year. the change was primarily driven by the $1.5 billion proceeds from the issuance of 2030 notes in the year ended december 31, 2020, offset by the 2022 notes repurchase of $1.6 billion which was funded in part by the proceeds received from the partial unwind of the 2022 note hedge of $1.1 billion. the remaining change was due to $103 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards offset by $21 million increase in proceeds from employee equity plans primarily driven by higher share price compared to prior year.

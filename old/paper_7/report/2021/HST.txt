item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. this discussion focuses on our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. for a discussion and analysis of the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, please refer to management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in part ii item 7 of our annual report on form 10‐k for the year ended december 31, 2020, filed with the sec on february 25, 2021.
overview host inc. operates as a self-managed and self-administered reit that owns hotels and conducts operations through host l.p., of which host inc. is the sole general partner and of which it holds approximately 99% of its common op units as of december 31, 2021. the remainder of host l.p.'s common op units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. host inc. has the exclusive and complete responsibility for host l.p.'s day-to-day management and control.
host inc. is the largest lodging reit in nareit's composite index and one of the largest owners of luxury and upper upscale hotels. as of february 17, 2022, we own 80 hotels in the united states, canada and brazil and have minority ownership interests in an additional 10 hotels through joint ventures in the united states and in india. these hotels are operated primarily under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry. most of our hotels are located in central business districts of major cities, near airports and in resort/conference destinations.
our customers fall into three broad groups: transient business, group business and contract business, which accounted for approximately 76%, 19%, and 5%, respectively, of our 2021 room sales. business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels. therefore, we will be significantly more affected by trends in business travel than by trends in leisure demand. however, due to the effects of the covid-19 pandemic, demand during the period april 2020 to present primarily has been driven by leisure customers. for a discussion of our customer categories, see "item 1 business - our customers".
covid-19 impact and response. the covid-19 pandemic has significantly adversely impacted u.s. and global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets beginning in the first quarter of 2020. while many of the restrictive measures put in place in jurisdictions where we own hotels have been lifted, the pandemic continues to have a material adverse effect on operations and future bookings and is expected to continue to have a material negative impact on our financial results and cash flows.
in response to the pandemic, we and our managers, as applicable, have accomplished the following actions:
•reopened all hotels that had suspended operations at the start of the covid-19 pandemic;
•implemented portfolio-wide cost reductions, resulting in a reduction of pro forma hotel operating costs across the portfolio by nearly 40% in 2021, compared to 2019. while we expect that certain initiatives, including modernized brand standards, streamlined operating departments and accelerated adoption of cost-saving technologies, may lead to long-term expense reductions, we also expect hotel operating costs to increase more in line with total revenues over time as hotels continue to transition from their contingency level operational plans to increased staffing and spending levels;
•suspended contributions to certain of our hotels' ff&e escrow accounts through december 31, 2021, which were reinstated beginning in 2022;
•accessed the full $1.5 billion under the revolver portion of the credit facility in 2020, as a precautionary measure in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility, and subsequently repaid $800 million in 2021 and the remainder in 2022, as operations began to recover and we returned to cash flow positive hotel operating results;
•further amended the credit agreement governing our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and two $500 million term loans in 2021. under the amendments, the quarterly-tested financial covenants were waived beginning july 1, 2020 until the required financial statement reporting date for the second quarter of 2022. as a result of improving operations during the year, we were able to exit the waiver period following submission of our september 2021 results, and will be required to meet the modified financial covenants, under the terms of the amendment, through the end of 2022; and
•suspended regular quarterly common cash dividends beginning with the second quarter of 2020 through the fourth quarter of 2021 and stock repurchases until further notice. subsequent to year-end, we announced a regular quarterly dividend of $0.03 on our common stock. all future dividends are subject to approval by the board of directors.
we have not filed for any relief under the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act ("cares act") or the american rescue plan act; however, several of our operators, including hyatt and marriott, have filed for the employee retention credit ("erc") to partially offset the costs of their furloughed hotel employees under title ii of the cares act. benefits received by our operators from the erc related to their employees working at our hotels ultimately benefit us as we bear the expense for the wages and benefits of all persons working at our hotels.
the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the company remains fluid, as does our corporate and property-level response, together with the response of our hotel operators. while vaccination rates have increased during the year, there remains a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the trends and duration of the covid-19 pandemic, including the potential impact of new variants, and we are monitoring developments on an ongoing basis. we, and our hotel managers, may take additional actions in response to future developments.
understanding our performance our revenues and expenses. our hotels are operated by third-party managers under long-term agreements, pursuant to which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each hotel. we provide operating funds, or working capital, which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay wages, utilities, property taxes and other hotel-level expenses. we generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each month, which distribution reflects hotel-level sales less property-level operating expenses (excluding depreciation).
operations from our domestic portfolio account for approximately 99% of our total revenues and 1% relate to our five hotels in canada and brazil. because of the significant adverse impact that the covid-19 pandemic had on our operations during 2020 and 2021, we believe that a better understanding of the revenue mix of our hotels is obtained by providing 2019 revenue percentages. therefore, the following table presents the components of our hotel revenues as a percentage of our total revenues for each of 2021 and 2019:
% of 2021         % of 2019
revenues          revenues
●   rooms revenues. occupancy and average daily room rate are the major drivers of rooms revenues. the business mix of the hotel (group versus transient and retail versus discount business) is a significant driver of room rates.                                                                                                                 64   %            63   %
●   food and beverage revenues. food &amp; beverage revenues consist of revenues from group functions, which may include banquet revenues and audio and visual revenues, as well as outlet revenues from the restaurants and lounges at our hotels.                                                                                                  23   %            30   %
●   other revenues. occupancy, the nature of the hotel (e.g., resort) and its price point are the main drivers of other ancillary revenues, such as attrition and cancellation fees, resort and destination fees, parking, golf courses, spas, entertainment and other guest services. this category also includes other rental revenues.            12   %             7   %

hotel operating expenses represent approximately 97% of our total operating costs and expenses. the following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses:
% of 2021         % of 2019
operating         operating costs and         costs and expenses          expenses
●   rooms expenses. these costs include housekeeping, reservation systems, room supplies, laundry services and front desk costs. occupancy is the major driver of rooms expenses. these costs can increase based on increases in salaries and wages, as well as on the level of service and amenities that are provided.                                                                              16   %            19   %
●   food and beverage expenses. these expenses primarily include food, beverage and the associated labor costs and will correlate closely with food and beverage revenues. group functions with banquet sales and audio and visual components generally will have lower overall costs as a percentage of revenues than outlet sales.                                                                  16   %            24   %
●   other departmental and support expenses. these expenses include labor and other costs associated with other ancillary revenues, such as parking, golf courses, spas, entertainment and other guest services, as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments, allocated brand costs, sales and marketing, repairs and minor maintenance and utility costs.            28   %            28   %
●   management fees. base management fees are computed as a percentage of gross revenues. incentive management fees generally are paid when operating profits exceed certain thresholds.                                                                                                                                                                                                               3   %             5   %
●   other property-level expenses. these expenses consist primarily of real and personal property taxes, ground rent, equipment rent and property insurance. many of these expenses are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels.                                                                                                               10   %             8   %
●   depreciation and amortization expense. this is a non-cash expense that changes primarily based on the acquisition and disposition of hotels and the amounts of historical capital expenditures. this component also can include impairment expense.                                                                                                                                               24   %            14   %
the expense components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statements of operations. it also is worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items. taken separately, these costs represent approximately 55% and 58% of our rooms, food and beverage, and other departmental and support expenses in 2021 and 2019, respectively.
key performance indicators. the following key performance indicators commonly are used in the hospitality industry and we believe provide useful information to management and investors in order to compare our performance with the performance of other lodging reits:
•hotel occupancy is a volume indicator based on the percentage of available room nights that are sold;
•average daily rate ("adr") is a price indicator calculated by dividing rooms revenues by the number of rooms sold;
•revenues per available room ("revpar") is used to evaluate hotel operations. revpar is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved. revpar does not include food and beverage, parking, or other guest service revenues generated by the hotel. although revpar does not include these ancillary revenues, it is considered a key indicator of core revenues for many hotels; and
•total revenues per available room ("total revpar") is a summary measure of hotel results calculated by dividing the sum of rooms, food and beverage and other ancillary services revenues by room nights available to guests for the period. it includes ancillary revenues that are not included in the calculation of revpar.
revpar changes that are driven by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels, as well as incremental operating profit, than do changes that are driven by average room rate. for example, increases in occupancy at a hotel will lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues, such as food and beverage revenues, as well as additional incremental costs (including housekeeping services, utilities and room amenity costs). revpar increases due to higher room rates, however, will not result in additional room-related costs, except those charged as a percentage of revenues. as a result, changes in revpar driven by increases or decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than do changes in revpar caused by occupancy levels.

we also evaluate the performance of our business through certain non-gaap financial measures. each of these non-gaap financial measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to gaap performance measures such as total revenues, operating profit, net income and earnings per share. we provide a more detailed discussion of these non-gaap financial measures, how management uses such measures to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance and a discussion of certain limitations of such measures in "-non-gaap financial measures." our non-gaap financial measures include:
•nareit funds from operations ("ffo") and adjusted ffo per diluted share. we use nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share as supplemental measures of company-wide profitability. nareit adopted ffo to promote an industry-wide measure of reit operating performance. we also adjust nareit ffo for gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, certain acquisition costs, litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business and severance costs outside the ordinary course of business.
•all owned hotel pro forma ebitda. all owned hotel pro forma ebitda measures property-level results before debt service, depreciation and corporate expenses (as this is a property level measure) and is a supplemental measure of aggregate property-level profitability. we use all owned hotel pro forma ebitda and associated margins to evaluate the profitability of our hotels.
•ebitda, ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare. earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") is a supplemental measure of our operating performance and facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging reits, hotel owners who are not reits and other capital-intensive companies. nareit adopted ebitda for real estate ("ebitdare") in order to promote an industry-wide measure of reit operating performance. we also adjust ebitdare for property insurance gains, certain acquisition costs, litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business and severance costs outside the ordinary course of business ("adjusted ebitdare").
in discussing our operating results, we typically present revpar and certain other financial data on a comparable hotel basis. however, due to the covid-19 pandemic and its effects on operations, there is little comparability between years. for this reason, we are temporarily suspending our comparable hotel presentation and instead present hotel operating results for all consolidated hotels and, to facilitate comparisons between periods, we are presenting results on a pro forma basis, including the following adjustments: (1) operating results are presented for all consolidated hotels owned as of december 31, 2021, but do not include the results of operations for properties sold in 2019, 2020 or 2021; and (2) operating results for acquisitions in the current and prior years are reflected for full calendar years, to include results for periods prior to our ownership. for these hotels, since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership, the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results.
summary of 2021 operating results the following table reflects certain line items from our audited consolidated statements of operations and the significant operating statistics for the two years ended december 31, 2021 (in millions, except per share and hotel statistics):

revenues total revenues increased $1,270 million, or 78.4%, compared to 2020, due to strong leisure demand at our resort hotels during the year and the limited return of business and group travel in the second half of the year. all owned hotel pro forma revpar increased 87.6%, compared to 2020, due to a 19.7 basis point increase in occupancy and a 6.8% increase in average room rate. all owned hotel pro forma total revpar increased 74.6% for the year as increases in occupancy led to improved food and beverage revenues (see "statement of operations results and trends").
following unprecedented occupancy declines in 2020, revpar experienced sequential quarterly growth throughout 2021, resulting in year over year revpar improvements in all of our markets and total revpar improvements in all but one market, compared to 2020. while the portfolio as a whole continues to lag 2019 operations, all owned hotel total revpar in our miami market led the portfolio, with an increase of 9.3%, compared to 2019, followed by our jacksonville and maui/oahu markets with decreases of 0.7% and 9.4%, respectively, compared to 2019. the strong relative performance of these markets was driven primarily by continued leisure demand at our resort properties, which has allowed our operators to drive average room rates in excess of 2019 levels. our florida gulf coast and phoenix hotels also outperformed the portfolio, with declines of 12.6% and 17.4%, respectively, compared to 2019. our hotels in san francisco/san jose and new york, our two largest markets by room count, experienced declines of 75.3% and 69.8%, respectively, compared to 2019, due to the slow return of group and business travel at our urban hotels. similarly, our boston and seattle markets continue to lag the portfolio, with declines of 70.6% and 70.4%, respectively, compared to 2019.
operating profit operating trends improved sequentially throughout the year, as vaccine distribution has continued and jurisdictions have lessened covid-19 restrictions. in particular, resort destinations continue to drive the portfolio, with revpar levels that are approaching or exceeding 2019 levels. at the same time, hotel-level operating costs are increasing at lower rates, as hiring did not keep pace with the improvement in operations at these resort destinations. the lag in hiring is due to the challenging labor environment across the industry, which has hindered our managers' ability to adjust staffing levels commensurate with the increase in demand. we anticipate that hotel-level operating costs over time will increase at a higher rate, as our hotel managers adjust back to more normalized levels of operations.
as a result, operating profit (loss) margins (calculated based on gaap operating profit as a percentage of gaap revenues) improved to (8.7)% in 2021, compared to (58.8)% in 2020. operating profit margins under gaap also are affected significantly by several items, including dispositions, depreciation expense and corporate expenses. our all owned hotel pro forma ebitda margins, which exclude these items, improved to 21.7% for the year, up from (7.7)% in 2020.
net income, adjusted ebitdare and adjusted ffo per diluted share net loss for host inc. was reduced by $730 million in 2021 to a loss of $11 million. the improvement was primarily due to improving operations at our hotels, as well as a $98 million increase in other gains, consisting primarily of higher gain on sale of assets in 2021 as compared to 2020. these results led to a diluted loss per common share for host inc. of $0.02. adjusted ebitdare and adjusted ffo per diluted share, which exclude gain on sale of assets, among other items, increased to $532 million and $0.61, respectively, in 2021. operations improved throughout the year, with the fourth quarter being the strongest for each of net income, adjusted ebitdare and adjusted ffo per diluted share.
the trends and transactions described above for host inc. affected similarly the operating results for host l.p., as the only significant difference between the host inc. and host l.p. statements of operations relates to the treatment of income attributable to the unaffiliated limited partners of host l.p.
2022 outlook the covid-19 pandemic continues to severely impact macroeconomic and industry expectations for 2022. while year-over-year growth in real gdp and business investment for 2021 saw a strong rebound from 2020, rising case rates, new virus variants, accelerating inflation and the associated policy response pose ongoing risks in the coming year. blue chip economic indicators consensus currently estimates an increase in real u.s. gdp of 3.7% for 2022, while business investment is anticipated to increase 5.0%. the range of potential outcomes on the economy and the lodging industry specifically remains exceptionally wide, reflecting the unpredictability of new covid-19 variants and varying analyst assumptions surrounding the impact of supply chain disruptions, labor shortages in key industries and inflation expectations.
hotel supply growth is anticipated to remain below the long-term historical average in 2022, as social distancing measures and supply chain challenges have resulted in project delays across the u.s. however, the pandemic has had an outsized impact on our industry demand. as a result, revpar recovery to pre-pandemic levels is lagging that of the broader u.s. economy, despite lower supply growth. luxury and upper upscale hotels in top u.s. markets, where a majority of our hotels are located, have been most heavily affected by the pandemic, due in part to the sharp decline in air travel, particularly from international arrivals, and the slower recovery of corporate and group demand. while we have seen improving trends across all location types, we anticipate that these factors will persist well into 2022.
as a result of the significant uncertainties related to the impact of new virus variants and broader macroeconomic trends in 2022, we anticipate that the industry outlook will continue to be weighed down by the slower return of corporate and group travel, as many businesses and employees remain cautious. while leisure demand drove strong rate growth and revpar improvements at many of our resort properties in 2021, the delayed return to office and slow return of conferences are likely to continue to constrain business transient and group travel in the near term. therefore, the timing and trajectory of the recovery is difficult to forecast due to a wide range of customer responses to vaccines and the virus, seasonal shifts in the mix of business and leisure demand, as well as a condensed booking window for hotel rooms. while we currently anticipate year-over-year revpar growth for 2022, we cannot provide a full year forecast for revpar at this time. we believe that the continued recovery within the lodging industry is highly dependent on the strength of the economy, consumer confidence and the return of corporate and group travel. accordingly, we believe that the impact of the recovery on specific markets and industries will be uneven.
as noted above, the current outlook for the lodging industry remains highly uncertain. there can be no assurances as to the timing for a recovery in lodging demand for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, slower than anticipated return of group and business travel. for more information on the risks that can affect our future results, see part 1 item 1a. "risk factors."
strategic initiatives for 2022, we intend to continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation in order to strengthen our portfolio and to deliver stockholder value through multiple levers, which may include, over time, acquiring hotels or investing in our portfolio. we intend to take advantage of our strong capital position and overall scale to acquire upper-upscale and luxury properties, through single asset or portfolio acquisitions, that we believe have sustainable competitive advantages to drive long-term value to the extent favorable pricing opportunities arise. at the same time, we will opportunistically sell hotels when market conditions permit. we also continue to critically analyze our portfolio to seek to take advantage of the inherent value of our real estate for its highest and best use.
acquisitions. during 2021, we completed the following acquisitions:
•the 448-room hyatt regency austin for $161 million;
•the 444-room four seasons resort orlando at walt disney world® resort for $610 million;
•the royal ka'anapali and ka'anapali kai golf courses, adjacent to our hyatt regency maui hotel, for $28 million;
•the 200-room baker's cay resort key largo, curio collection by hilton, for $200 million;
•a 223-room luxury downtown houston hotel, subsequently rebranded as the laura hotel, part of the autograph collection by marriott, for $65 million;
•the 59-room alila ventana big sur for $150 million;
•the 173-room alida, savannah for $103 million; and
•the 319-room hotel van zandt for approximately $246 million, including $4 million for the ff&e reserve fund. in connection with the acquisition of the hotel van zandt, we assumed a nonrecourse $102 million mortgage loan with a fair value of $105 million.
other investments. subsequent to year-end, we invested an aggregate of $35 million of cash and issued approximately $56 million of host l.p. op units to acquire a non-voting minority equity interest in noble management holdings, llc and noble investment holdings, llc representing 49% of (a) the net fee income of the noble business in respect of existing and future noble investment group funds and other revenue-based activities, (b) 40% of the gross carried interest earned on the funds beginning as of closing, and (c) proceeds received from general partner commitments to future funds. as part of our investment, we have made a $150 million capital commitment to the next noble fund. we also have the opportunity to increase our investment in noble's business. see item 1 - "business "for more information.
dispositions. we completed the sale of six hotels in 2021 for a total price of $748 million, including the purchasers' deposit of $14 million for ff&e replacement funds that were received by the properties at closing. these dispositions included a five-hotel portfolio consisting of the westfields marriott washington dulles, san ramon marriott, the westin buckhead atlanta, the westin los angeles airport, and the whitley, in addition to the w hollywood.
subsequent to year-end, we also sold the sheraton boston hotel for $233 million, which includes $163 million due from the purchaser under a bridge loan.
financing transactions. senior notes. on november 23, 2021, we issued $450 million of 2.9% series j senior notes in an underwritten public offering for proceeds of $439 million, net of discounts, underwriting fees and expenses. the series j senior notes are due in december 2031 and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on june 15 and december 15, commencing june 15, 2022. the proceeds of this issuance were used to redeem our $400 million 3.75% series d senior notes due 2023, including a prepayment premium of $22 million. the series j senior notes have been designated as green bonds, as an amount equal to the net proceeds will be allocated to eligible green projects.
credit facility. in february 2021, we further amended the terms of our credit facility to extend the existing waiver of quarterly-tested financial maintenance covenants until the required financial statement reporting date for the second quarter of 2022. during the year, we exited the waiver period prior to the first scheduled covenant test and will be required to meet the modified financial covenants, under the terms of the amendment, through the end of 2022, after which the covenant levels resort to what they were prior to the amendments. during the year, we also repaid $800 million under the revolver portion of our credit facility and subsequent to year end we repaid the remaining revolver balance.
we believe that our ability to maintain an investment grade balance sheet and well-laddered maturity schedule is an important factor in our investment strategy. as of december 31, 2021, our weighted average interest rate is 3.1% and our weighted average debt maturity is 5.1 years. we have a debt balance of $4.9 billion and no significant debt maturities until 2024. following the repayment of the revolver portion of the credit facility subsequent to year end, the debt balance is $4.2 billion.
for a detailed discussion, see "-liquidity and capital resources." for a detailed discussion of our significant debt activities, see part ii item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data - note 5. debt" in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
capital projects. we continue to pursue opportunities to enhance asset value through select capital improvements, including projects that are designed to increase the eco-efficiency of our hotels, incorporate elements of sustainable design and replace aging equipment and systems with more efficient technology. during 2021, we spent approximately $427 million on capital expenditures, of which $293 million represented return on investment ("roi") capital expenditures and $134 million represented renewal and replacement projects. roi capital projects completed during the year include 19 additional luxury villas at the andaz maui at wailea resort and construction of a 1.5-acre water park at the ritz-carlton naples golf resort.
in addition, hotels in certain regions are subject to weather related events, including hurricanes, wildfires, floods and rising sea levels. to mitigate these physical risks, we complete specific capital expenditure projects, including replacements and restorations of exterior walls, windows, roofs, doors and grounds, and distributed energy systems to further increase the resilience of our hotels. a portion of our capital expenditures for 2021 include these types of projects, which we expect to continue in future years. while the number of projects and overall cost varies from year to year, approximately 5% our capital expenditures have related to these types of projects over the past six years.
we have made substantial progress on the marriott transformational capital program, which began in 2018 and is expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2022, and includes 16 of our hotels. we believe this program will position these hotels to be more competitive in their respective markets and will enhance long-term performance through increases in revpar and market yield index. we agreed to invest amounts in excess of the ff&e reserves required under our management agreements and, in exchange, marriott has provided additional priority returns on the agreed upon investments and operating profit guarantees of up to $83 million, before reductions for incentive management fees, to offset expected business disruption.
approximately 85% of the total estimated costs of the program have been spent as of december 31, 2021. of the 16 hotels included in the program, we have completed projects at the coronado island marriott resort & spa, new york marriott downtown, san francisco marriott marquis, and santa clara marriott in 2019 and projects at the minneapolis marriott city center, san antonio marriott rivercenter and jw marriott atlanta buckhead in 2020. during 2021, we completed the projects at the ritz-carlton amelia island, new york marriott marquis and orlando world center marriott. subsequent to year end, we also completed projects at the houston marriott medical center and marina del rey marriott.
in 2022, we also have several projects apart from the marriott transformational capital program that seek to add value to our existing portfolio over time. these projects include:
•expansions at the orlando world center marriott - development and construction of a 2.3-acre waterpark and a 60,000 gross square-foot meeting space expansion, which is underway and expected to be completed in the first half of 2022;
• the ritz-carlton naples - a tower expansion and extensive guestroom renovation that will increase the number of suites at the property, paired with the redevelopment of public and meeting space, including the addition of a new pool and cabanas, which are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022; and
•fairmont kea lani, maui - extensive estimated $128 million renovation of the guestrooms and the addition of a new arrival experience and lobby bar, with the first of two phases finishing in 2022 and the final phase scheduled for completion in the second quarter of 2023.
for 2022, we expect to make capital expenditures of $500 million to $600 million, including approximately $90 million to $115 million for the marriott transformational capital program discussed above. we received approximately $14 million in operating profit guarantees in 2021 from marriott and expect to receive approximately $11 million in 2022. the total expected capital spend consists of $325 million to $375 million of roi projects and $175 million to $225 million of renewal and replacement projects. we have established key milestones to review major projects prior to implementation, with the ability to reduce 2022 capital expenditures by nearly $100 million, if required, to conserve cash.
dividends. as part of our response to covid-19 and in order to preserve cash and future financial flexibility, we suspended our regular quarterly common cash dividend commencing with the second quarter dividend that would have been paid in july 2020. no dividends were paid in 2021. however, we have re-instated our quarterly dividend beginning with the first quarter of 2022. on february 16, 2022, the board of directors announced a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 on our common stock. the dividend will be paid on april 15, 2022 to stockholders of record on march 31, 2022. the amount of any future dividends will be based on our policy of distributing, over time, 100% of our taxable income and will be determined by host inc.'s board of directors.
there can be no assurances that any future dividends will match or exceed those set forth above for any number of reasons, including a decline in operations or an increase in liquidity needs. we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets in order to fund our capital expenditures programs and to take advantage of investment opportunities.

n/m = not meaningful statement of operations results and trends the following table presents revenues in accordance with gaap for the two years ended december 31, 2021 (in millions, except percentages):
2021            2020               change revenues:
rooms                      $1,858            $976        90.4   %
food and beverage             674             426        58.2
other                         358             218        64.2
total revenues             $2,890          $1,620        78.4
although still well below pre-pandemic levels, revenues in 2021 experienced significant quarterly increases throughout the year. while acquisitions contributed $173 million to revenues for 2021, the majority of the increase from 2020 was due to the ongoing recovery of the lodging industry from the covid-19 pandemic. the pandemic began to significantly impact hotel operations in march of 2020, and after a significant decline in revenues in the second quarter of 2020, revenues have improved through subsequent quarters. our 2021 revenues on a quarterly basis were as follows:
2021
first            second             third            fourth quarter           quarter           quarter           quarter revenues:           $399              $649              $844              $998
rooms. total rooms revenues increased $882 million, or 90.4%, in 2021, as average room rates increased to near pre-pandemic levels during the year.
food and beverage. total f&b revenues increased $248 million, or 58.2%, in 2021, due primarily to strong restaurants and other outlet revenue, which more than doubled compared to 2020.
other revenues. total other revenues increased $140 million, or 64.2%, in 2021, due primarily to strong ancillary revenues.

property-level operating expenses the following table presents consolidated property-level operating expenses in accordance with gaap for the two years ended december 31, 2021 (in millions, except percentages):
2021            2020                change expenses:
rooms                                              $488            $362         34.8   %

other property-level expenses                       307             312         (1.6   )
depreciation and amortization                       762             665         14.6
total property-level operating expenses          $3,049          $2,484         22.7
our operating costs and expenses, which consist of both fixed and variable components, are affected by several factors. rooms expenses are affected mainly by occupancy, which drives costs related to items such as housekeeping, reservation systems, room supplies, laundry services and front desk costs. food and beverage expenses correlate closely with food and beverage revenues and are affected by occupancy and the mix of business between banquet and audio-visual and outlet sales. however, the most significant expense for the rooms, food and beverage, and other departmental and support expenses is wages and employee benefits, which comprise approximately 55% of these expenses in any year. during 2021, these expenses increased 22% compared to 2020, excluding the severance expense discussed below. included in the amount for 2020 was approximately $125 million for benefits to hotel employees who were furloughed by our managers, while in 2021, benefit costs for furloughed employees did not have a significant impact on results, as they were eligible to be reimbursed through the american rescue plan act. wages expense increases were partially offset by approximately $13 million and $39 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to the erc recorded by our managers. we also recorded $65 million of severance costs in 2020, compared to severance reversals of $10 million in 2021. we anticipate wage compression will continue in 2022, particularly in markets that have led the lodging demand recovery. in aggregate, wage and benefit cost inflation is expected to be in the 4% to 5% range in 2022. other property-level expenses consist of property taxes, which are highly dependent on local taxing authorities, and property and general liability insurance, and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels.
the increase in expenses for rooms, food and beverage, other departmental and support, and management fees was generally due to the corresponding increase in revenues from occupancy improvements, as follows:
rooms. rooms expenses increased $126 million, or 34.8%, during 2021. wages and benefits represented approximately 66% of our 2021 rooms expenses and 71% of our 2020 rooms expenses.
food and beverage. f&b expenses increased $85 million, or 20.2%, in 2021. wages and benefits represented approximately 65% of our 2021 f&b expenses and 73% of our 2020 f&b expenses.
other departmental and support expenses. other departmental and support expenses increased $204 million, or 29.7%, in 2021. wages and benefits represented approximately 42% of our 2021 other departmental and support expenses and 44% of our 2020 other departmental and support expenses.
management fees. total management fees increased $58 million, or 148.7%, in 2021. base management fees, which generally are calculated as a percentage of total revenues, increased $38 million, or 82.6%, compared to 2020. incentive management fees, which generally are based on the amount of operating profit at each hotel after we receive a priority return on our investment, increased $20 million, due primarily to the improved operations in our resort properties in 2021.
other property-level expenses. these expenses generally do not vary significantly based on occupancy and include expenses such as property taxes and insurance. other property-level expenses decreased $5 million, or 1.6%, in 2021, primarily due to a decrease in property taxes, partially offset by an increase in property insurance and rent on a portion of our ground leases that are based on a percentage of sales. other property-level expenses were partially offset by the receipt of operating profit guarantees from marriott under the transformational capital program in both 2021 and 2020.
depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization expense increased $97 million, or 14.6%, to $762 million in 2021, due primarily to impairment expense of $92 million in 2021.

general and administrative costs primarily consist of wages and benefits, travel, corporate insurance, legal fees, audit fees, building rent and systems costs. in 2021, corporate and other expenses increased by approximately 11.2% compared to 2020, as a result of increased compensation and legal fees.
interest expense. interest expense decreased $3 million, or 1.5%, in 2021 as compared to 2020, reflecting less prepayment premiums on the repayment of the series d senior notes in 2021 compared to the prepayment premiums paid in 2020 on the series c senior notes, partially offset by an increase in average interest rates. the following table presents certain components of interest expense (in millions):

equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates. in 2021, we recorded earnings of $31 million related to our unconsolidated investments compared to a loss of $30 million in 2020. the 2021 results include improved operations at the affiliates as well as unrealized gains on our investment in fifth wall ventures, l.p, while 2020 results include a $14 million loss for our share of an inventory impairment expense recorded by our maui timeshare joint venture, in addition to operating losses incurred by our affiliates.
benefit for income taxes. we lease substantially all our properties to consolidated subsidiaries designated as trs for u.s. federal income tax purposes. taxable income or loss generated/incurred by the trs primarily represents hotel-level operations and the aggregate rent paid to host l.p. by the trs, on which we record an income tax provision or benefit. in 2021 and 2020, we recorded an income tax benefit of $91 million and $220 million, respectively, due primarily to the domestic net operating loss incurred by our trs. as a result of legislation enacted by the cares act in 2020, a portion of the 2020 domestic net operating loss was carried back to 2017-2019 in order to procure a refund of u.s. federal corporate income taxes previously paid. the remaining portion of the 2020 net operating loss, as well as the entire 2021 net operating loss incurred by our trs, may be carried forward indefinitely, subject to an annual limit on the use thereof of 80% of annual taxable income. see also part ii item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 7. income taxes" for a discussion of our income taxes.

hotel revpar overview to facilitate a year-over-year comparison of our operations, we typically present certain operating statistics for the periods included in this presentation on a comparable hotel basis. however, due to the covid-19 pandemic and its effects on operations, there is little comparability between periods. for this reason, we are revising our presentation to instead present pro forma hotel operating results for all hotels. see "all owned hotel operating statistics" for a complete description of our methodology. we also discuss our hotel revpar results by geographic location and mix of business (i.e., transient, group, or contract).

hotel sales by business mix.
the majority of our customers fall into three broad categories: transient, group and contract business. the information below is derived from business mix results from the 81 hotels owned as of december 31, 2021.
following significant occupancy declines in 2020, the 2021 recovery has been driven primarily by strong leisure transient demand. however, group demand showed significant improvement during the second half of 2021, compared to the first half of the year. the following are the results of our consolidated portfolio transient, group and contract business:

liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources of host inc. and host l.p. the liquidity and capital resources of host inc. and host l.p. are derived primarily from the activities of host l.p., which generates the capital required by our business from hotel operations, the incurrence of debt, the issuance of op units or the sale of hotels. host inc. is a reit and its only significant asset is the ownership of general and limited partner interests of host l.p.; therefore, its financing and investing activities are conducted through host l.p., except for the issuance of its common and preferred stock. proceeds from common and preferred stock issuances by host inc. are contributed to host l.p. in exchange for common and preferred op units. additionally, funds used by host inc. to pay dividends or to repurchase its stock are provided by host l.p. therefore, while we have noted those areas in which it is important to distinguish between host inc. and host l.p., we have not included a separate discussion of liquidity and capital resources as the discussion below applies to both host inc. and host l.p.
overview. we look to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of cash, debt and equity to provide financial flexibility given the inherent volatility of the lodging industry. we believe this strategy has resulted in a better cost of debt capital, allowing us to complete opportunistic investments and acquisitions and it positions us to manage potential declines in

operations throughout the lodging cycle. we have structured our debt profile to maintain a balanced maturity schedule and to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt. currently, only one of our consolidated hotels is encumbered by mortgage debt. over the past several years leading up to the covid-19 pandemic, we had decreased our leverage as measured by our net debt-to-ebitda ratio and reduced our debt service obligations, leading to an increase in our fixed charge coverage ratio. as a result, the company was well positioned at the onset of the covid-19 pandemic with sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to withstand the severe slowdown in u.s. economic activity and lodging demand brought on by the pandemic. we were able to take further steps in 2021 to bolster our liquidity position as outlined below.
under the current challenging operating environment posed by the covid-19 pandemic, we have taken steps to preserve liquidity by working with our hotel operators to reduce operating costs at the hotels, closely monitoring our capital expenditures levels, and temporarily suspending our quarterly dividend and stock repurchases. as hotel operations have returned to cash flow positive and having met our required senior notes financial covenant levels in the third quarter of 2021, which reinstated our ability to issue debt, we repaid $800 million in 2021 of the $1.5 billion originally drawn under the revolver portion of our credit facility in 2020 to bolster our liquidity position at the onset of the pandemic and repaid the remaining amount in 2022. the repaid amount can be re-borrowed at any time, subject to the requirements of the credit facility. in 2021, we also refinanced $400 million of senior note debt, through the issuance of $450 million series j senior notes, extending our nearest significant debt maturity to 2024. we utilized approximately $1.5 billion of cash during the year to fund the acquisition of seven properties and land, while also generating approximately $729 million by the sale of six hotels. subsequent to year-end, we also sold the sheraton boston for $233 million, which includes $163 million due from the purchaser under a bridge loan.
we intend to use available cash in the near term predominantly to fund, and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to fund, our corporate expenses, capital expenditures, hotel acquisitions and remaining hotels with negative operations. we may access equity markets if favorable conditions exist in order to enhance our liquidity and to fund cash needs, including to fund additional acquisitions or other investment opportunities generated by the covid-19 pandemic. the following summarizes the change in cash flows from 2020 to 2021 for significant items that affected our cash balance and reflects our actions to preserve financial liquidity:

cash requirements. we use cash for acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt payments, operating costs, and corporate and other expenses, as well as for dividends and distributions to stockholders and host l.p. limited partners and stock and op unit repurchases. our primary sources of cash include cash from operations, proceeds from the sale of assets, borrowings under our credit facility and debt and equity issuances. in the short term, our cash obligations include the minimum lease payments on our ground leases, which in 2022 are approximately $31 million, and most of our other operating obligations. in the long term, our ground lease payments are the longest time horizon obligations and currently run up to 90 years. for a summary of our obligations under our ground leases, see exhibit 99.1 to this annual report. we have no significant debt maturities until 2024. for our long-term senior note and credit facility obligations, we historically have refinanced these amounts prior to their maturity through the issuance of new senior notes or new credit facility agreements.
in addition to the liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, under our capital expenditures program, we have budgeted to spend $500 million to $600 million in 2022, but have the ability to reduce this spend by approximately $100 million if required to conserve cash. commitments for capital expenditures generally run less than two years for the life of the project. in the long term, renewal and replacement capital expenditures are designed to maintain the quality and competitiveness of our hotels and typically occur at intervals of seven to ten years. the projects are primarily funded through the ff&e reserves established at each hotel. average annual r&r spend over the last five years has been $198 million.
as a reit, host inc. is required to pay dividends to its stockholders in an amount equal to at least 90% of its taxable income, excluding net capital gain, on an annual basis. as part of our covid-19 response, our regular quarterly common cash dividend was temporarily suspended. see also part ii item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 17. legal proceedings, guarantees and contingencies" for a discussion of obligations under contingent liabilities or guarantees.
capital resources. as of december 31, 2021, we had $807 million of cash and cash equivalents, $144 million in our ff&e escrow reserve and $812 million available under the revolver portion of our credit facility. subsequent to year end, we repaid the remaining amounts outstanding under the revolver portion of our credit facility. in the near term, we expect to fund our above cash requirements, including our capital expenditures program, debt service, operating and corporate costs, primarily through hotel operations and our existing cash reserves. based on our cash balance at december 31, 2021 and our expected cash obligations, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our near-term obligations, even if certain of our hotel operations remain at negative operating levels. future acquisitions and/or obligations may also be funded through a draw on the available portion of the revolver under our credit facility, equity issuances, or asset sales.
we depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth, including acquisitions. as a result, the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure. our financial flexibility (including our ability to incur debt, pay dividends, make distributions and make investments) is contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility and senior notes, which include, among other things, the allowable amounts of leverage, interest coverage and fixed charges. following our exit of the covenant waiver period under the amendments of our credit facility agreement discussed below, we resumed quarterly-testing of our financial covenants under the agreed-upon modified terms.
given the total amount of our debt and our maturity schedule, we may continue to redeem or repurchase senior notes from time to time, taking advantage of favorable market conditions. in february 2021, host inc.'s board of directors authorized repurchases of up to $1.0 billion of senior notes other than in accordance with their respective terms, of which the entire amount remains available under this authority. we may purchase senior notes for cash through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, a tender offer or, in some cases, through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms. repurchases of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. any retirement before the maturity date will affect earnings and nareit ffo per diluted share as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the accelerated expensing of previously deferred and capitalized financing costs. accordingly, considering our priorities in managing our capital structure and liquidity profile and given prevailing conditions and relative pricing in the capital markets, we may, at any time, subject to applicable securities laws and the requirements of our credit facility and senior notes, be considering, or be in discussions with respect to, the repurchase or issuance of exchangeable debentures and/or senior notes or the repurchase or sale of our common stock. any such transactions may, subject to applicable securities laws, occur simultaneously.
two programs are currently in place relating to purchases and sales of our common stock. first, in february 2017, host inc.'s board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $500 million of host inc. common stock, and on august 5, 2019, authorized an increase in the program to $1 billion. the common stock may be purchased from time to time depending upon market conditions and may be purchased in the open market or through private transactions or by other means, including principal transactions with various financial institutions, like accelerated share repurchases, forwards, options, and similar transactions and through one or more trading plans designed to comply with rule 10b5-1 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. the plan does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number or any specific dollar amount of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. at december 31, 2021, we had $371 million available for repurchase under the program. however, purchases were temporarily restricted under the terms of our credit facility amendment and there have been no repurchases during 2021.
second, on may 6, 2021, we entered into a distribution agreement with j. p. morgan securities llc, bofa securities, inc., btig, llc, goldman sachs & co. llc, morgan stanley & co. llc, scotia capital (usa) inc., truist securities, inc. and wells fargo securities, llc, as sales agents, through which host inc. may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $600 million. the shares can be offered and sold through sales agents in transactions that are deemed to be "at the market" offerings at then-current market prices. we are not obligated to issue any shares and may do so when we believe conditions are advantageous and there is a compelling use of proceeds, including to fund future potential acquisitions or other investment opportunities generated by the covid-19 pandemic. in 2021, we issued approximately 7.8 million shares under the program at an average price of $17.99 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $138 million, net of $2 million of commissions. there were no issuances in the fourth quarter of 2021. as of december 31, 2021, there was $460 million of remaining capacity under the agreement.
we continue to explore potential acquisitions and dispositions. we anticipate that any such future acquisitions will be funded primarily by proceeds from sales of hotels, but also potentially from equity offerings of host inc., issuances of op units by host l.p., or available cash. given the nature of these transactions, we can make no assurances that we will be successful in acquiring any one or more hotels that we may review, bid on or negotiate to purchase or that we will be successful in disposing of any one or more of our hotels. we may acquire additional hotels or dispose of hotels through various structures, including transactions involving single assets, portfolios, joint ventures, acquisitions of the securities or assets of other reits or distributions of hotels to our stockholders.
sources and uses of cash. in 2021, our primary sources of cash included proceeds from the issuance of debt, issuances under our at-the-market equity program and proceeds from asset sales. our primary uses of cash during the year consisted of acquisitions, capital expenditures, operating costs, and debt repayments. we anticipate that our sources and uses of cash will be similar in 2022, with an increased amount of cash provided by operations, as operations at our hotels are expected to continue to improve, and the use of cash for the reinstatement of common dividends and common distributions.
cash provided by/used in operations. our net cash provided by operations for 2021 was $292 million compared to cash used in operations in 2020 of $307 million as we experienced a return to positive cash flow from our hotel operations in 2021, while 2020 primarily represented the need to fund operating shortfalls at our properties. following the trend from 2020, in 2021, net cash used in operations improved in each sequential quarter as a result of the improving levels of operations, turning to positive cash from operating activities in the second quarter. the following presents the net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for each quarter in 2021:

cash provided by/used in investing activities. approximately $1,158 million of cash was used in investing activities during 2021 compared to $195 million in 2020. in addition to the acquisition and disposition activity detailed in the charts below, we spent approximately $427 million on capital expenditures in 2021, compared to $499 million in 2020. these amounts include certain internal costs and interest expense associated with our capital expenditures projects that have been capitalized in accordance with gaap. these capitalized costs were $13 million, $12 million and $12 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

(1) in february 2022, we repaid the remaining $683 million outstanding on the credit facility revolver that was due in 2024.
senior notes. on november 23, 2021, we issued $450 million of 2.9% series j senior notes in an underwritten public offering for proceeds of $439 million, net of discounts, underwriting fees and expenses. the series j senior notes are due in december 2031 and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on june 15 and december 15, commencing june 15, 2022. the proceeds of this issuance were used to redeem our $400 million 3.75% series d senior notes due 2023, including a prepayment premium of $22 million. the series j senior notes are not redeemable prior to 90 days before the december 15, 2031 maturity date, except at a price
51
equal to 100% of their principal amount plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date. the series j senior notes have covenants similar to all other series of our outstanding senior notes.
the following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indenture governing the various senior notes issued by host l.p. we pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes semi-annually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above. under the terms of our senior notes indenture, our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of host l.p.'s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of host l.p. currently there are no guarantees provided with respect to the senior notes, but we have agreed that all host l.p. subsidiaries which guarantee other host l.p. debt must similarly provide guarantees with respect to the senior notes.
all of our outstanding senior notes at december 31, 2021 were issued after we attained an investment grade rating and have covenants customary for investment grade debt and covenants that are similar to each other series of our senior notes. these covenants are primarily limitations on our ability to incur additional debt. there are no restrictions on our ability to pay dividends.
under the terms of our senior notes, host l.p.'s ability to incur debt is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions, including the achievement of an ebitda-to-interest coverage ratio of at least 1.5x by host l.p. as calculated, this ratio excludes from interest expense items such as call premiums and deferred financing charges that are included in interest expense on host l.p.'s audited consolidated statement of operations. in addition, the calculation is based on host l.p.'s pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters, giving effect to certain transactions, such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings, as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. other covenants limiting host l.p.'s ability to incur debt include maintaining total debt of less than 65% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values), maintaining secured debt of less than 40% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values) and maintaining total unencumbered assets of at least 150% of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding unsecured debt of host l.p. and its subsidiaries. so long as host l.p. maintains the required level of interest coverage and satisfies these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture, it may incur additional debt.
the following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the senior notes indenture for our senior notes and our actual credit ratios as of december 31, 2021:
actual ratio       covenant requirement unencumbered assets tests                          426   %   minimum ratio of 150%
total indebtedness to total assets                  24   %   maximum ratio of 65%
secured indebtedness to total assets                 1   %   maximum ratio of 40%
ebitda-to-interest coverage ratio                  3.8   x   minimum ratio of 1.5x as of december 31, 2021, we have met the minimum financial covenant levels under our senior notes indentures. during part of 2021, we were below the 1.5x requirement for the ebitda-to-interest coverage ratio and, as a result, while not in default, we were not able to incur additional debt while the ratio was below this requirement. beginning as of september 30, 2021, we met the minimum financial covenant levels, which reinstated our ability to incur additional debt so long as we maintain these covenant levels and subject to the provisions of our credit facility and senior notes indentures.
credit facility. on august 1, 2019, we entered into the fifth amended and restated senior revolving credit and term loan facility, with bank of america, n.a., as administrative agent, jpmorgan chase bank, n.a and wells fargo bank, n.a. as co-syndication agents, and certain other agents and lenders. the credit facility allows for revolving borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.5 billion. the revolver also includes a foreign currency subfacility for canadian dollars, australian dollars, euros, british pounds sterling and, if available to the lenders, mexican pesos, of up to the foreign currency equivalent of $500 million, subject to a lower amount in the case of mexican peso borrowings. the credit facility also provides for a term loan facility of $1 billion (which is fully utilized), a subfacility of up to $100 million for swingline borrowings in currencies other than u.s. dollars and a subfacility of up to $100 million for issuances of letters of credit. host l.p. also has the option to add in the future $500 million of commitments which may be used for additional revolving credit facility borrowings and/or term loans, subject to obtaining additional loan commitments (which we have not currently obtained) and the satisfaction of certain conditions.
the revolving credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity date of january 11, 2024, which date may be extended by up to a year by the exercise of up to two 6-month extension options, each of which is subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee and the accuracy of representations and warranties. one $500 million term loan tranche has an initial maturity date of january 11, 2024, which date may be extended up to a year by the exercise of one 1-year extension option, which is subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee; and the second $500 million term loan tranche has a maturity date of january 9, 2025, which date may not be extended.
neither the revolving credit facility nor the term loans, as applicable, requires any scheduled amortization payments prior to maturity. the term loans are subject to the same terms and conditions as those in the credit facility regarding subsidiary guarantees, operational covenants, financial covenants and events of default (as discussed below).
guarantees. similar to our senior note indenture, the credit facility requires all host l.p. subsidiaries which guaranty host l.p. debt to similarly guarantee obligations under the credit facility. currently, there are no such guarantees.
prepayments. voluntary prepayments of revolver borrowings and term loans under the credit facility are permitted in whole or in part without premium or penalty.
financial covenants. the credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage. we are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda ("leverage ratio") is not in excess of 7.25x, our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than 1.75x and our fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than 1.25x. except as set forth below, these calculations are performed based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters, giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. under the terms of the credit facility, interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility, and non-cash interest expense, all of which are included in interest expense on our audited consolidated statements of operations. additionally, total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a "net debt" concept, pursuant to which cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million are deducted from our total debt balance.
amendments. on june 26, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the credit facility and on february 9, 2021, we entered into a second amendment to the credit facility (collectively, the "amendments"). the amendments suspended requirements to comply with all existing financial maintenance covenants under the credit facility for the period which began on july 1, 2020 and ended when we exited the covenant waiver period after reporting results for the third quarter of 2021. upon reinstatement, instead of using the prior four calendar quarters' results in the calculations of the required financial maintenance covenants, only results for the exit quarter and thereafter are used during a phase in period. in addition, for the first testing quarter after the covenant waiver period (i.e., the quarter ended september 30, 2021), the only financial covenant that was required to be satisfied was a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00:1.00 as of the end of the quarter. for the fiscal quarters ending after the covenant waiver period (i.e., after september 30, 2021), the financial covenant requirements set forth in the credit facility before the amendments apply, except that the maximum leverage ratio requirement will be amended to be (a) 8.50:1:00 as at the end of the first and second fiscal quarters ending after the covenant waiver period, (b) 8.00:1.00 as at the end of the third and fourth fiscal quarters ending after the covenant waiver period, (c) 7.50:1:00 as at the end of the fifth fiscal quarter ending after the covenant waiver period, and (d) 7.25:1.00 at all times thereafter.
the amendments also provide for, among other things:
•the addition of a permanent libor floor of 15 basis points applicable to borrowings under the revolver and the term facilities; and
•limitations on the ability to make stock repurchases or op unit redemptions following the covenant waiver period if the leverage ratio exceeds 7.25:1.00, subject to certain exceptions.
the amendments also provided for an increase in interest rate spreads, minimum liquidity requirements and limitations on acquisitions, distributions and capital expenditures. these additional restrictions are no longer applicable following our exit from the covenant waiver period as of the reporting date for the third quarter 2021.
in connection with each amendment, we paid a consent fee of 7.5 basis points on the amount of each consenting lender's commitments under the revolver and term facilities.
at december 31, 2021, the following table summarizes the results of the financial tests required by the credit facility, which are calculated on a trailing twelve month basis, for informational purposes only, as the covenant levels are currently calculated using the phase in period and the modified covenant levels described above:
actual ratio       covenant requirement for all years leverage ratio                                     7.18   x   maximum ratio of 7.25x fixed charge coverage ratio                         3.6   x   minimum ratio of 1.25x unsecured interest coverage ratio (1)               4.4   x   minimum ratio of 1.50x
___________
(1) if at any time our leverage ratio is below 7.0x, our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio requirement will increase to 1.75x.
at december 31, 2021, the following table summarizes the results of the financial tests required under the credit facility utilizing annualized third and fourth quarter 2021 results applicable for the phase-in period (in contrast to the ratios calculated above, which are based on the trailing twelve months) and using the modified covenant levels set forth in the amendments and as described above:
actual ratio       covenant requirement for most recent quarter leverage ratio                                      4.7   x   maximum ratio of 8.5x fixed charge coverage ratio                         5.8   x   minimum ratio of 1.25x unsecured interest coverage ratio (1)               6.4   x   minimum ratio of 1.75x
___________
(1) if at any time our leverage ratio is above 7.0x, our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio requirement will decrease to 1.5x.
interest and fees. we pay interest on revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates equal to libor plus a margin. the margin ranges from 77.5 to 145 basis points (depending on host l.p.'s unsecured long-term debt rating). we also pay a facility fee ranging from 12.5 to 30 basis points, depending on our rating and regardless of usage. based on host l.p.'s unsecured long-term debt rating as of december 31, 2021, we are able to borrow at a rate of libor plus 110 basis points and pay a facility fee of 25 basis points. interest on the term loans consists of floating rates equal to libor plus a margin ranging from 85 to 165 basis points (depending on host l.p.'s unsecured long-term debt rating). based on host l.p.'s long-term debt rating as of december 31, 2021, our applicable margin on libor loans under both term loans is 125 basis points.
borrowings under our revolver ($683 million at december 31, 2021) and the $1 billion outstanding in term loans constitute our primary obligations denominated in libor. the united kingdom's financial conduct authority, which regulates libor, announced that it intends to phase out libor over time. in march of 2021, the uk financial conduct authority (fca) published a statement confirming that all libor settings will either cease to be provided or no longer be representative (i) immediately after december 31, 2021, in the case of all sterling, euro, swiss franc and japanese yen settings, and the 1-week and 2-month u.s. dollar settings and (ii) immediately after june 30, 2023, in the case of all other remaining u.s. dollar settings. accordingly, libor for the primary libor rates under our credit facility will be discontinued after june 30, 2023, and, until our credit facility is modified to provide for a specific benchmark replacement, it is unclear what rate will apply to our credit facility debt. as such, the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined. our credit facility provides that in the event libor no longer is published, we and bank of america, n.a., as administrative agent, will amend the credit facility to provide for a comparable successor rate or, in the absence of an amendment, borrowings will be deemed converted to base rate borrowings at the higher of the federal funds rate plus 1⁄2 of 1% or the "prime rate" announced by bank of america, n.a.
other covenants and events of default. the credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters. certain covenants are less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x. at any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x, acquisitions, investments, dividends and distributions generally are permitted except where they would result in a breach of the financial covenants, calculated on a pro forma basis. additionally, the credit facility's restrictions on incurrence of debt incorporate the same financial covenant as set forth in our senior notes indenture.
the credit facility also includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature, and provides that, upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, payment of all amounts due under the credit facility may be accelerated and the lenders' commitments may be terminated. in addition, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts due under the credit facility automatically will become due and payable and the lenders' commitments automatically will terminate.
mortgage debt, including unconsolidated joint ventures. at december 31, 2021, we own one consolidated property that is encumbered by mortgage debt. all of our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets, except in instances of fraud, misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions. as of december 31, 2021, our mortgage debt has an interest rate of 4.67% and matures in 2027, with principal and interest payments due monthly. we also own non-controlling interests in joint ventures that are not consolidated and that are accounted for under the equity method. the portion of the mortgage and other debt of these joint ventures attributable to us, based on our ownership percentage thereof, was $144 million at december 31, 2021. the debt of our unconsolidated joint ventures is non-recourse to us.
distributions/dividends. host inc.'s policy on common dividends generally is to distribute, over time, at least 100% of its taxable income, which primarily is dependent on our results of operations, as well as on tax gains and losses on hotel sales. after paying its regular quarterly common cash dividend of $0.20 per share for the first quarter of 2020, host inc. temporarily suspended its regular quarterly common cash dividend in order to preserve cash and future financial flexibility in response to the covid-19 pandemic. a quarterly common cash dividend of $0.03 was reinstated beginning with the first quarter of 2022. any future dividend will be subject to approval by host inc.'s board of directors.
funds used by host inc. to pay dividends are provided by distributions from host l.p. as of december 31, 2021, host inc. is the owner of approximately 99% of host l.p.'s common op units. the remaining common op units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. each op unit may be offered for redemption by the limited partners for cash or, at the election of host inc., host inc. common stock based on the then current conversion ratio. the current conversion ratio is 1.021494 shares of host inc. common stock for each op unit. under the credit facility, as amended, all redemptions must be made with host inc. common stock if host l.p.'s leverage ratio exceeds 7.25x calculated using the prior twelve-month results.
investors should consider the 1% non-controlling position of host l.p. op units when analyzing dividend payments by host inc. to its stockholders, as these holders of op units share, on a pro rata basis, in amounts being distributed by host l.p. to holders of its op units. for example, if host inc. paid a $1 per share dividend on its common stock, it would be based on the payment of a $1.021494 per common op unit distribution by host l.p. to host inc., as well as to the other common op unitholders.
counterparty credit risk. we are subject to counterparty credit risk, which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price. we assess the ability of our counterparties to fulfill their obligations to determine the impact, if any, of counterparty bankruptcy or insolvency on our financial condition. we are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions and access to our credit facility. we believe our credit exposure in each of these cases is limited, as the credit risk is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions.
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the impairment of long-lived assets, on an ongoing basis. we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. all our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. for a detailed discussion of the critical accounting policy related to impairment testing on our property and equipment, which requires us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates, see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 1. summary of significant accounting policies".
all owned hotel operating statistics and results to facilitate a year-over-year comparison of our operations, we typically present certain operating statistics (i.e., total revpar, revpar, average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues, expenses, hotel ebitda and associated margins) for the periods included in this annual report on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. however, due to the covid-19 pandemic and its effects on operations, there is little comparability between periods. for this reason, we temporarily are suspending our comparable hotel presentation and instead present hotel operating results for all consolidated hotels and, to facilitate comparisons between periods, we are presenting results on a pro forma basis, including the following adjustments: (1) operating results are presented for all consolidated hotels owned as of december 31, 2021, but do not include the results of operations for properties sold through the reporting date; and (2) operating results for acquisitions as of december 31, 2021 are reflected for full calendar years, to include results for periods prior to our ownership. for these hotels, since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership, the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results.
foreign currency translation operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction, or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. therefore, hotel statistics and results for non-u.s. properties include the effect of currency fluctuations, consistent with our financial statement presentation.
non-gaap financial measures we use certain "non-gaap financial measures," which are measures of our historical financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, within the meaning of applicable sec rules. these measures are as follows: (i) ebitda, ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare as a measure of performance for host inc. and host l.p., (ii) funds from operations ("ffo") and ffo per diluted share (both nareit and adjusted), as a measure of performance for host inc., and (iii) all owned hotel pro forma operating results, as a measure of performance for host inc. and host l.p.
we calculate ebitdare and nareit ffo per diluted share in accordance with standards established by nareit, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the nareit definition of ebitdare and ffo or do not calculate ffo per diluted share in accordance with nareit guidance. in addition, although ebitdare and ffo per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other reits, they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-reits. we also calculate adjusted ffo per diluted share and adjusted ebitdare, which measures are not in accordance with nareit guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other reits or by other companies. this information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with gaap. cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures), interest expense (for ebitda, ebitdare, and adjusted ebitdare purposes only) severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been, and will be, made and are not reflected in the ebitda, ebitdare, adjusted ebitdare, nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share presentations. management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-gaap financial measures. additionally, nareit ffo per diluted share, adjusted ffo per diluted share, ebitda, ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare should not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. in addition, nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share do not measure, and should not be used as measures of, amounts that accrue directly to stockholders' benefit.
similarly, ebitdare, adjusted ebitdare, nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and nareit ffo and adjusted ffo include adjustments for non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in seven domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 10 hotels and a vacation ownership development. due to the voting rights of the outside owners, we do not control and, therefore, do not consolidate these entities. the non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in host l.p. held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in one hotel for which we do control the entity and, therefore, consolidate its operations. these pro rata results for nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share, ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare are calculated as set forth below. readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic consequences of our investments in these entities. the following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance.
ebitda, ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare ebitda earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. management believes ebitda provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). management also believes the use of ebitda facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging reits, hotel owners who are not reits and other capital-intensive companies. management uses ebitda to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and, like ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share, it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for compensation programs.
ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare we present ebitdare in accordance with nareit guidelines, as defined in its september 2017 white paper "earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate," to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of our results with other reits. nareit defines ebitdare as net income (calculated in accordance with gaap) excluding interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control), impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity's pro rata share of ebitdare of unconsolidated affiliates.
we make additional adjustments to ebitdare when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitdare, when combined with the primary gaap presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investor's understanding of our operating performance. adjusted ebitdare also is similar to what is used in calculating certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. we adjust ebitdare for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as adjusted ebitdare:
•property insurance gains - we exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in adjusted ebitdare is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. in addition, property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.
•acquisition costs - under gaap, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. we exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company.
•litigation gains and losses - we exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under gaap that we consider outside the ordinary course of business. we believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.
•severance expense - effective for 2020, in certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. situations that would result in a severance add-back include, but are not limited to: (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. we do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.
in unusual circumstances, we also may adjust ebitdare for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the company's current operating performance. the last such adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.
the following table provides a reconciliation of ebitda, ebitdare, and adjusted ebitdare to net income (loss), the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap that we consider the most directly comparable:

___________
(1)net loss, ebitda, ebitdare, adjusted ebitdare, nareit ffo and adjusted ffo for the year ended december 31, 2020 include a gain of $59 million from the sale of land adjacent to the phoenician hotel and a loss of $14 million related to inventory impairment expense recorded by our maui timeshare joint venture, reflected through equity in (earnings) losses of affiliates.
(2)reflects the sale of six hotels in 2021 and one hotel in 2020.
(3)pro rata ebitdare of equity investments and pro rata ffo of equity investments for the year ended december 31, 2021 include a realized gain of approximately $3 million related to equity securities held by one of our unconsolidated partnerships, fifth wall ventures, l.p. unrealized gains of our unconsolidated investments are not recognized in our ebitdare, adjusted ebitdare, nareit ffo or adjusted ffo until they have been realized by the unconsolidated partnership.
ffo measures we present nareit ffo and nareit ffo per diluted share as non-gaap measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with gaap). we calculate nareit ffo per diluted share as our nareit ffo (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period, as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with nareit guidelines. effective january 1, 2019, we adopted nareit's definition of ffo included in nareit's funds from operations white paper - 2018 restatement. the adoption did not result in a change in the way we calculate nareit ffo. nareit defines ffo as net income (calculated in accordance with gaap) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the ffo of those entities on the same basis.
we believe that nareit ffo per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of nareit ffo per diluted share, when combined with the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share, provides beneficial information to investors. by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation, amortization, impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance, we believe such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other reits, even though nareit ffo per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. as noted by nareit in its funds from operations white paper - 2018 restatement, the primary purpose for including ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a reit is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by gaap. for these reasons, nareit adopted the ffo metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of reit operating performance.
we also present adjusted ffo per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance, in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. we believe that the presentation of adjusted ffo per diluted share, when combined with both the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share and ffo per diluted share as defined by nareit, provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor's understanding of our operating performance. we adjust nareit ffo per diluted share for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as adjusted ffo per diluted share:
•gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt - we exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt, including the acceleration of the write off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. we also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. we believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.
•acquisition costs -under gaap, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. we exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company.
•litigation gains and losses - we exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under gaap that we consider outside the ordinary course of business. we believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.
•severance expense - in certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. situations that would result in a severance add back include, but are not limited to: (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. we do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.
in unusual circumstances, we also may adjust nareit ffo for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of our current operating performance. for example, in 2017, as a result of the reduction of the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the tax cuts and jobs act, we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. we do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and, therefore, we excluded this item from adjusted ffo.
the following table provides a reconciliation of the differences between our non-gaap financial measures, nareit ffo and adjusted ffo (separately and on a per diluted share basis), and net income (loss), the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap that we consider most directly comparable:

all owned hotel pro forma property level operating results we present certain operating results for our hotels, such as hotel revenues, expenses, food and beverage profit, and ebitda (and the related margins), on a hotel-level pro forma basis as supplemental information for our investors. our hotel results reflect the operating results of our hotels as discussed in "all owned hotel operating statistics and results" above. we present all owned hotel ebitda to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our hotels after removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. we believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our hotels. all owned hotel results are presented both by location and for our properties in the aggregate. we eliminate from our hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business, as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor's understanding of our ongoing operating performance. we also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because, even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses, these non-cash expenses, which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets, implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. as noted earlier, because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.
because of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses, gains or losses on disposition, certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense, the hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues, expenses, operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.
while management believes that presentation of all owned hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance, this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels, as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on all owned hotel results in the aggregate. for these reasons, we believe all owned hotel operating results, when combined with the presentation of gaap operating profit, revenues and expenses, provide useful information to investors and management.

(1)profit margins are calculated by dividing the applicable operating profit by the related revenue amount. gaap operating profit margins are calculated using amounts presented in the consolidated statements of operations. comparable hotel margins are calculated using amounts presented in the above table.
(2)pro forma adjustments represent the following items: (i) the elimination of results of operations of hotels sold as of december 31, 2021, which operations are included in our consolidated statements of operations as continuing operations and (ii) the addition of results for periods prior to our ownership for hotels acquired as of december 31, 2021. all owned hotel pro forma results also includes the results of our leased office buildings and other non-hotel revenue and expense items.
(3)the ac hotel scottsdale north is a new development hotel that opened in january 2021 and the laura hotel in houston re-opened under new management in november 2021. therefore, no adjustments were made for results of these hotels for periods prior to their openings. results for the hotel sold subsequent to year end are included, as it was owned for the entirety of the periods presented.

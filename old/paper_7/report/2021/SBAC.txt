item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. the following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in item 1a. risk factors. our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. see "special note regarding forward-looking statements" and item 1a. risk factors.
we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure, including tower structures, rooftops, and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications, which we collectively refer to as "towers" or "sites." our principal operations are in the united states and its territories. in addition, we own and operate towers in south america, central america, canada, south africa, the philippines and, effective january 4, 2022, tanzania. our primary business line is our site leasing business, which contributed 97.4% of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31, 2021. in our site leasing business, we (1) lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers that we own or operate and (2) manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. as of december 31, 2021, we owned 34,177 towers, a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who, like us, have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers. in addition, on january 4, 2022, we closed on 1,445 towers under our previously announced deal in tanzania. our other business line is our site development business, through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks.
site leasing our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multi-tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under long-term lease contracts in the united states, south america, central america, canada, south africa, the philippines and, effective january 4, 2022, tanzania. as of december 31, 2021, no u.s. state or territory accounted for more than 10% of our total tower portfolio by tower count, and no u.s. state or territory accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2021. in addition, as of december 31, 2021, approximately 30% of our total towers are located in brazil and no other international markets (each country is considered a market) represented more than 4% of our total towers. we derive site leasing revenues primarily from wireless service provider tenants, including t-mobile, at&t, verizon wireless, oi s.a., telefonica, claro, tigo, tim, and dish wireless. wireless service providers enter into tenant leases with us, each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual site.
in the united states and our international markets, our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years to 15 years with multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant. in canada and in our central american markets, tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators, which average 3-4% per year, including the renewal option periods. in our south american markets, south africa, and the philippines, tenant leases typically escalate annually in accordance with an inflationary index. in tanzania, tenant leases typically escalate using a combination of fixed and inflation adjusted escalators. site leases in our south american markets typically provide for a fixed rental amount and a pass through charge for the underlying rent related to ground leases and other property interests. in south africa, our site leases contain pass through charges related to utilities and, in tanzania, our site leases include components related to utilities and fuel. the utility and fuel portion of our tanzanian site leases adjust periodically in accordance with changes in diesel fuel and electricity prices. in certain markets such as brazil, tenant leases are typically governed by master lease agreements, which provide for the material terms and conditions that will govern the terms of the use of the site.
cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of:
•cash and non-cash rental expense on ground leases and other underlying property interests;
•property taxes;
•site maintenance and monitoring costs (exclusive of employee related costs);
•utilities;
•property insurance;
•fuel (in those international markets that do not have an available electric grid at our tower sites); and
•lease initial direct cost amortization.
in the united states and our international markets, ground leases and other property interests are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal periods, which are at our option. in our central american markets, canada, and the philippines, ground leases and other property interests provide for fixed rent escalators which typically average 2-3% annually, and in our south american markets and south africa, ground leases adjust in accordance with an inflationary index. as of december 31, 2021, approximately 72% of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own, land subject to perpetual easements, or parcels of land in which we have a leasehold interest that extends beyond 20 years. for any given tower, costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period. as such, operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase as a result of adding additional customers to the tower. the amount of property taxes varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower. the ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems, painting a tower, or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing.
in our central american markets and ecuador, significantly all of our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures arising from our new build activities are denominated in u.s. dollars. specifically, most of our ground leases and other property interests, tenant leases, and tower-related expenses are paid in u.s. dollars. in our central american markets, our local currency obligations are principally limited to (1) permitting and other local fees, (2) utilities, and (3) taxes. in brazil, canada, chile, south africa, and the philippines, significantly all of our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures, including tenant leases, ground leases and other property interests, and other tower-related expenses are denominated in local currency. in colombia, argentina, peru, and tanzania, our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures, including tenant leases, ground leases and other property interests, and other tower-related expenses are denominated in a mix of local currency and u.s. dollars.
as indicated in the table below, our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit. for information regarding our operating segments, see note 15 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
for the year ended segment operating profit as a percentage of       december 31, total operating profit                        2021             2020              2019

we believe that the site leasing business continues to be attractive due to its long-term contracts, built-in rent escalators, high operating margins, and low customer churn (which refers to when a customer does not renew its lease or cancels its lease prior to the end of its term) other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessation of a particular technology. we believe that over the long-term, site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use and data transfer, network expansion and network coverage requirements.
during 2022, we expect organic site leasing revenue in both our domestic and international segments to increase over 2021 levels due in part to wireless carriers deploying unused spectrum. we believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and long-term recurring revenues, predictable operating costs and minimal non-discretionary capital expenditures. due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio, we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal. consequently, we expect to grow our cash flows by (1) adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications and (2) executing monetary amendments as wireless service providers add or upgrade their equipment. furthermore, because our towers are strategically positioned, we have historically experienced low tenant lease terminations as a percentage of revenue other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessations of a specific technology.
during 2020, the consolidation of t-mobile and sprint was completed, and we began to experience non-renewal of certain leases as a result of this merger. we currently expect that this churn will represent an aggregate of between $140.0 million and $190.0 million of cash site leasing revenue over the next six years. the aggregate churn estimate includes both overlapping and adjacent sprint leases.
site development our site development business, which is conducted in the united states only, is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities, such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations. site development revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers. our services include: (1) network pre-design; (2) site audits; (3) identification of potential locations for towers and antennas on existing infrastructure; (4) support in leasing of the location; (5) assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits; (6) tower and related site construction; (7) antenna installation; and (8) radio equipment installation, commissioning, and maintenance. we provide site development services at our towers and at towers owned by others on a local basis, through regional, market, and project offices. the market offices are responsible for all site development operations.
for information regarding our operating segments, see note 15 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
capital allocation strategy our capital allocation strategy is aimed at increasing shareholder value through investment in quality assets that meet our return criteria, stock repurchases when we believe our stock price is below its intrinsic value, and by returning cash generated by our operations in the form of cash dividends. while the addition of a cash dividend to our capital allocation strategy in 2019 has provided us with a new tool to return value to our shareholders, we will also continue to make investments focused on increasing adjusted funds from operations per share. to achieve this, we expect to continue to deploy capital to portfolio growth and stock repurchases, subject to compliance with reit distribution requirements, available funds and market conditions, while maintaining our target leverage levels. key elements of our capital allocation strategy include:
portfolio growth. we intend to continue to grow our asset portfolio, domestically and internationally, primarily through tower acquisitions and the construction of new towers that meet our internal return on invested capital criteria.
stock repurchase program. we currently utilize stock repurchases as part of our capital allocation policy when we believe our share price is below its intrinsic value. we believe that share repurchases, when purchased at the right price, will facilitate our goal of increasing our adjusted funds from operations per share.
dividend. cash dividends are an additional component of our strategy of returning value to shareholders. we do not expect our dividend to require any changes in our leverage and believe that, due to our low dividend payout ratio, we can continue to focus on building and buying quality assets and opportunistically buying back our stock. while the timing and amount of future dividends will be subject to approval by our board of directors, we believe that our future cash flow generation will permit us to grow our cash dividend in the future.
covid-19 update we have experienced minimal impact to our business or results of operations from the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic. the extent to which covid-19 could adversely affect our future business operations will depend on future developments such as the duration of the outbreak, new information on the severity of covid-19 or its variants, and methods taken to contain or treat the outbreak of covid-19 including a vaccine distribution program. while the full impact of covid-19 is not yet known, we will continue to monitor these developments and the potential effects on our business.
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list. in many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, with no need for management's judgment in their application. in other cases, management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions. the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2021, included herein. our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant.
revenue recognition and accounts receivable site leasing revenues revenue from site leasing is recognized on a straight-line basis over the current term of the related lease agreements, which are generally five years to 10 years. receivables recorded related to the straight-lining of site leases are reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. rental amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. revenue from site leasing represents 91% of our total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2021.
site development revenues site development projects in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a fixed price basis that are billed at contractual rates. revenue is recognized over time based on milestones achieved, which are determined based on costs incurred. amounts billed in advance (collected or uncollected) are recorded as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets.
revenue from construction projects is recognized over time, determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management's estimated total cost for each contract. this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts. these amounts are based on estimates, and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion. refer to note 5 in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further detail of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable.
the site development segment represents approximately 9% of our total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2021. we account for site development revenue in accordance with asc 606, revenue from contracts with customers. payment terms do not result in any significant financing arrangements. furthermore, these contracts do not typically include variable consideration; therefore, the transaction price that is recognized over time is generally the amount of the total contract.
accounts receivable the accounts receivable balance for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020 was $102.0 million and $74.1 million, respectively, of which $24.6 and $14.3 million related to the site development segment, respectively. we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers. in addition, we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience, specific customer collection issues identified, and past due balances as determined based on contractual terms. interest is charged on outstanding receivables from customers on a case by case basis in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts or agreements with those customers. amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which uncollectibility is determined to be probable. refer to note 15 in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further detail of the site development segment.
lease accounting we adopted asu no. 2016-02, leases ("topic 842") using the modified retrospective adoption method with an effective date of january 1, 2019. this standard requires all lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments. the adoption of the new lease standard had a significant impact on our consolidated balance sheets but did not have a significant impact on our lease classification or a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations and liquidity. additionally, the adoption of topic 842 did not have a material impact on our debt covenant compliance under our current agreements. we have elected to not separate nonlease components from the associated lease component for all underlying classes of assets.
in order to calculate our lease liability, we make certain assumptions related to lease term and discount rate. in making the determination of the period for which we are reasonably certain to remain on the site, we will assume optional renewals are reasonably certain of being exercised for the greater of: (1) a period sufficient to cover all tenants under their current committed term where we have provided rights to the tower not to exceed the contractual ground lease terms including renewals and (2) a period sufficient to recover the investment of significant leasehold improvements located on the site. for the discount rate, we use the rate implicit in the lease when available to discount lease payments to present value. however, our ground leases and other property interests generally do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. therefore, we estimate the incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments based on the lease term and lease currency. we use publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating our incremental borrowing rates. refer to note 2 in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further discussion on lease accounting.
reference rate reform asu 2020-04 and asu 2021-01, reference rate reform, provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. the amendments apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference libor or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. the expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after december 31, 2022, except for hedging relationships existing as of december 31, 2022, that an entity has elected certain optional expedients for and that are retained through the end of the hedging relationship. an entity may elect to apply the amendments prospectively through december 31, 2022. the ice benchmark administration limited ("iba") ceased the publication of usd libor for the 1 week and 2 month tenors on december 31, 2021 and will cease all other tenors on june 30, 2023. on july 7, 2021, we amended our credit facility to provide mechanics relating to a transition away from libor as a benchmark interest rate and the replacement of libor by an alternative benchmark rate. refer to "debt instruments and debt service requirements" below for further discussion of the credit facility. as of december 31, 2021, we have not modified any other contracts as a result of reference rate reform and are evaluating the impact this standard may have on our consolidated financial statements.
results of operations this report presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis, which are non-gaap measures, gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. we eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period's financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period, as well as by eliminating the impact of realized and unrealized gains and losses on our intercompany loans.

interest expense decreased $15.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year. this change was primarily due to a lower weighted average interest rate due in part to the interest rate swap entered into during third quarter of 2020, partially offset by a higher average principal amount of cash interest bearing debt outstanding.
non-cash interest expense increased $22.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year primarily related to amortization of accumulated losses related to our interest rate swaps de-designated as cash flow hedges.
loss from extinguishment of debt was $39.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2021 representing the payment of a $13.4 million call premium and the write-off of $10.3 million of the unamortized financing fees related to the redemption of the 2016 senior notes in november 2021, the payment of a $7.5 million call premium and the write-off of $4.2 million of the unamortized financing fees related to the redemption of the 2017 senior notes in february 2021, the write-off of $2.0 million of unamortized financing fees related to the repayment of the 2017-1c tower securities in may 2021, and the write-off of $2.0 million of unamortized financing fees related to the repayment of the 2013-2c tower securities in october 2021. loss from extinguishment of debt was $19.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2020 representing the payment of a $9.1 million call premium and the write-off of $7.7 million of the original issuance discount and unamortized financing fees related to the redemption of the 2014 senior notes in february 2020, as well as the write-off of $2.6 million of unamortized financing fees related to the repayment of the 2015-1c tower securities and 2016-1c tower securities in july 2020.
other expense, net includes a $66.3 million loss on the remeasurement of u.s. dollar denominated intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries for the year ended december 31, 2021, while the prior year period included a $220.4 million loss.

net income was $237.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, as compared to net income of $24.0 million in the prior year period. this change was primarily due to an increase in operating income, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates including changes recorded on the remeasurement of the u.s. dollar denominated intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries, and a decrease in cash interest expense related to the interest rate swaps. this was partially offset by increases in non-cash interest expense, loss from the extinguishment of debt, and provision for income taxes.
year ended 2020 compared to year ended 2019
for a discussion of our 2020 results of operations, including a discussion of our financial results for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended december 31, 2019, refer to part i, item 7 of our annual report on form 10-k filed with the sec on february 25, 2021.
non-gaap financial measures this report contains information regarding adjusted ebitda, a non-gaap measure. we have provided below a description of adjusted ebitda, a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to its most directly comparable gaap measure and an explanation as to why management utilizes this measure. this report also presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis, which are non-gaap measures, gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. we eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period's financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period, as well as by eliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans.
adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as net income excluding the impact of non-cash straight-line leasing revenue, non-cash straight-line ground lease expense, non-cash compensation, net loss from extinguishment of debt, other income and expenses, acquisition and new business initiatives related adjustments and expenses, asset impairment and decommission costs, interest income, interest expenses, depreciation, accretion, and amortization, and income taxes.
we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. adjusted ebitda is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. management believes that adjusted ebitda helps investors or other interested parties to meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. management also believes adjusted ebitda is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of reits. in addition, adjusted ebitda is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our senior credit agreement and the indentures relating to the 2020 senior notes and 2021 senior notes. adjusted ebitda should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance.

(1)during the year ended december 31, 2021, we acquired the exclusive right to lease and operate 713 utility transmission structures, which included existing wireless tenant licenses from pg&e. the difference between the agreed upon purchase price of $972.0 million and the cash acquisition amount is due to working capital adjustments.
(2)excludes $16.3 million and $12.3 million spent to extend ground lease terms for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. in addition, the year ended december 31, 2020 includes amounts paid related to the acquisition of data centers.
on january 4, 2022, we closed on 1,445 sites under the previously announced deal with airtel tanzania for $176.1 million. legal title was fully transferred at closing for 963 of the towers. the remaining 482 towers are pending post-closing site level documentation and due diligence and will be initially accounted for as acquired right-of-use assets until the full transfer of title for these towers is completed, which we anticipate to be in tranches through the end of the second quarter of 2023. during this period of time, we have all the economic rights and obligations related to these towers. additionally, subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2021, we purchased or are under contract to purchase 371 communication sites for an aggregate amount of $137.1 million. we anticipate that these acquisitions will be consummated by the end of the third quarter of 2022.
for 2022, we expect to incur non-discretionary cash capital expenditures associated with tower maintenance and general corporate expenditures of $45.0 million to $55.0 million and discretionary cash capital expenditures, based on current or potential acquisition obligations, planned new tower construction, forecasted tower augmentations, and forecasted ground lease purchases, of $525.0 million to $545.0 million. we expect to fund these cash capital expenditures from cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and borrowings under the revolving credit facility or new financings. the exact amount of our future cash capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors, including amounts necessary to support our tower portfolio, our new tower build and acquisition programs, and our ground lease purchase program.

debt instruments and debt service requirements terms of the senior credit agreement on july 7, 2021, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, sba senior finance ii llc, amended our revolving credit facility to (1) increase the total commitments under the facility from $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion, (2) extend the maturity date of the facility to july 7, 2026, (3) lower the applicable interest rate margins and commitment fees under the facility, (4) provide mechanics relating to a transition away from libor as a benchmark interest rate and the replacement of libor by an alternative benchmark rate, (5) incorporate sustainability-linked targets which will adjust the facility's applicable interest and commitment fee rates upward or downward based on how we perform against those targets, and (6) amend certain other terms and conditions under the senior credit agreement.
the senior credit agreement, as amended, requires sba senior finance ii to maintain specific financial ratios, including (1) a ratio of consolidated net debt to annualized borrower ebitda not to exceed 6.5 times for any fiscal quarter, (2) a ratio of consolidated net debt (calculated in accordance with the senior credit agreement) to annualized borrower ebitda for the most recently ended fiscal quarter not to exceed 6.5 times for 30 consecutive days and (3) a ratio of annualized borrower ebitda to annualized cash interest expense (calculated in accordance with the senior credit agreement) of not less than 2.0 times for any fiscal quarter. the senior credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of sba senior finance ii and its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, grant certain liens, make certain investments, enter into sale leaseback transactions, merge or consolidate, make certain restricted payments, enter into transactions with affiliates, and engage in certain asset dispositions, including a sale of all or substantially all of their property. the senior credit agreement is also subject to customary events of default. pursuant to the second amended and restated guarantee and collateral agreement, amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility, the term loans and certain hedging transactions that may be entered into by sba senior finance ii or the subsidiary guarantors (as defined in the senior credit agreement) with lenders or their affiliates are secured by a first lien on the membership interests of sba telecommunications, llc, sba senior finance, llc and sba senior finance ii and on substantially all of the assets (other than leasehold, easement and fee interests in real property) of sba senior finance ii and the subsidiary guarantors.
the senior credit agreement, as amended, permits sba senior finance ii, without the consent of the other lenders, to request that one or more lenders provide sba senior finance ii with increases in the revolving credit facility or additional term loans provided that after giving effect to the proposed increase in revolving credit facility commitments or incremental term loans the ratio of consolidated net debt to annualized borrower ebitda would not exceed 6.5 times. sba senior finance ii's ability to request such increases in the revolving credit facility or additional term loans is subject to its compliance with customary conditions set forth in the senior credit agreement including compliance, on a pro forma basis, with the financial covenants and ratios set forth therein and, with respect to any additional term loan, an increase in the margin on existing term loans to the extent required by the terms of the senior credit agreement. upon sba senior finance ii's request, each lender may decide, in its sole discretion, whether to increase all or a portion of its revolving credit facility commitment or whether to provide sba senior finance ii with additional term loans and, if so, upon what terms.
revolving credit facility under the senior credit agreement the revolving credit facility consists of a revolving loan under which up to $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount may be borrowed, repaid and redrawn, based upon specific financial ratios and subject to the satisfaction of other customary conditions to borrowing. amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility accrue interest, at sba senior finance ii's election, at either (1) the eurodollar rate plus a margin that ranges from 112.5 basis points to 150.0 basis points or (2) the base rate plus a margin that ranges from 12.5 basis points to 50.0 basis points, in each case based on the ratio of consolidated net debt to annualized borrower ebitda, calculated in accordance with the senior credit agreement. in addition, sba senior finance ii is required to pay a commitment fee of between 0.15% and 0.25% per annum on the amount of unused commitment. borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes. sba senior finance ii may, from time to time, borrow from and repay the revolving credit facility. consequently, the amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility at the end of the period may not be reflective of the total amounts outstanding during such period.

the borrowers may prepay any of the mortgage loan components, in whole or in part, with no prepayment consideration, (1) within twelve months (in the case of the component corresponding to the 2018-1c tower securities, 2019-1c tower securities, 2020-1c tower securities, 2021-1c tower securities, and 2021-2c tower securities) or eighteen months (in the case of the components corresponding to the 2014-2c tower securities, 2020-2c tower securities, and 2021-3c tower securities) of the anticipated repayment date of such mortgage loan component, (2) with proceeds received as a result of any condemnation or casualty of any tower owned by the borrowers or (3) during an amortization period. in all other circumstances, the borrowers may prepay the mortgage loan, in whole or in part, upon payment of the applicable prepayment consideration. the prepayment consideration is determined based on the class of the tower securities to which the prepaid mortgage loan component corresponds and consists of an amount equal to the net present value associated with the portion of the principal balance being prepaid and calculated in accordance with the formula set forth in the mortgage loan agreement.
to the extent that the mortgage loan components corresponding to the tower securities are not fully repaid by their respective anticipated repayment dates, the interest rate of each such component will increase by the greater of (1) 5% and (2) the amount, if any, by which the sum of (x) the 10 year u.s. treasury rate plus (y) the credit-based spread for such component (as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement) plus (z) 5%, exceeds the original interest rate for such component.
pursuant to the terms of the tower securities, all rents and other sums due on any of the towers owned by the borrowers are directly deposited by the lessees into a controlled deposit account and are held by the indenture trustee. the monies held by the indenture trustee after the release date are classified as short-term restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets (see note 4). however, if the debt service coverage ratio, defined as the net cash flow (as defined in the mortgage loan agreement) divided by the amount of interest on the mortgage loan, servicing fees and trustee fees that the borrowers are required to pay over the succeeding twelve months, as of the end of any calendar quarter, falls to 1.30x or lower, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents, referred to as "excess cash flow," will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the borrowers. the funds in the reserve account will not be released to the borrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.30x for two consecutive calendar quarters. if the debt service coverage ratio falls below 1.15x as of the end of any calendar quarter, then an "amortization period" will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.15x for a calendar quarter. in addition, if any of the tower securities are not fully repaid by their respective anticipated repayment dates, the cash flow from the towers owned by the borrowers will be trapped by the trustee for the tower securities and applied first to repay the interest, at the original interest rates, on the mortgage loan components underlying the tower securities, second to fund all reserve accounts and operating expenses associated with those towers, third to pay the management fees due to network management, fourth to repay principal of the tower securities and fifth to repay the additional interest discussed above. furthermore, the advance rents reserve requirement states that the borrowers are required to maintain an advance rents reserve at any time the monthly tenant debt service coverage ratio is equal to or less than 2:1 and for two calendar months after such coverage ratio again exceeds 2:1. the mortgage loan agreement, as amended, also includes covenants customary for mortgage loans subject to rated securitizations. among other things, the borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets.

inflation the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date. however, we cannot assure you that a high rate of inflation in the future will not adversely affect our operating results particularly in light of the fact that our site leasing revenues are governed by long-term contracts with pre-determined pricing that we will not be able to increase in response to increases in inflation other than our contracts in south america, south africa, the philippines, and tanzania which have inflationary index based rent escalators.

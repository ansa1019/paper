item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
overview our fiscal year typically includes 52 weeks, comprised of three twelve-week quarters and one sixteen-week quarter. every five or six years our fiscal year includes an extra (or 53rd) week in the fourth quarter. fiscal 2021 and 2019 each consisted of 52 weeks and fiscal 2020 consisted of 53 weeks.
in this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the year ended january 2, 2022 compared to the year ended january 3, 2021. for a discussion of the year ended january 3, 2021 compared to the year ended december 29, 2019, please refer to part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended january 3, 2021.
description of the business domino's is the largest pizza company in the world, with more than 18,800 locations in over 90 markets around the world as of january 2, 2022, and operates two distinct service models within its stores with a significant business in both delivery and carryout. founded in 1960, our roots are in convenient pizza delivery, while a significant amount of our sales also come from carryout customers. although we are a highly-recognized global brand, we focus on value while serving neighborhoods locally through our large network of franchise owners and company-owned stores.
our business model is straightforward: domino's stores handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price, with easy ordering access and efficient service, enhanced by our technological innovations. our hand-tossed dough is made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees.
domino's generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our independent franchisees. we also generate revenues and earnings by selling food, equipment and supplies to franchisees, primarily in the u.s. and canada, and by operating a number of company-owned stores in the u.s. franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers. in our international markets, we generally grant geographical rights to the domino's pizza brand to master franchisees. these master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area, and they can profit by sub-franchising and selling food and equipment to those sub-franchisees, as well as by running pizza stores directly. we believe that everyone in the system can benefit, including the end consumer, who can feed their family conveniently and economically.
our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our franchise and company-owned stores. changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts. we monitor both of these metrics very closely, as they directly impact our revenues and profits, and we strive to consistently increase both metrics. retail sales drive royalty payments from franchisees, as well as company-owned store and supply chain revenues. retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the domino's pizza brand, the results of our extensive advertising through various media channels, the impact of technological innovation and digital ordering, our ability to execute our strong and proven business model and the overall global economic environment.
our business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and our company-owned stores. it can also yield significant cash flow to us, through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream, with moderate capital expenditures. we have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases since becoming a publicly-traded company in 2004. we believe we have a proven business model for success, which includes leading with technology, service and product innovation and leveraging our global scale, which has historically provided strong returns for our shareholders critical accounting estimates the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, our management evaluates its estimates, including those related to long-lived assets, casualty insurance reserves and income taxes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from those estimates, and changes in estimates could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period.
we believe that our most critical accounting estimates are:
long-lived assets we record long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and capitalized software, at cost. for acquisitions of franchise operations, we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets, historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition. we depreciate and amortize long-lived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us. our estimates of the useful lives of our long-lived assets have not changed during the periods presented. we evaluate the potential impairment of long-lived assets at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. our periodic evaluation is based on various analyses, including, on an annual basis, the projection of undiscounted cash flows. if we determine that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable, we compare the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group. for company-owned stores, we perform related impairment tests on an operating market basis, which we have determined to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other cash flows. if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds the amount of the expected future undiscounted cash flows of that asset, we estimate the fair value of the asset. if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to project the future market cash flows of company-owned stores during the years presented. same store sales fluctuations and the rates at which operating costs will fluctuate in the future are key factors in determining projected cash flows used to evaluate recoverability of the related assets. if our same store sales significantly decline or if operating costs increase and we are unable to recover these costs, the carrying value of our company-owned stores, by market, may be unrecoverable and we may be required to recognize an impairment charge. there were no triggering events in 2021, 2020 or 2019, and accordingly, we did not record any impairment losses on long-lived assets in 2021, 2020 and 2019.
casualty insurance reserves for certain periods prior to december 1998 and for periods after december 2001, we maintain insurance coverage for workers' compensation, general liability and owned and non-owned auto liabilities. we are generally responsible for up to $2.0 million per occurrence under these retention programs for workers' compensation and general liability, depending on policy year and line of coverage. we are generally responsible for up to between $500,000 and $5.5 million per occurrence under these retention programs for owned and non-owned automobile liabilities, depending on policy year and line of coverage. the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates, which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events. there is inherent uncertainty in the ultimate cost for known claims under our insurance coverages, and for incidents that have occurred that will be subject to a claim, but have yet to be reported to us. analyses of historical trends and actuarial valuation methods are utilized to estimate the ultimate claim costs for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date and for claims incurred but not yet reported. when estimating these liabilities, several factors are considered, including the severity, duration and frequency of claims, legal cost associated with claims, healthcare trends and projected inflation.
our methodology for determining our exposure has remained consistent throughout the years presented. management believes that the various assumptions developed, and actuarial methods used to determine our casualty insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks. changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions, as well as changes in actual experience, could cause our estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods. a 10% change in our casualty insurance liability at january 2, 2022 would have affected our income before provision for income taxes by approximately $5.6 million in 2021. we had accruals for casualty insurance reserves of $56.5 million and $54.6 million at january 2, 2022 and january 3, 2021, respectively.
income taxes the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate was 21% in each of 2021, 2020 and 2019. our federal income tax provision calculated based on the federal statutory rate was $131.4 million, $116.6 million and $101.4 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. we measure deferred taxes using current enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid. judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, related reserves and deferred taxes. these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets, if necessary. on an ongoing basis, management will assess whether it remains more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. our accounting for deferred taxes represents our best estimate of future events. except with respect to certain foreign tax credits and interest deductibility in separately filed states, our deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions, based on our estimates and assumptions. as of january 2, 2022 and january 3, 2021, we had total foreign tax credits of $10.2 million and $6.6 million, respectively, each of which were fully offset with a corresponding valuation allowance. we also had valuation allowances related to interest deductibility in separately filed states of $1.2 million and $1.0 million as of january 2, 2022 and january 3, 2021, respectively. we believe our remaining deferred tax assets will be realized. changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
fiscal 2021 highlights
•global retail sales, excluding foreign currency impact (which includes total retail sales at company-owned and franchised stores worldwide) increased 8.9% as compared to 2020. u.s. retail sales increased 4.3% and international retail sales, excluding foreign currency impact, increased 13.9% as compared to 2020.
•same store sales increased 3.5% in our u.s. stores and increased 8.0% in our international stores.
•our revenues increased 5.8%.
•our income from operations increased 7.5%.
•our net income increased 3.9%.
•our diluted earnings per share increased 9.3%.
•the inclusion of the 53rd week in 2020 negatively impacted our results as compared to the prior year.
during 2021, we experienced global retail sales growth and u.s. and international same store sales growth. we believe our commitment to value, convenience, quality and new products continues to keep consumers engaged with the brand. we launched our newest side item in the u.s., domino's oven-baked dips in three unique flavors including cheesy marinara, five cheese and baked apple to pair with our domino's bread twists.
same store sales in the u.s. continue to be positively affected by changes in consumer ordering behavior observed since the onset of the covid-19 pandemic, but have been pressured in part in recent quarters due to labor shortages affecting store hours and staffing levels in many of our markets, as well as a waning in the level of economic stimulus activity in fiscal 2021 in the u.s. as compared to the prior year. our strong international same store sales performance continued with 112 straight quarters of positive international same store sales. we also continued to experience sustained increases in retail sales during fiscal 2021 resulting from evolving consumer trends, as well as the reopening and resumption of normal store hours and operating procedures at certain of our international franchised stores that had been temporarily closed or affected by changes in operating procedures and store hours for portions of fiscal 2020 as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. our u.s. and international same store sales results continue to be impacted by our fortressing strategy, which includes increasing store concentration in certain markets where we compete, as well as from aggressive competitive activity.
during 2021, we continued our global expansion with the opening of 1,204 net stores. we had 205 net stores open in the u.s. comprised of 214 store openings and 9 closures. we had 999 net stores open internationally comprised of 1,094 store openings and 95 closures.
we remained focused on improving the customer experience through our technology initiatives, including through our gps delivery tracking technology, which allows customers to monitor the progress of their food, from the preparation stages to the time it is in the oven to the time it arrives at their doors. additionally, we offer contactless carryout nationwide - via domino's carside delivery®, which customers can choose when placing a prepaid online order. our emphasis on technological innovation helped the domino's system generate more than half of global retail sales from digital channels in 2021. overall, we believe our global store growth, strong sales, emphasis on technology, operations and marketing initiatives have combined to strengthen our brand.
statistical measures the tables below outline certain statistical measures we utilize to analyze our performance. this historical data is not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period.
global retail sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact)
global retail sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact) is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. global retail sales growth refers to total worldwide retail sales at company-owned and franchise stores. we believe global retail sales information is useful in analyzing revenues because franchisees pay royalties and, in the u.s., advertising fees that are based on a percentage of franchise retail sales. we review comparable industry global retail sales information to assess business trends and to track the growth of the domino's pizza brand. in addition, supply chain revenues are directly impacted by changes in franchise retail sales in the u.s. and canada. retail sales for franchise stores are reported to us by our franchisees and are not included in our revenues. global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, is calculated as the change of international local currency global retail sales against the comparable period of the prior year. global retail sales growth in 2021 and 2020 reflect the impact of the 53rd week in 2020.

revenues primarily consist of retail sales from our company-owned stores, royalties and fees and advertising contributions from our u.s. franchised stores, royalties and fees from our international franchised stores and sales of food, equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to substantially all of our u.s. franchised stores and certain international franchised stores. company-owned store and franchised store revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix. supply chain revenues may vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell.
consolidated revenues increased $240.0 million, or 5.8%, in 2021 due primarily to higher global retail sales, which resulted in higher supply chain revenues, international franchise royalties and fees, u.s. franchise royalties and fees, and u.s. franchise advertising revenues. these increases were partially offset by the inclusion of the 53rd week in 2020 which positively impacted revenues in 2020 by an estimated $88.4 million. these changes in revenues are described in more detail below.

u.s. company-owned stores revenues from u.s. company-owned store operations decreased $6.6 million, or 1.4%, in 2021 due primarily to an estimated $10.6 million impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2020, as well as a decrease in u.s. company-owned same store sales. u.s. company-owned same store sales declined 3.6% in 2021 and increased 11.0% in 2020. these decreases in 2021 were partially offset by an increase in the average number of u.s. company-owned stores open during the period resulting from net store growth.
u.s. franchise royalties and fees revenues from u.s. franchise royalties and fees increased $36.7 million, or 7.3%, in 2021, due primarily to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of u.s. franchised stores open during the period resulting from net store growth. revenues were also benefited by approximately $3.0 million related to funding we provided to our franchisees for an effort to donate 10 million slices of pizza to people and organizations at the frontlines of the covid-19 pandemic in the franchisees' local communities during 2020 which did not recur in 2021. u.s. franchise same store sales increased 3.9% in 2021 and increased 11.5% in 2020. u.s. franchise royalties and fees further benefited from an increase in revenues from fees paid by franchisees for the use of our technology platforms. these increases were partially offset by an estimated $11.4 million impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2020.
u.s. franchise advertising revenues from u.s. franchise advertising increased $17.3 million, or 3.7%, in 2021 due primarily to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of u.s. franchised stores open during the year resulting from net store growth. these increases were partially offset by an estimated $10.4 million impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2020 as well as approximately $9.3 million in advertising incentives related to the domino's surprise freestm promotion in 2021.
supply chain supply chain revenues increased $144.3 million or 6.0% in 2021 due primarily to higher volumes resulting from retail sales growth. our market basket pricing to stores increased 3.3% during 2021, which resulted in an estimated $66.3 million increase in supply chain revenues. these increases were partially offset by an estimated $49.6 million impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2020.
international franchise royalties and fees revenues from international franchise operations increased $48.3 million, or 19.3%, in 2021 due primarily to higher retail sales resulting from same store sales growth and an increase in the average number of international franchised stores open during the period resulting from net store growth. the reopening and resumption of normal store hours and operating procedures at certain of the company's international franchised stores that had been temporarily closed or affected by changes in operating procedures and store hours for portions of 2020 as a result of the covid-19 pandemic also contributed to the increase in revenues. excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, international same store sales increased 8.0% in 2021 and increased 4.4% in 2020. changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted revenue from international royalties and fees by approximately $4.9 million in 2021. these increases were partially offset by an estimated $6.4 million impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2020.

consolidated operating margin            $1,688.2            38.7   %            $1,594.5            38.7   %
consolidated cost of sales consists primarily of u.s. company-owned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues. components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food, labor, delivery and occupancy costs. we estimate that the 53rd week resulted in an increase of approximately $50.6 million to consolidated cost of sales in fiscal 2020.
consolidated operating margin (which we define as revenues less cost of sales) increased $93.7 million, or 5.9%, in 2021 due primarily to higher global franchise revenues and higher supply chain volumes. franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on the operating margin. these increases were partially offset by an estimated $37.8 million impact on consolidated operating margin related to the 53rd week in fiscal 2020.
as a percentage of revenues, the consolidated operating margin was flat at 38.7% in 2021 and 2020. company-owned store operating margin increased 0.1 percentage points in 2021 and supply chain operating margin decreased 0.9 percentage points in 2021. these changes in operating margin are described in more detail below.

u.s. company-owned store operating margin (which does not include other store-level costs such as royalties and advertising) decreased $1.1 million, or 1.0%, in 2021 due primarily to lower same store sales, as well an estimated $3.2 million impact of the 53rd week in 2020. higher food and occupancy costs also contributed to the decrease in u.s. company-owned store operating margin. these decreases were partially offset by lower labor costs. as a percentage of store revenues, the store operating margin increased 0.1 percentage points in 2021. these changes in operating margin as a percentage of revenues are discussed in more detail below.
•labor costs decreased 1.9 percentage points to 29.0% in 2021 due primarily to additional bonus pay incurred during 2020 for frontline team members, as well as lower team member headcount in 2021. these decreases in labor costs were partially offset by continued investments in frontline team member wage rates in our u.s. company-owned stores in 2021.
•food costs increased 1.1 percentage points to 28.1% in 2021, due to higher food basket prices.
•occupancy costs, which include rent, telephone, utilities and depreciation, increased 0.6 percentage points to 8.0% in 2021 due primarily to lower sales leverage.

supply chain operating margin decreased $7.4 million, or 2.7%, in 2021 due primarily to an estimated $6.4 million impact of the 53rd week in 2020, as well as higher labor and delivery costs. these decreases were partially offset by higher volumes. as a percentage of supply chain revenues, the supply chain operating margin decreased 0.9 percentage points in 2021, due primarily to higher labor and delivery costs.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased $21.7 million, or 5.3%, in 2021 driven primarily by higher labor costs, including non-cash equity-based compensation expense. higher travel and event costs also contributed to the increase in general and administrative expenses. these increases were partially offset by lower professional fees and an estimated $5.6 million impact of the 53rd week in 2020.
u.s. franchise advertising expenses u.s. franchise advertising expenses increased $17.3 million, or 3.7%, in 2021 due to higher u.s. franchise advertising revenues as discussed above. this increase was partially offset by an estimated $10.4 million impact of the 53rd week in 2020. u.s. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related u.s. franchise advertising revenues are recognized, as our consolidated not-for-profit advertising fund is obligated to expend such revenues on advertising and other activities to promote the domino's brand and these revenues cannot be used for general corporate purposes.
other income other income was $36.8 million in 2021, representing the unrealized gains recorded on the company's investment in dpc dash resulting from the observable changes in price from the valuation of the company's additional $40.0 million investment made in the first quarter of 2021 and the additional $9.1 million investment made in the fourth quarter of 2021.
interest expense, net interest expense, net, increased $20.9 million, or 12.3%, in 2021 driven primarily by higher average borrowings resulting from the 2021 recapitalization. in connection with the 2021 recapitalization, we recorded $2.3 million of incremental interest expense in the second quarter of 2021, primarily representing the expense for $2.0 million of the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the 2017 five-year fixed rate notes and 2017 floating rate notes (each defined in the "2017 recapitalization" section, below), and $0.3 million of additional interest expense incurred on the 2017 five-year fixed rate notes and 2017 floating rate notes subsequent to the closing of the 2021 recapitalization but prior to the repayment of the 2017 five-year fixed rate notes and 2017 floating rate notes, resulting in the payment of interest on both the 2017 five-year fixed rate notes and 2017 floating rate notes and the 2021 notes (as defined in the "2021 recapitalization" section, below) for a short period of time. this increase was partially offset by an estimated $2.6 million impact of the 53rd week in 2020.
our weighted average borrowing rate decreased to 3.8% in 2021, from 3.9% in 2020, resulting from the lower interest rates on the debt outstanding in 2021 as compared to the same periods in 2020.
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased $51.4 million, or 80.5%, in 2021 and the effective tax rate increased to 18.4% in 2021 as compared to 11.5% in 2020 due primarily to lower excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation, which are recorded as a reduction to the income tax provision. excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation were $18.9 million in 2021 and were $60.4 million in 2020. the decrease in excess tax benefits resulted from a significant decrease in stock options exercised in 2021 as compared to 2020. higher pre-tax income also resulted in an increase in the provision for income taxes. these increases were partially offset by an estimated $4.0 million related to the 53rd week of 2020.
segment income we evaluate the performance of our reportable segments and allocate resources to them based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other, referred to as segment income. segment income for each of our reportable segments is summarized in the table below. other segment income primarily includes corporate administrative costs that are not allocable to a reportable segment, including labor, computer expenses, professional fees, travel and entertainment, rent, insurance and other corporate administrative costs.
2021                           2020

u.s. stores u.s. stores segment income increased $19.8 million, or 4.5%, in 2021, primarily as a result of the increase in revenues from u.s. franchise royalties and fees of $36.7 million discussed above. u.s. franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on u.s. stores segment income. u.s. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related u.s. franchise advertising revenues are recognized and had no impact on u.s. stores segment income. the increase in u.s. stores segment income was partially offset by increased investments in technological initiatives as well as the $1.1 million decrease in u.s. company-owned store operating margin discussed above.
supply chain supply chain segment income decreased $8.5 million, or 3.6%, in 2021 due primarily to the $7.4 million decrease in supply chain operating margin described above.
international franchise international franchise segment income increased $44.3 million, or 22.4%, in 2021 due primarily to the $48.3 million increase in international franchise revenues discussed above. international franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on international franchise segment income. the increase in international franchise segment income driven by higher revenues was partially offset by increased investments in technological initiatives.
other other segment income increased $10.3 million, or 19.4%, in 2021 due primarily to higher corporate administrative costs allocated to our segments as compared to 2020. the increase in allocated costs in 2021 was due primarily to higher investments in technological initiatives to support technology for our u.s. and international franchise stores. lower professional fees also contributed to the increase in other segment income. these increases were partially offset by higher labor and travel costs.
new accounting pronouncements the impact of new accounting pronouncements adopted and the estimated impact of new accounting pronouncements that we will adopt in future years is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
covid-19 impact as of january 2, 2022, nearly all of our u.s. stores were open, with stores deploying contactless delivery and carryout solutions. based on information reported to us by our master franchisees, we estimate that as of january 2, 2022, there were fewer than 50 international stores temporarily closed.
during the covid-19 pandemic, we made certain investments related to safety and cleaning equipment, enhanced sick pay and compensation for frontline team members and support for our franchisees and their communities. while we have seen an increase in sales in certain markets during the covid-19 pandemic, including increased sales related to heightened reliance on delivery and carryout businesses, future sales are not possible to estimate and it is unclear whether and to what extent sales will return to more normalized levels if and when consumer behavior and general economic and business activity return to pre-pandemic levels. while it is not possible at this time to estimate the full continued impact that covid-19 could have on our business, the continued spread of covid-19 and the measures taken by the governments of countries affected could disrupt our continuing operations and supply chain and, as a result, could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.
liquidity and capital resources historically, our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities resulting in efficient deployment of working capital. we generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience multiple inventory turns per month. in addition, our sales are not typically seasonal, which further limits variations in our working capital requirements. these factors allow us to manage our working capital and our ongoing cash flows from operations to invest in our business and other strategic opportunities, pay dividends and repurchase and retire shares of our common stock. as of january 2, 2022, we had working capital of $82.1 million, excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of $180.6 million, advertising fund assets, restricted, of $180.9 million and advertising fund liabilities of $173.7 million. working capital includes total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $148.2 million.
our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our variable funding notes. during 2021, we experienced increases in both u.s. and international same store sales versus the comparable periods in the prior year. additionally, our u.s. and international businesses grew store counts in 2021. these factors contributed to our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows. the company has a variable funding note facility which allows for advances of up to $200.0 million of 2021 variable funding notes (defined in the "2021 recapitalization" section, below). the letters of credit are primarily related to our casualty insurance programs and certain supply chain center leases. as of january 2, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings and $155.8 million of available borrowing capacity under our 2021 variable funding notes, net of letters of credit issued of $44.2 million.
we expect to continue to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, excess cash from our recapitalization transactions and available borrowings under our 2021 variable funding notes to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, invest in our core business and other strategic opportunities, pay dividends and repurchase and retire shares of our common stock.
our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to service our debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described in item 1a. risk factors. there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the 2021 variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance the 2021, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2015 notes and to service, extend or refinance the 2021 variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
restricted cash as of january 2, 2022, we had $133.2 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents held for future principal and interest payments and other working capital requirements of our asset-backed securitization structure, $47.2 million of restricted cash equivalents held in a three-month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and $0.2 million of other restricted cash for a total of $180.6 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. as of january 2, 2022, we also held $161.7 million of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents, which can only be used for activities that promote the domino's brand.
long-term debt
2021 recapitalization on april 16, 2021, we completed the 2021 recapitalization in which certain of our subsidiaries issued notes pursuant to an asset-backed securitization. the notes consist of $850.0 million series 2021-1 2.662% fixed rate senior secured notes, class a-2-i with an anticipated term of 7.5 years (the "2021 7.5-year notes") and $1.0 billion series 2021-1 3.151% fixed rate senior secured notes, class a-2-ii with an anticipated term of 10 years (the "2021 ten-year notes", and, collectively with the 2021 7.5-year notes, the "2021 notes"). gross proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 notes were $1.85 billion.

the proceeds from the 2021 recapitalization was used to repay the remaining $291.0 million in outstanding principal under our 2017 floating rate notes and $582.0 million in outstanding principal under our 2017 five-year fixed rate notes, prefund a portion of the interest payable on the 2021 notes, pay transaction fees and expenses and repurchase and retire shares of our common stock. additional information related to the 2021 recapitalization is included in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.
2019 recapitalization on november 19, 2019, we completed the 2019 recapitalization in which certain of our subsidiaries issued $675.0 million series 2019-1 3.668% fixed rate senior secured notes, class a-2 with an anticipated term of 10 years (the "2019 notes") pursuant to an asset-backed securitization. concurrently, we also issued the 2019 variable funding notes. gross proceeds from the issuance of the 2019 notes was $675.0 million. additional information related to the 2019 recapitalization is included in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.

operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased $61.4 million in 2021 primarily due to the positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $63.9 million. the positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities related to the timing of collections on accounts receivable, payments on accounts payable and accrued liabilities and income tax payments in 2021 as compared to 2020. the increase in cash provided by operating activities was also due to a $16.4 million positive impact of changes in advertising fund assets and liabilities, restricted, in 2021 as compared to 2020 due to the receipt of advertising contributions outpacing payments for advertising activities. additionally, while net income increased $19.2 million, this was comprised of a $38.2 million increase in non-cash transactions, resulting in an overall decrease to cash provided by operating activities in 2021 as compared to 2020 of $18.9 million.

impairments
.
we participate in a capital
-intensive industry.
at times, our pp&e and investments become impaired when, for example, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, our reserve estimates are revised downward, a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value, or the current fair value of an investment is less than its carrying amount and the loss in value is deemed other than temporary.
as we optimize our assets in the future, it is reasonably possible we may incur future losses upon sale or impairment charges to long-lived assets used in operations, investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method, and unproved properties.
for more information on our impairments, see note 6
and note 7
.
●
effective tax rate
.
our operations are in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures.
accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the "mix" of before-tax earnings within our global operations.
●
fiscal and regulatory environment
.
our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including civil unrest or strained relationships with governments that may impact our operations or investments.
these changing environments could negatively impact our results of operations, and further changes to increase government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations.
our management carefully considers the fiscal and regulatory environment when evaluating projects or determining the levels and locations of our activity.
outlook production and capital
2022 operating plan capital budget is $7.2 billion.
the plan includes funding for ongoing development drilling programs, major projects, exploration and appraisal activities, base maintenance and
$0.2 billion for projects to reduce the company's scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity and investme nts in several early-stage low-carbon opportunities that address end-use emissions.
production guidance is 1.8 mmboed in 2022 including libya but excluding the impacts from the pending indonesia disposition and acquisition of additional aplng shareholding interest.
first quarter 2022 production is expected to be 1.75 mmboed to 1.79 mmboed.
operating segments we manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region:
alaska; lower 48; canada; europe, middle east and north africa; asia pacific; and other international.
corporate and other represents income and costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt, corporate overhead, certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues.
our key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow, reflect results from our operations, including commodity prices and production.

(2,701)
7,189
net income (loss) attributable to conocophillips increased $10.8 billion in 2021.
2021 earnings were positively impacted by:
●
higher realized commodity prices.
●
higher sales volumes primarily due to our concho acquisition and absence of production curtailments.
see note 3
.
●
a gain of $1,040 million after-tax on our cenovus energy (cve) common shares in 2021, as compared to a
$855 million after-tax loss on those shares in 2020.
●
lower exploration expenses due to:
o absence of a 2020 impairment for $648 million after
-tax for the entire carrying value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs related to our alaska north slope gas asset.
o lower dry hole expenses.
o absence of early cancellation of our 2020 winter exploration program in alaska.
o absence of unproved property impairment and dry hole expenses in 2020 for the kamunsu east field in malaysia, which is no longer in our development plans.
●
higher equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily due to higher lng sales prices.
●
contingent payments related to prior dispositions in our canada and lower 48 segments.
●
an after-tax gain of $194 million recognized for a fid bonus associated with our australia
-west divestiture in 2020.
see note 3
.
●
lower impairments, primarily due to the absence of impairments recognized in 2020 for noncore assets in our lower 48 segment partially offset by an impairment in our aplng investment included within our asia pacific segment.
see note 7
.
these increases in net income (loss) were partly offset by:
●
higher production and operating expenses and taxes other than income taxes, primarily due to higher sales volumes.
●
higher dd&a expenses caused by higher production volumes, partially offset by lower rates driven from positive reserve revisions due to higher commodity prices in 2021.
●
absence of a $597 million after-tax gain on our australia-west divestiture completed in may
2020.
●
restructuring and transaction expenses of $341 million after-tax associated with the concho and shell acquisitions in addition to mark-to-market impacts on certain key employee compensation programs.

see note 12
.
income statement analysis unless otherwise indicated, all results in income statement analysis are before-tax.
sales and other operating revenues increased 144 percent in 2021, mainly due to higher realized commodity prices and higher sales volumes.
equity in earnings of affiliates increased
$400 million in 2021, primarily due to higher earnings driven by higher lng and crude prices, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate related to equity method investments in our europe, middle east and north africa segment
.
gain on dispositions decreased $63 million in 2021, primarily due to the absence of a $587 million gain related to our 2020 australia-west divestiture and a $179 million loss associated with the sale of noncore assets in our other international segment.
the decreases were partially offset by $200 million related to a fid bonus associated with our australia-west divestiture, gains recognized for contingent payments associated with previous dispositions in our canada and lower 48 segments and gains on sales of certain noncore assets in our lower 48 segment.
other income (loss) increased $1.7 billion in 2021, primarily due to a gain of $1,040 million on our cve common shares in 2021, as compared to a $855 million loss on those shares in 2020.
see note 5
.
purchased commodities increased 125 percent in 2021, primarily in line with higher gas and crude prices and volumes.
production and operating expenses increased $1,350 million in 2021, primarily in line with higher production volumes.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $289 million in 2021, primarily due to transaction and restructuring expenses associated with our concho acquisition and higher compensation and benefits costs, including mark-to-market impacts of certain key employee compensation programs.
exploration expenses decreased
$1,113 million in 2021, primarily due to the absence of 2020 expenses including an $828 million impairment for the entire carrying value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs related to our alaska north slope gas asset, the early cancellation of our
2020 winter exploration program in alaska, and absence of unproved property impairment and dry hole expenses from 2020 for the kamunsu east field in malaysia.
2021
also saw lower dry hole expenses in alaska.
impairments decreased $139 million in 2021, primarily due to the absence of impairments recognized in 2020 for noncore assets in our lower 48 segment partially offset by an impairment in our aplng investment included within our asia pacific segment in 2021.
for additional information, see note 7
and note 13
.
taxes other than income taxes increased
$880 million in 2021, caused primarily by higher commodity prices and higher lower 48 sales volumes.
foreign currency transaction
(gains) losses decreased $50 million in 2021 due to the absence of derivative gains and other remeasurements.

2021 10-k we explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, lng and ngls on a worldwide basis.
at december 31, 2021, our operations were producing in the u.s., norway, canada, australia, indonesia, china, malaysia, qatar and libya.
total production, including libya, of 1,567 mboed increased 440 mboed or 39 percent in 2021 compared with
2020, primarily due to:
●
higher volumes in lower 48 due to our concho acquisition
.
●
new wells online in lower 48, canada, norway, malaysia and alaska.
●
absence of production curtailments, primarily in our north american assets.
●
higher production in libya due to the absence of a forced shutdown of the es sider export terminal and other eastern export terminals.
●
improved well performance in norway, canada, alaska and china.
the increase in production during 2021 was partly offset by:
●
normal field decline.
●
absence of production from australia
-west due to our second quarter
2020 disposition.
production excluding libya for 2021 was 1,527 mboed.
after adjusting for closed acquisitions and dispositions, impacts from 2020 curtailments, 2021 winter storm uri and the conversion of concho two-stream contracted volumes to a three-stream basis, production increased by 28 mboed or 2 percent.
this increase was primarily due to new production from the lower 48 and other development programs across the portfolio, partially offset by normal field decline. production from libya averaged 40 mboed in 2021.

●
normal field decline.
the production decrease was partly offset by:
●
absence of curtailments.
●
improved production at our western north slope assets as a result of net royalty interest changes associated with periodic redetermination.
●
improved performance in the greater prudhoe area and western north slope assets.
●
new wells online across the segment.

to meet our short-
and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, including cash generated from operating activities, proceeds from asset sales, our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our ability to sell securities using our shelf registration statement.
in 2021, the primary uses of our available cash were $8.7 billion for the acquisition of shell permian;
$5.3 billion to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program;
$3.6 billion to repurchase our common stock;
$2.4 billion to pay dividends;
and $1.2
billion for hedging, transaction and restructuring costs.
in 2021, cash and cash equivalents increased by
$2.0
billion to $5.0 billion.
at december 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.0 billion, short-term investments of $0.4 billion, and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility of $6.0 billion, totaling approximately $11.5 billion of liquidity.
we believe current cash balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the "significant changes in capital" section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near- and long-term, including our capital spending program, dividend payments and required debt payments.
significant changes in capital operating activities in 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $17 billion, compared with $4.8 billion for 2020.
the increase is primarily due to higher realized commodity prices and higher sales volumes, mostly resulting from our acquisition of concho.
the increase was partly offset by the $0.8 billion in settlement of oil and gas hedging positions acquired from concho, and approximately
$0.4 billion of transaction and restructuring costs.
our short-
and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, lng and ngls.
prices and margins in our industry have historically been volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control.
absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.
the level of absolute production volumes, as well as product and location mix, impacts our cash flows.
full-year production averaged
1,567 mboed in 2021.
full-year production excluding libya averaged 1,527
mboed.
adjusting for closed acquisitions and dispositions, impacts from 2020 curtailments, 2021 winter storm uri and the conversion of concho two-stream contracted volumes to a three-stream basis, production increased 28 mboed or
2 percent.
first quarter 2022 production is expected to be 1.75 mmboed to 1.79 mmboed.
future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts;
acquisition and disposition of fields; field production decline rates;
new technologies;
operating efficiencies; timing of startups and major turnarounds; political instability;
weather-related disruptions;

2021 10-k and the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost
-effective development.
while we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although generally this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices.
to maintain or grow our production volumes on an ongoing basis, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base.
our proved reserves generally increase as prices rise and decrease as prices decline.
reserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production.
for information on proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the reserve table disclosures contained in "supplementarydata - oil and gas operations."
see "item 1a-risk factors - unless we successfully develop our resources, the scopeof our business will decline, resulting in an adverse impact to our business."
as discussed in the "critical accounting estimates"
section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, reserves may be revised upward or downward each year due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs.
it is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact future reserve quantities.
investing activities in 2021, we invested $5.3 billion in capital expenditures.
capital expenditures invested in 2020 and 2019 were
$4.7 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively.
for information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the
"capital expenditures and investments"
section.
in december 2021, we completed our acquisition of shell's assets in the delaware basin for cash consideration of approximately $8.7 billion after customary adjustments.
we funded this transaction with cash on hand.
we completed our acquisition of concho on january 15, 2021.
the assets acquired in the transaction included
$382
million of cash.
the net impact of these items is recognized within "acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired" on our consolidated sta tement of cash flows.
see note 3.
in 2021, we announced a disposition target of $4 to $5 billion in disposition proceeds by year-end
2023.
only proceeds from transactions announced or initiated in the third quarter of 2021 or later will be counted toward this target.
the proceeds from these transactions will be used in accordance with the company's priorities, including returns of capital to shareholders and reduction of gross debt.
to date, we have achieved $0.3 billion from the sale of noncore assets in our lower 48 segment.
total proceeds from asset dispositions in 2021 were $1.7 billion.
including the $250 million mentioned above, we also received cash proceeds of $1.14 billion from sales of our investment in cve common shares and $244 million of contingent payments related to dispositions completed before
2021.
see note 3.
in may 2021, we announced and began a paced monetization of our investment in cve with the plan to direct proceeds toward our existing share repurchase program.
we expect to fully dispose of our cve common shares by early 2022, however, the sales pace will be guided by market conditions, and we retain discretion to adjust accordingly.
see note 5.
proceeds from asset sales in 2020 were $1.3
billion.
we received cash proceeds of $765 million for the divestiture of our australia-west assets and operations.
we also received proceeds of $359
million and $184 million from the sale of our niobrara interests and waddell ranch interests in the lower 48, respectively.
proceeds from asset sales in 2019 were $3.0
billion, including $2.2 billion for the sale of two conocophillips u.k.
subsidiaries and $350 million for the sale of our 30 percent interest in the greater sunrise fields.

financing activities we have a revolving credit facility totaling $6.0 billion, expiring in may 2023.
our revolving credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance of letters of credit totaling up to $500 million, or as support for our commercial paper program.
the revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or credit ratings.
the facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by conocophillips, or any of its consolidated subsidiaries.
the amount of the facility is not subject to the redetermination prior to its expiration date.
credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the london interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the u.s.
the agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts.
the agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the board of directors.
the revolving credit facility supports conocophillips company's ability to issue up to $6.0 billion of commercial paper, which is primarily a funding source for short-term working capital needs.
commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days.
with no commercial paper outstanding and no direct borrowings or letters of credit, we had access to $6.0 billion in available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility at december 31,
2021.
on january 15, 2021, we completed the acquisition of concho in an all-stock transaction. in the acquisition, we assumed concho's publicly traded debt and in december 2020, we launched an offer to exchange concho's publicly traded debt for debt issued by conocophillips.
there were no impacts to conocophillips'
credit ratings as a result of the debt exchange.
in june 2021, we reaffirmed our commitment to preserving our 'a'
-rated balance sheet by restating our intent to reduce gross debt by $5 billion over the next five years, driving a more resilient and efficient capital structure.

on january 25, 2021, s&p revised the industry risk assessment for the e&p industry to 'moderately high' from
'intermediate' based on a view of increasing risks from the energy transition, price volatility, and weaker profitability.
on february 11, 2021, s&p downgraded its rating of our long-term debt from "a"
to "a

"stable" outlook and affirmed this rating in november 2021.
in october 2021, moody's affirmed its "a3"
rating of our long-term debt and revised its outlook from "stable" to "positive".
in december 2021, fitch affirmed its rating of our long-term debt as "a"
with a "stable" outlook.
we do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, upon downgrade of our credit ratings.
if our credit ratings are downgraded from their current levels, it could increase the cost of corporate debt available to us and restrict our access to the commercial paper markets.
if our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our revolving credit facility.
certain of our project-related contracts, commercial contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post collateral.
many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters of credit as collateral.
at december 31, 2021 and 2020, we had direct bank letters of credit of $337 million and
$249
million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business.
in the event of credit ratings downgrades, we may be required to post additional letters of credit.
we have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the sec under which we have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.

section.
our debt balance at december 31, 2021, was $19.9 billion, an increase of $4.6 billion from the balance at december 31, 2020, driven by debt acquired as part of the concho acquisition.
maturities of debt (including payments for finance leases) due in
2022 of $1.1 billion will be paid from current cash balances and cash generated by operations.
see note 9
.
in december 2021, we announced our expected 2022 return of capital program and the initiation of a three-tier return of capital framework.
the framework is structured to deliver a compelling, growing ordinary dividend and through-cycle share repurchases.
it includes the addition of a discretionary vroc tier.
the vroc will provide a flexible tool for meeting our commitment of returning greater than
30 percent of cash from operating activities during periods where commodity prices are meaningfully higher than our planning price range.
we have set our expected 2022 total capital returns at approximately $8 billion, consisting of distributions from each of the three tiers.
consistent with our commitment to deliver value to shareholders, in 2021, we paid $2.4 billion, $1.75 per share of common stock, in ordinary dividends. this was an increase over 2020 and 2019, when we paid $1.69 and
$1.34 per share of common stock, respectively.
on february 3, 2022, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share, payable march 1, 2022, to stockholders of record at the close of business on february
14, 2022.
on january 14,
2022, we paid the first vroc payment of $0.20 per share to shareholders of record as of january 3, 2022.
on february 3, 2022, we announced a vroc of $0.30 per share, payable on april 14, 2022, to stockholders of record at the close of business on march 31, 2022.
the ordinary dividend and vroc are subject to numerous considerations and will be determined and approved each quarter by the board of directors.
we expect to announce the vroc when we announce our ordinary dividend, but the quarterly payouts will be staggered from the ordinary dividend, resulting in up to eight cash distributions throughout the year.
in late 2016, we initiated our current share repurchase program with board of director's authorization of $25
billion of our common stock.
share repurchases were $3.6
billion, $0.9 billion, and $3.5 billion in 2021, 2020, and
2019, respectively.
as of december 31, 2021, share repurchases since the inception of our current program totaled 247 million shares and $14 billion.
repurchases are made at management's discretion, at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors.
for more information on factors considered when determining the levels of returns of capital see "item 1a-risk factors - our ability to executeour capital return program is subject to certainconsiderations."
in addition to the priorities described above, we have contractual obligations to purchase goods and services of approximately $11.8 billion.
we expect to fulfill $6 billion of these obligations in 2022. these figures exclude purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator.
purchase obligations of $5.3 billion are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third
-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and lng product terminals, to transport, process, treat and store commodities.
purchase obligations of $5.3 billion are related to market-based contracts for commodity product purchases with third parties.
the remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator.

●
u.s. federal clean water act, which governs discharges to water bodies.
●

●
u.s. federal resource conservation and recovery act (rcra), which governs the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid waste.
●
u.s. federal oil pollution act of 1990 (opa90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the u.s.

2021 10-k these laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits, and establish standards and impose obligations for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances and hazardous wastes.
they also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations.
these permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time-consuming.
in addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency's processing of the application.
many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.
many states and foreign countries where we operate also have or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities.
while similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders.
the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards and water quality standards, continue to evolve.
however, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the u.s. and in other countries in which we operate.
notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the u.s.
and canada.
an example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations.
a range of local, state, federal, or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdictions.
although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by various state environmental agencies, and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources.
governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments.
we have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements.
our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change.
we also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations.
such laws and regulations include cercla and rcra and their state equivalents.
longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.
we occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute.
on occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties.
these requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations.
as of december 31, 2021, there were 15 sites around the u.s. in which we were identified as a potentially responsible party under cercla and comparable state laws.
capital resources and liquidity table of contents conocophillips
2021 10-k
60
for most superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low.
although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially.
many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agencies concerned.
prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation.
in some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability.
actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain epa or equivalent state agency approval.
there are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all cercla sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.
expensed environmental costs were $632 million in 2021 and are expected to be about $642 million and
$700 million in 2022 and 2023, respectively.
capitalized environmental costs were $184 million in 2021 and are expected to be about $218 million and $316 million in
2022 and 2023, respectively.
accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis).
many of these liabilities result from cercla, rcra ,
and similar state or international laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct or once conducted operations or at sites where conocophillips-generated waste was disposed.
the accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation but which are not currently the subject of cercla, rcra, or other agency enforcement activities.
the laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites.
if applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries.
in the future, we may incur significant costs under both cercla and rcra.
remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties.
therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.
at december 31, 2021, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $187 million, compared with $180 million at december 31, 2020, for remediation activities in the u.s. and canada.
we expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years.
notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred.
however, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.

2021 10-k climate change continuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on ghg reduction.
these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future.
laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
examples of legislation and precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include:

compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a ghg tax, emission trading scheme or ghg reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation.
such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas.
the ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:
●
whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted.
●
the timing of the introduction of such legislation or regulation.
●
the nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions)
or regulation.
●
the price placed on ghg emissions (either by the market or through a tax).
●
the ghg reductions required.
●
the price and availability of offsets.
●
the amount and allocation of allowances.
●
technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.
●
any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature).
●
whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.
see item 1a-risk factors - existing and future laws, regulationsand internal initiatives relating to global climate changes, such as limitations on ghg emissions may impact or limit our business plans,result in significant expenditures, promote alternative uses of energyor reduce demand for our products and note 11
for information on climate change litigation.
company response to climate
-related risks the company has responded by putting in place a sustainable development risk management standard covering the assessment and registration of significant and high sustainable development risks based on their consequence and likelihood of occurrence.
we have developed a company-wide climate change action plan with the goal of tracking mitigation activities for each climate-related risk included in the corporate sustainable development risk register.
the risks addressed in our climate change action plan fall into four broad categories:
●
ghg-related legislation and regulation.
●
ghg emissions management.
●
physical climate-related impacts.
●
climate-related disclosure and reporting.
emissions are categorized into three different scopes.
gross operated and net equity scope 1 and scope 2 ghg emissions help us understand our climate transition risk.
●
scope 1 emissions are direct ghg emissions from sources that we control or in which we have ownership interest.
●
scope 2 emissions are indirect ghg emissions from the generation of purchased electricity or steam that we consume.
●
scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions from sources that we neither own nor control.

2021 10-k we announced in october 2020 the adoption of a paris-aligned climate risk framework with the objective of implementing a coherent set of choices designed to facilitate the success of our existing exploration and production business through the energy transition.
given the uncertainties remaining about how the energy transition will evolve, the strategy aims to be robust across a range of potential future outcomes.
the strategy is comprised of four pillars:
●
targets
:
our target framework consists of a hierarchy of targets, from a long-term ambition that sets the direction and aim of the strategy, to a medium-term performance target for ghg emissions intensity, to shorter-term targets for flaring and methane intensity reductions.
these performance targets are supported by lower-level internal business unit goals to enable the company to achieve the company-
wide targets.
in september 2021, we increased our interim operational target and have set it to reduce our gross operated and net equity (scope 1 and 2) emissions intensity by
40 to 50 percent from 2016
levels by 2030, an improvement from the previously announced target of 35 to 45 percent on only a gross operated basis, with an ambition to achieve net-zero operated emissions by 2050.
we have joined the world bank flaring initiative to work towards zero routine flaring of associated gas by 2030, with an ambition to meet that goal by 2025.
●
technology choices:
we expanded our marginal abatement cost curve process to provide a broader range of opportunities for emission reduction technology.
●
portfolio choices: our corporate authorization process requires all qualifying projects to include a ghg price in their project approval economics.
different ghg prices are used depending on the region or jurisdiction.
projects in jurisdictions with existing ghg pricing regimes incorporate the existing ghg price and forecast into their economics.
projects where no existing ghg pricing regime exists utilize a scenario forecast from our internally consistent world energy model.
in this way, both existing and emerging regulatory requirements are considered in our decision-making.
the company does not use an estimated market cost of ghg emissions when assessing reserves in jurisdictions without existing ghg regulations
.
this is in contrast to changes to the cost of existing ghg emission regulations which can impact our reserves calculations.
●
external engagement: our external engagement aims to differentiate conocophillips within the oil and gas sector with our approach to managing climate-related risk.
we are a founding member of the climate leadership council (clc), an international policy institute founded in collaboration with business and environmental interests to develop a carbon dividend plan.
participation in the clc provides another opportunity for ongoing dialogue about carbon pricing and framing the issues in alignment with our public policy principles.
we also belong to and fund americans for carbon dividends, the education and advocacy branch of the clc.

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
see note 1
for descriptions of our major accounting policies.
certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used.
these critical accounting estimates are discussed with the audit and finance committee of the board of directors at least annually.
we believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.
oil and gas accounting accounting for oil and gas activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry.
the acquisition of g&g seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs.
however, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been recognized.
property acquisition costs at year-end 2021, we held $9.3 billion of net capitalized unproved property costs which consisted primarily of individually significant and pooled leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, and to a lesser extent, suspended exploratory wells and capitalized interest.
this amount increased by $6.9 billion at december 31, 2021 as compared to december 31, 2020, primarily due to the concho and shell permian acquisitions in the permian basin where we have an ongoing significant and active development program.
outside of the permian basin, the remaining
$2.0 billion is concentrated in 9 major development areas.
management periodically assesses our unproved property for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization.
for individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date.
for insignificant individual leasehold acquisition costs, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves, including estimates of future expirations, and pools that leasehold information with others in similar geographic areas.
for prospects in areas with limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high.
this judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense.
this judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively.
exploratory costs for exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or "suspended,"
on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify development.

65
conocophillips
2021 10-k if exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made.
the accounting notion of "sufficient progress" is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable.
often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control.
exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained.
once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves.
at year-end 2021, total suspended well costs were $660 million, compared with $682 million at year-end 2020.
for additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see note 6
.
proved reserves engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information.
reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits.
the reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons.
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of "proved"
reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company's operations.
there are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as "proved."
our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines.
we have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates.
see oil and gas supplemental disclosures for additional information.
proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field.
also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will reach the end of its economic life is based on 12-month average prices and current costs.
this date estimates when production will end and affects the amount of estimated reserves.
therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes.
generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise.
our proved reserves include estimat ed quantities related to pscs, reported under the "economic interest"
method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs.
if costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices.
we would expect reserves from these contracts to decrease when product prices rise and increase when prices decline.
the estimation of proved reserves is also important to the income statement because the proved reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the dd&a of the capitalized costs for that asset.
at year-end 2021, the net book value of productive pp&e subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $52 billion and the dd&a recorded on these assets in
2021 was approximately $7.0 billion.
the estimated proved reserves for our consolidated operations were 2.5 billion boe at the end of 2020 and 4.0 billion boe at the end of 2021.
if the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 10 percent across all calculations, before-tax dd&a in 2021 would have increased by an estimated
$774 million.

business combination-valuationof oil and gas properties for recent transactions, management applied the principles of acquisition accounting under fasb asc topic 805

"business combinations" and allocated the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.
estimating the fair values involved making various assumptions, of which the most significant assumptions relate to the fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and gas properties.
management utilized a discounted cash flow approach, based on market participant assumptions, and engaged third party valuation experts in preparing fair value estimates.
significant inputs incorporated within the valuation include future commodity price assumptions and production profiles of reserve estimates, the pace of drilling plans, future operating and development costs, inflation rates, and discount rates using a market
-based weighted average cost of capital determined at the time of the acquisition.
when estimating the fair value of unproved properties, additional risk-weighting adjustments are applied to probable and possible reserves.
the assumptions and inputs incorporated within the fair value estimates are subject to considerable management judgement and are based on industry, market, and economic conditions prevalent at the time of the acquisition.
although we based these estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable, these estimates are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results could differ.
see note 3
.
impairments long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group.
if there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, a recoverability test is performed using management's assumptions for prices, volumes and future development plans.
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows before income-taxes is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment in the periods in which the determination is made.
individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets-generally on a field-by-field basis for e&p assets.
because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible.
the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on estimated future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available evidence at the date of review.
differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period.
see note 6
and note 7
.
investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred.
such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment's carrying amount.
when such a condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment's carrying value and its estimated fair value.
when determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee's financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment.
since quoted market prices are usually not available, the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate.
differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period.

2021 10-k asset retirement obligations and environmental costs under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites.
our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in alaska.
fair value is estimated using a
present value approach, incorporating assumptions about estimated amounts and timing of settlements and impacts of the use of technologies.
estimating future asset removal costs requires significant judgement.
most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs.
the carrying value of our asset retirement obligation estimate is sensitive to inputs such as asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, which are all subject to change between the time of initial recognition of the liability and future settlement of our obligation.
normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to dd&a over the remaining life of the assets.
however, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in pp&e due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties.
in addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain environmental-related projects.
these are primarily related to remediation activities required by canada and various states within the u.s.
at exploration and production sites.
future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties.
see note 8
.
projected benefit obligations the actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees.
due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements.
ultimately, we will be required to fund all vested benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time.
projected benefit obligations are particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption.
a 100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by $1.0 billion.
benefit expense is sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions.
a 100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $70 million, while a 100 basis-point decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $60 million.
in determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans.
we are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans during the year could exceed the total of service and interest components of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of a portion of unrecognized net actuarial losses and gains.
these benefit payments are based on decisions by plan participants and are therefore difficult to predict.
in the event there is a significant reduction in the expected years of future service of present employees or the elimination of the accrual of defined benefits for some or all of their future services for a significant number of employees, we could recognize a curtailment gain or loss.

contingencies a number of claims and lawsuits are made against the company arising in the ordinary course of business.
management exercises judgment related to accounting and disclosure of these claims which includes losses, damages, and underpayments associated with environmental remediation, tax, contracts, and other legal disputes.
as we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to amounts recognized and disclosed considering changes to the probability of additional losses and potential exposure.
however, actual losses can and do vary from estimates for a variety of reasons including legal, arbitration, or other third-party decisions; settlement discussions;
evaluation of scope of damages; interpretation of regulatory or contractual terms; expected timing of future actions; and proportion of liability shared with other responsible parties.
estimated future costs related to contingencies are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.
for additional information on contingent liabilities, see the "contingencies"
section within "capital resources and liquidity" and note 11
.
income taxes we are subject to income taxation in numerous jurisdictions worldwide.
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns.
we routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
in assessing the need for adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider all available positive and negative evidence.
positive evidence includes reversals of temporary differences, forecasts of future taxable income, assessment of future business assumptions and applicable tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible.
negative evidence includes losses in recent years as well as the forecasts of future net income (loss) in the realizable period.
in making our assessment regarding valuation allowances, we weight the evidence based on objectivity.
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions and the assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our u.s.
federal income taxes
(particularly as related to prevai ling oil and gas prices).
see note 17
.
we regularly assess and, if required, establish accruals for uncertain tax positions that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where we operate.
we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position.
these accruals for uncertain tax positions are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, court proceedings, changes in applicable tax laws, including tax case rulings and legislative guidance, or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.

item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward-looking statements this report contains some predictive statements about future events, including statements related to conditions in domestic or global economies, conditions in steel and recycled metals market places, steel dynamics' revenues, costs of purchased materials, future profitability and earnings, and the operation of new, existing or planned facilities. these statements, which we generally precede or accompany by such typical conditional words as "anticipate", "intend", "believe", "estimate", "plan", "seek", "project", or "expect", or by the words "may", "will", or "should", are intended to be made as "forward-looking", subject to many risks and uncertainties, within the safe harbor protections of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these statements speak only as of this date and are based upon information and assumptions, which we consider reasonable as of this date, concerning our businesses and the environments in which they operate. such predictive statements are not guarantees of future performance, and we undertake no duty to update or revise any such statements. some factors that could cause such forward-looking statements to turn out differently than anticipated include: (1) domestic and global economic factors; (2) global steelmaking overcapacity and imports of steel, together with increased scrap prices; (3) pandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other health issues, such as the covid-19 pandemic; (4) the cyclical nature of the steel industry and the industries we serve; (5) volatility and major fluctuations in prices and availability of scrap metal, scrap substitutes, and our potential inability to pass higher costs on to our customers; (6) cost and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil, or other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions; (7) increased environmental, greenhouse gas emissions and sustainability considerations or regulations; (8) compliance with and changes in environmental and remediation requirements; (9) significant price and other forms of competition from other steel producers, scrap processors and alternative materials; (10) availability of an adequate source of supply of scrap for our metals recycling operations; (11) cybersecurity threats and risks to the security of our sensitive data and information technology; (12) the implementation of our growth strategy; (13) litigation and legal compliance; (14) unexpected equipment downtime or shutdowns; (15) governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew some of our licenses and permits; (16) our senior unsecured credit facility contains, and any future financing agreements may contain, restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility; and (17) the impacts of impairment charges.
more specifically, we refer you to our more detailed explanation of these and other factors and risks that may cause such predictive statements to turn out differently, as set forth in the sections titled special note regarding forward-looking statements at the beginning of part i of this report and item 1a. risk factors, as well as in other subsequent reports we file with the securities and exchange commission. these reports are available publicly on the securities and exchange commission website, www.sec.gov, and on our website, www.steeldynamics.com under "investors - sec filings."
operating statement classifications net sales. net sales from our operations are a factor of volumes shipped, product mix and related pricing. we charge premium prices for certain grades of steel, product dimensions, certain smaller volumes, and for value-added processing or coating of our steel products. except for the steel fabrication operations, we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated returns and claims from these sales at the point in time control of the product transfers to the customer, upon shipment or delivery. our steel fabrication operations recognize revenues over time based on completed fabricated tons to date as a percentage of total tons required for each contract.
costs of goods sold. our costs of goods sold represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products. the principal elements of these costs are scrap and scrap substitutes (which represent the most significant single component of our consolidated costs of goods sold), steel substrate, direct and indirect labor and related benefits, alloys, zinc, transportation and freight, repairs and maintenance, utilities such as electricity and natural gas, and depreciation.
36
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales, finance and accounting, and administrative departments. these costs include, among other items, labor and related benefits, professional services, insurance premiums, and property taxes. company-wide profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets are each separately presented in the statement of income.
interest expense, net of capitalized interest. interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt, net of interest costs that are required to be capitalized during the construction period of certain capital investment projects.
other (income) expense, net. other income consists of interest income earned on our temporary cash deposits and short-term investments; any other non-operating income activity, including income from non-consolidated investments accounted for under the equity method. other expense consists of any non-operating costs, such as certain acquisition and financing expenses.
2021 overview during 2021, domestic steel demand was strong throughout the year, supported most significantly by the construction, automotive, and industrial sectors. customer steel inventories also remained historically low, as steel supply was not sufficient to meet robust demand requirements during much of the year. this strong market environment drove significantly higher steel selling prices, resulting in meaningful steel segment metal spread expansion. our metals recycling operations benefited from improved domestic steel mill utilization rates in 2021, driving increased shipments, pricing, and metal spread. the non-residential construction market remained strong, driving increased shipments and order backlog, pricing and metal spread in our steel fabrication operations. the symbiotic relationship among our three operating segments resulted in record company-wide financial and operational performance during 2021.
we achieved record 2021 operational and financial results.
●   record steel and steel fabrication shipments of 11.2 million and 789,000 tons, respectively

●   record net sales of $18.4 billion

●   record operating income of $4.3 billion and net income of $3.2 billion

●   record steel, steel fabrication, and metals recycling operating income of $4.4 billion, $365.3 million and $182.0 million, respectively

●   record cash flow from operations of $2.2 billion

●   share repurchases of $1.1 billion of our common stock, representing 8% of our outstanding shares

consolidated operating income for 2021 increased $3.5 billion, more than four times, to $4.3 billion, compared to $847.1 million in 2020. net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. for 2021 increased $2.7 billion, more than four and a half times, to $3.2 billion, compared to 2020. diluted earnings per share attributable to steel dynamics, inc. was $15.56 for 2021, compared to $2.59 for 2020.

segment results 2021 vs. 2020
during 2021, domestic steel consumption was strong from the automotive, construction, and industrial sectors. these market dynamics, along with historically low customer inventories throughout the supply chain, drove increased shipments and product pricing for our steel operations compared to 2020, which was negatively impacted by covid-19 most notably during the second quarter of the year. steel operations segment shipments increased 4% in 2021, as compared to 2020, with average selling prices increasing 81%, or $621 per ton. net sales for the steel operations were 88% higher in 2021 when compared to 2020, due to these increased average steel selling prices and volumes.
metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant steel manufacturing cost, generally comprising approximately 55% to 65% of our steel mill operations' manufacturing costs. our metallic raw material cost consumed in our steel mills increased $179 per net ton, or 67%, in 2021 compared to 2020.
as a result of average selling prices increasing more than scrap costs, metal spread (which we define as the difference between average steel mill selling prices and the cost of ferrous scrap consumed in our steel mills) increased 86% in 2021 compared to 2020. due to this metal spread expansion, coupled with the 4% increase in steel segment shipments, operating income for the steel operations increased nearly four times, to $4.4 billion, in 2021 compared to 2020.
metals recycling operations segment

metals recycling operations includes both ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal processing, transportation, marketing, brokerage, and scrap management services. our steel mills utilize a large portion (approximately 66% in 2021 and 69% in 2020) of the ferrous scrap sold by our metals recycling operations as raw material in our steelmaking operations, and the remainder is sold to other consumers, such as other steel manufacturers and foundries. metals recycling operations accounted for 12% and 11% of our consolidated net sales during 2021 and 2020, respectively.

segment results 2021 vs. 2020
our metals recycling operations benefited from strong steel market demand during 2021, driving increased domestic steel mill utilization and strong ferrous scrap shipments throughout the year. domestic steel mill utilization rates increased to approximately 81% in 2021 from 68% in the prior year, which was depressed due to the impact of covid-19 during most notably the second quarter of 2020. net sales for our metals recycling operations increased 91% in 2021 as compared to 2020, driven by increased shipments, including a full year of activity related to our august 2020 acquired mexican scrap operations, and pricing. ferrous scrap average selling prices increased 73% during 2021 compared to 2020, while nonferrous average selling prices increased 53%. ferrous metal spread (which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased scrap) increased 35%, while nonferrous metal spread increased 61% in 2021 compared to 2020. metals recycling operations operating income in 2021 of $182.0 million improved $149.0 million, or four and a half times, from 2020, due to increased ferrous and nonferrous shipments and metal spread.
steel fabrication operations segment

steel fabrication operations include seven new millennium building systems joist and deck plants located throughout the united states, and in northern mexico. revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of steel joists, trusses, girders and steel deck used within the non-residential construction industry. steel fabrication operations accounted for 10% and 9% of our consolidated net sales during 2021 and 2020, respectively.
40
segment results 2021 vs. 2020
our steel fabrication operations benefited in 2021 from a robust non-residential construction market, as order activity was strong throughout the year, resulting in record shipments, as well as a record customer order backlog at the end of 2021, and higher selling prices, due to the strength of warehouse construction related to distribution and data centers. net sales for the segment increased 95% during 2021, compared to 2020, as shipments increased 19%, and average selling prices increased 64%, or $874 per ton.
the purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of production for our steel fabrication operations, historically representing approximately two-thirds of the total cost of manufacturing, however closer to three-fourths in 2021 with the increased steel costs. the average cost of steel consumed increased 82% in 2021, as compared to 2020, consistent with increased steel selling prices in our steel operations. as a result of selling prices per ton increasing more than steel input costs per ton, metal spread (which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased steel) increased 45% in 2021 compared to 2020. this expanded metal spread, coupled with record shipments, resulted in record operating income of $365.3 million in 2021 compared to $120.6 million in 2020.
other operations

consolidated results 2021 vs. 2020
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses increased 35%, or $166.5 million, to $644.0 million during 2021 compared to 2020, representing 3.5% and 5.0% of net sales, respectively. this increase relates primarily to increased 2021 profitability, and increased southwest-sinton flat roll division start-up expenses of $70.6 million.
profit sharing expense was $388.1 million in 2021 (including $19.6 million of additional company-wide special compensation awarded to all non-executive team members in recognition of the company's exceptional annual performance), an increase of $326.4 million from the $61.7 million earned during 2020. the company-wide profit sharing plan represents 8% of pretax earnings.
41
interest expense, net of capitalized interest. during 2021, interest expense of $57.2 million decreased $37.7 million from the $94.9 million incurred during 2020, due to decreased interest expense related to our june 2020 and october 2020 refinancing of $1.6 billion of high yield senior notes with lower interest rate senior notes, and a $26.5 million increase in capitalized interest in 2021, related to the construction of our new southwest-sinton flat roll division.
income tax expense. income tax expense of $962.3 million in 2021, at an effective income tax rate of 22.9%, increased 615% from the $134.7 million, at an effective income tax rate of 19.1%, during 2020, consistent with increased income before income taxes. the lower effective tax rate in 2020 related primarily to the release of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance and increased federal tax credits. refer to note 4. income taxes to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information.
included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31, 2021, are potential benefits of $16.8 million that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. we recognize interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies on a net-of-tax basis in income tax expense. during the year ended december 31, 2021, we recognized benefits from the decrease of interest expense and penalties of $205,000, net of tax. in addition to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above, we accrued $561,000 for the payment of interest and penalties at december 31, 2021.
we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions. the tax years 2018 through 2020 remain open to examination by the internal revenue service and various state and local jurisdictions. at this time, we do not believe there will be any significant examination adjustments that would result in a material change to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months in an amount ranging from zero to $3.3 million, as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations and other federal and state income tax audits.
liquidity and capital resources capital resources and long-term debt. our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for, among other things, the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our operations, and to remain in compliance with environmental laws. our short-term and long-term liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements, capital expenditures, including expansion projects, principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness (no significant principal payments until 2024), dividends to our shareholders, and potential stock repurchases and acquisitions or investments. we have met and intend to continue to meet these liquidity requirements primarily with available cash and cash provided by operations, and long-term borrowings, and we also have availability under our unsecured revolver. our liquidity at december 31, 2021, is as follows (in thousands):

cash and equivalents                  $1,243,868
unsecured revolver availability               1,187,960
total liquidity                       $2,431,828
our total outstanding debt remained consistent at $3.1 billion during 2021. our total long-term debt to capitalization ratio (representing our long-term debt, including current maturities, divided by the sum of our long-term debt, redeemable noncontrolling interests, and our total stockholders' equity) decreased to 33.0% at december 31, 2021, from 41.6% at december 31, 2020, due to the growth in stockholders' equity from undistributed 2021 earnings.
our unsecured credit agreement has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (facility), which provides a $1.2 billion unsecured revolver, and matures in december 2024. subject to certain conditions, we have the opportunity to increase the facility size by $500.0 million. the unsecured revolver is available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes. the facility contains financial covenants and other covenants pertaining to our ability to incur indebtedness and permit liens on certain assets. our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the unsecured revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants. at december 31, 2021, we had $1.2 billion of availability on the revolver, $12.0 million of outstanding letters of credit and other obligations which reduce availability, and there were no borrowings outstanding.
42
the financial covenants under our facility state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.50:1.00. our interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our last-twelve-months (ltm) consolidated adjusted ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and certain other non-cash transactions as allowed in the facility) by our ltm gross interest expense, less amortization of financing fees. in addition, a debt to capitalization ratio of not more than 0.60:1.00 must be maintained. at december 31, 2021, our interest coverage ratio and debt to capitalization ratio were 45.04:1.00 and 0.33:1.00, respectively. we were, therefore, in compliance with these covenants at december 31, 2021, and we anticipate we will continue to be in compliance during the next twelve months.
working capital. we generated cash flow from operations of $2.2 billion in 2021. operational working capital (representing amounts invested in trade receivables and inventories, less current liabilities other than income taxes payable and debt) increased $1.7 billion to $3.3 billion at december 31, 2021, due primarily to increased accounts receivable and inventory, consistent with increased net sales, inventory volumes and associated costs.
capital investments. during 2021, we invested $1.0 billion in property, plant and equipment, primarily within our steel operations segment, compared with $1.2 billion invested during 2020. of these amounts, $831.0 million related to our southwest-sinton flat roll steel division in 2021, and $927.7 million in 2020. we enter 2022 with ample liquidity of $2.4 billion to provide for our currently planned 2022 capital requirements.
cash dividends. as a reflection of continued confidence in our current and future cash flow generation ability and financial position, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 4% to $0.26 per share in the first quarter 2021 (from $0.25 per share in 2020), resulting in declared cash dividends of $210.9 million during 2021, compared to $210.5 million during 2020. we paid cash dividends of $213.0 million and $209.2 million during 2021 and 2020, respectively. our board of directors, along with executive management, approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis. the determination to pay cash dividends in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors, after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, outstanding indebtedness, current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans.
other. in february 2020, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $500.0 million of our common stock. this program was exhausted in july 2021. in july 2021, our board of directors authorized an additional share repurchase program of up to $1.0 billion of our common stock. under the share repurchase programs, purchases take place as and when we determine in open market or private transactions made based upon the market price of our common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities or growth projects, our cash flows from operations, and general economic conditions. the share repurchase programs do not require us to acquire any specific number of shares, and may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated by us at any time. the share repurchase programs do not have an expiration date. we repurchased 16.9 million shares of our common stock for $1.1 billion during 2021. as of december 31, 2021, we had $383.4 million remaining available to purchase under the 2021 share repurchase program. see part ii, item 5. market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for additional information.
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which, in turn, will depend upon general economic, financial, and business conditions, along with competition, legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control. in addition, we cannot assure that our operating results, cash flows, access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future. we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth, cash flows from operations, together with other available sources of funds, including borrowings under our revolver, if necessary, will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, funding working capital requirements, and anticipated capital expenditures noted above.
43
contractual obligations and other long-term liabilities we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations, including purchase obligations, as defined by the securities and exchange commission. a "purchase obligation" is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.
long-term debt and estimated interest. refer to note 3. long-term debt to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for our long-term debt maturities. estimated interest payments on our senior unsecured notes were determined based on their outstanding balances through maturity at their contractual interest rates, as detailed in note 3. estimated interest payments also include a 0.175% commitment fee on our available revolver, and an average interest rate of 1.9% on our other debt of $105.4 million. our estimated interest payments are $100.8 million, $99.1 million, $98.4 million, $80.3 million, $75.0 million, for the years 2022 through 2026, respectively, and $447.7 million thereafter.
purchase obligations. we have commitments for the purchase of commodities such as electricity, water, natural gas and its transportation services, fuel, air products, zinc, and electrodes. refer to note 9. commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for this information.
construction commitments. we have firm contracts with various vendors for the completion of certain construction projects at our various divisions at december 31, 2021. refer to note 9. commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for this information.
lease commitments. we have entered into operating leases relating principally to transportation and other equipment, and some real estate. refer to note 12. leases to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for this information.
unrecognized tax benefits. we expect to make cash outlays in the future related to our unrecognized tax benefits; however, due to the uncertainty of the timing, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. refer to note 4. income taxes to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for this information.
other matters environmental and other contingencies we have incurred, and in the future will continue to incur, capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control, remediation, monitoring and compliance. during 2021, we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately $44.5 million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately $37.0 million, of which approximately $33.8 million is related to the construction of our new southwest-sinton flat roll division. of the costs incurred during 2021 for monitoring and compliance, approximately 72% were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in our steelmaking processes and other facilities, in accordance with legal requirements. we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately $86,000 at all of our facilities during 2021. we have an accrual of $5.8 million recorded for environmental remediation related to our metals recycling operations, and $2.6 million related to our idled minnesota ironmaking operations. we believe, apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and any future manufacturing facilities, that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. however, environmental laws and regulations evolve and change, and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future, such as the impact of united states government or various governmental agencies introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential of climate change.

critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions. we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition and credit losses. except for our steel fabrication operations, we recognize revenues at the point in time the performance obligation is satisfied, and control of the product is transferred to the customer upon shipment or delivery, at the amount of consideration the company expects to receive, including any variable consideration. the variable consideration included in the company's steel operations segment contracts, which is not constrained, include estimated product returns and customer claims based on historical experience, and may include volume rebates which are recorded on an expected value basis. our steel fabrication operations segment recognizes revenue over time at the amount of consideration the company expects to receive. revenue is measured on an output method representing completed fabricated tons to date as a percentage of total tons required for each contract. the company does not exercise significant judgments in determining the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations or the transaction price. provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on historical experience. if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends, additional provision may be necessary. the allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable is based on our reasonable estimate of known credit risks and historical experience, adjusted for current and anticipated economic and other pertinent factors affecting our customers, that may differ from historical experience.
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers, which in steel operations are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to numerous industry sectors, including the construction, automotive, manufacturing, transportation, heavy and agriculture equipment, and pipe and tube (including octg) markets. our metals recycling operations sell ferrous scrap to steel mills and foundries, and nonferrous scrap, such as copper, brass, aluminum and stainless steel to, among others, ingot manufacturers, copper refineries and mills, smelters, and specialty mills. our steel fabrication operations sell fabricated steel joists and deck primarily to the non-residential construction market. we mitigate our exposure to credit risk, which we generally extend initially on an unsecured basis, by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary, such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the customer receivable. if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate for any reason, resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowance may be required.
inventories. we record inventories at lower of cost or net realizable value. cost is determined using a weighted average cost method for raw materials and supplies, and on a first-in, first-out, basis for other inventory. we record amounts required, if any, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value as a charge to cost of goods sold. if product selling prices were to decline in future periods, further write-down of inventory could result, specifically raw material inventory such as scrap or steel substrate purchased during periods of peak market pricing.
impairments of long-lived tangible and definite-lived intangible assets. we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. impairment losses are recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying amounts. the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount. we consider various factors and determine whether an impairment test is necessary, including by way of examples, a significant and prolonged deterioration in operating results and/or projected cash flows, significant changes in the extent or manner in
45
which an asset is used, technological advances with respect to assets which would potentially render them obsolete, our strategy and capital planning, and the economic environment in markets to be served. when determining future cash flows and if necessary, fair value, we must make judgments as to the expected utilization of assets and estimated future cash flows related to those assets. we consider historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all other available information at the time the estimates are made. those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate.
a long-lived asset is classified as held for sale upon meeting specified criteria related to ability and intent to sell. an asset classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. as of december 31, 2021, and 2020, the company reported $7.1 million and $7.2 million, respectively, of assets held for sale within other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet. an impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset held for sale to its fair value less cost to sell. for assets determined to be classified as held for sale in the year ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, the asset carrying amounts approximated their fair value less cost to sell. the company determined fair value using level 3 fair value inputs as provided for under asc 820, consisting of information provided by brokers and other external sources along with management's own assumptions.
events occurred during the fourth quarter of 2020, that represented impairment indicators related to the company's noncore oil and gas joint ventures. therefore, the company undertook a fourth quarter 2020 assessment of the recoverability of the carrying amounts of these joint ventures' property, plant and equipment. based on the joint ventures' outlook at the time of this 2020 assessment, the company concluded that the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment were fully impaired. this assessment resulted in a total non-cash asset impairment charge of $19.4 million, which include amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $2.4 million, that in total served to reduce net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by $12.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2020.
goodwill.
our goodwill, relating to various business combinations, consisted of the following at december 31 (in thousands):

2021                 2020
steel operations segment                   $272,133             $272,133
metals recycling operations segment               179,777              183,168
steel fabrication operations segment                1,925                1,925
$453,835             $457,226
at least once annually (as of october 1), or when indicators of impairment exist, the company performs an impairment test for goodwill. goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally one level below the company's operating segments. the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows utilizing a risk-adjusted discount rate to calculate the net present value of future cash flows (income approach), and for some years by using a market approach based upon an analysis of valuation metrics of comparable peer companies, using level 3 fair value inputs as provided for under asc 820. if the fair value exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit, there is no impairment. if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, with the impairment loss not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the discounted cash flows method (income approach) include: (a) expected cash flows for the five-year period following the testing date (including market share, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce and estimated capital needs); (b) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit; and (c) a risk-adjusted discount rate based on management's best estimate of market participants' after-tax weighted average cost of capital and market risk premiums. key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the market approach include the expected revenues and cash flows in the next year. we consider historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all
46
available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated. those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate.
goodwill acquired in past transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on operating plans and economic conditions at the time of acquisition. consequently, if operating results and/or economic conditions deteriorate after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets. a deterioration of economic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and/or discount rates. additionally, we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. as a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed. therefore, we may recognize an impairment in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts.
our fourth quarter 2021, 2020, and 2019 annual goodwill impairment analyses did not result in any impairment charges. management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that our reporting units will fail the goodwill impairment test in the near term, as the determined fair value of the reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value by more than an insignificant amount. changes in judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment, including expected future operating cash flows and discount rate, could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future and could result in an impairment of goodwill.
income taxes. we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements. this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. we also establish reserves to reduce some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain. we adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited by a taxing authority and finally resolved. the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. a tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the "more likely than not" recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears. settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.

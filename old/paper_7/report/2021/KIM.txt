item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this form 10-k. historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the consolidated statements of income contained in the consolidated financial statements, including trends, should not be taken as indicative of future operations.
the consolidated financial statements of the company include the accounts of the company, its wholly owned subsidiaries and all entities in which the company has a controlling interest, including where the company has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with the consolidation guidance of the fasb accounting standards codification.  the company applies these provisions to each of its joint venture investments to determine whether the cost, equity or consolidation method of accounting is appropriate.  the company evaluates performance on a property specific or transactional basis and does not distinguish its principal business or group its operations on a geographical basis for purposes of measuring performance. accordingly, the company believes it has a single reportable segment for disclosure purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap").
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes. in preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. these estimates are based on, but not limited to, historical results, industry standards and current economic conditions, giving due consideration to materiality. the most significant assumptions and estimates relate to the recoverability of trade accounts receivable, depreciable lives, valuation of real estate and intangible assets and liabilities, and valuation of joint venture investments and other investments. application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties, and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates.
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties, investments in joint ventures and other investments. the company's reported net earnings are directly affected by management's estimate of impairments.
25
trade accounts receivable the company reviews its trade accounts receivable, including its straight-line rent receivable, related to base rents, straight-line rent, expense reimbursements and other revenues for collectability. when evaluating the probability of the collection of the lessee's total accounts receivable, including the corresponding straight-line rent receivable balance on a lease-by-lease basis, the company considered the effects covid-19 has had on its tenants, including the corresponding straight-line rent receivable. the company's analysis of its accounts receivable included (i) customer credit worthiness, (ii) assessment of risk associated with the tenant, and (iii) current economic trends. in addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and considerations are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition bankruptcy claims. the company includes provision for doubtful accounts in revenues from rental properties, net. if a lessee's accounts receivable balance is considered uncollectible, the company will write-off the receivable balances associated with the lease and will only recognize lease income on a cash basis. in addition to the lease-specific collectability assessment, the analysis also recognizes a general reserve, as a reduction to revenues from rental properties, for its portfolio of operating lease receivables which are not expected to be fully collectible based on the company's historical and current collection experience and the potential for settlement of arrears. although the company estimates uncollectible receivables and provides for them through charges against revenues from rental properties, actual results may differ from those estimates. if the company subsequently determines that it is probable it will collect the remaining lessee's lease payments under the lease term, the company will then reinstate the straight-line balance and the lease income will then be limited to the lesser of (i) the straight-line rental income or (ii) the lease payments that have been collected from the lessee.
real estate valuation of real estate, and intangible assets and liabilities the company's investments in real estate properties are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. significant renovations and replacements, which improve and extend the life of the asset, are capitalized.
transaction costs related to acquisitions that qualify as asset acquisitions are capitalized as part of the cost basis of the acquired assets, while transaction costs for acquisitions that are deemed to be business combinations are expensed as incurred. also, upon acquisition of real estate operating properties in either an asset acquisition or business combination, the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building, building improvements and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases, in-place leases, and tenant relationships, where applicable), assumed debt and redeemable units issued at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date. fair value is determined based on a market approach, which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:
buildings and building improvements (in years)                                                 5 to 50

fixtures, leasehold and tenant improvements (including certain identified intangible assets)   terms of leases or useful lives, whichever is shorter the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties. these assessments have a direct impact on the company's net earnings.
on a continuous basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance, changes in anticipated holding period, general market conditions and delays of development, that the value of the real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may be impaired. a property value is considered impaired only if management's estimate of current and projected operating cash flows, net of anticipated construction and leasing costs (undiscounted and unleveraged), of the property over its anticipated hold period is less than the net carrying value of the property. such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future costs of materials and labor, operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. to the extent impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. the company's estimated fair values are primarily based upon estimated sales prices from signed contracts or letters of intent from third-parties, discounted cash flow models or third-party appraisals. estimated fair values that are based on discounted cash flow models include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period. capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in these models are based upon unobservable rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates.
see footnote 3, 4 and 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
valuation of joint venture investments and other investments
26
on a continuous basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of the company's investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired. an investment's value is impaired only if management's estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be other-than-temporary. to the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment. estimated fair values which are based on discounted cash flow models include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period, capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in these models are based upon unobservable rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates.
see footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements, "summary of significant accounting policies", for further discussion of the company's accounting policies and estimates.
executive overview kimco realty corporation is north america's largest publicly traded owner and operator of open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers, including mixed-use assets. the executive officers are engaged in the day-to-day management and operation of real estate exclusively with the company, with nearly all operating functions, including leasing, asset management, maintenance, construction, legal, finance and accounting, administered by the company.
weingarten merger on august 3, 2021, weingarten realty investors ("weingarten") merged with and into the company, with the company continuing as the surviving public company (the "merger"), pursuant to the definitive merger agreement (the "merger agreement") between the company and weingarten which was entered into on april 15, 2021. the merger brought together two industry-leading retail real estate platforms with highly complementary portfolios and created the preeminent open-air shopping center and mixed-use real estate owner in the country. as a result of the merger, the company acquired 149 properties, including 30 held through joint venture programs. the increased scale in targeted growth markets, coupled with a broader pipeline of redevelopment opportunities, has positioned the combined company to create significant value for its shareholders. under the terms of the merger agreement, each weingarten common share was entitled to 1.408 newly issued shares of the company's common stock plus $2.89 in cash, subject to certain adjustments specified in the merger agreement.
on july 15, 2021, weingarten's board of trust managers declared a special cash distribution of $0.69 per weingarten common share (the "special distribution") payable on august 2, 2021 to shareholders of record on july 28, 2021. the special distribution was paid in connection with the merger and to satisfy reit taxable income distribution requirements. under the terms of the merger agreement, weingarten's payment of the special distribution adjusted the cash consideration paid by the company at the closing of the merger from $2.89 per weingarten common share to $2.20 per weingarten common share and had no impact on the payment of the share consideration of 1.408 newly issued shares of company common stock for each weingarten common share owned immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.
the total purchase price of the merger was $4.1 billion, which consists primarily of 179.9 million shares of the company's common stock issued in exchange for weingarten common shares, plus $281.1 million of cash consideration. the total purchase price was calculated based on the closing price of the company's common stock on august 3, 2021, which was $20.78 per share. at the effective time of the merger, each weingarten common share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than any shares owned directly by the company or weingarten and in each case not held on behalf of third parties) was converted into 1.408 shares of newly issued shares of the company's common stock. see footnote 2 to the notes to the company's consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the merger.
covid-19 pandemic the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that adversely affected businesses, economies and financial markets worldwide. the covid-19 pandemic significantly impacted the retail sector in which the company operates. the majority of the company's tenants and their operations have been, and may continue to be impacted. through the duration of the pandemic, a substantial number of tenants had to temporarily or permanently close their business, shortened their operating hours or offer reduced services for some period of time.
27
the development and distribution of covid-19 vaccines has assisted in allowing many restrictions to be lifted, providing a path to recovery. the u.s. economy continues to build upon the reopening trend as businesses reopen to full capacity and stimulus is flowing through to the consumer. the overall economy continues to recover but several issues including lack of qualified employees, inflation risk, supply chain bottlenecks and covid-19 variants have impacted the pace of the recovery.
the extent to which the covid-19 pandemic impacts the company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, in the near term, will continue to depend on future developments, which continue to be uncertain, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of covid-19, variants, the distribution and effectiveness as well as the willingness to take the vaccines, the impact of covid-19 on economic activity, the effect of covid-19 on the company's tenants and their businesses, the ability of tenants to make their rental payments and any additional closures of tenants' businesses.
the company continues to monitor the impact of covid-19 on the company's business, tenants and industry as a whole.  the magnitude and duration of the covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the company's operations and liquidity remains uncertain as the pandemic continues to evolve globally and within the united states. the company will continue to monitor the economic, financial, and social conditions resulting from the covid-19 pandemic and will assess its asset portfolio for any impairment indicators. in addition, the company will continue to monitor for any material or adverse effects resulting from the covid-19 pandemic. if the company determines that any of its assets are impaired, the company would be required to take impairment charges, and such amounts could be material.
although the company continues to see an increase in collections of rental payments, the effects covid-19 have had on its tenants are still heavily considered when evaluating the adequacy of the collectability of the tenant's total accounts receivable balance, including the corresponding straight-line rent receivable. as of december 31, 2021, the company's consolidated accounts receivable balance was 35% potentially uncollectible, including receivables from tenants that are being accounted for on a cash basis, and 11% of the company's straight-line rent receivables were potentially uncollectible, also inclusive of tenants that are being accounted for on a cash basis. these reserves are primarily attributable to the impact from the covid-19 pandemic. management's estimate of the collectability of accrued rents and accounts receivable is based on the best information available to management at the time of evaluation. the company will continue to monitor the economic, financial, and social conditions resulting from the covid-19 pandemic and will continue to assess the collectability of its tenant accounts receivables. as such, the company may determine that further adjustments to its accounts receivable may be required in the future, and such amounts may be material.

the company faces external factors which may influence its future results from operations. the convenience and availability of e-commerce has continued to impact the retail sector, which could affect our ability to increase or maintain rental rates and our ability to renew expiring leases and/or lease available space. to mitigate the effect of e-commerce on its business, the company's strategy has been to attract local area customers to its properties by providing a diverse and robust tenant base across a variety of retailers, including grocery stores, off-price retailers, discounters or service-oriented tenants, which offer buy online and pick up in store, off-price merchandise and day-to-day necessities rather than high-priced luxury items.
the company's portfolio is focused on major metropolitan-area u.s. markets, predominantly on the east and west coasts and in the sun belt region, which are supported by strong demographics, significant projected population growth, and where the company perceives significant barriers to entry.  the company owns a predominantly grocery-anchored portfolio clustered in the nation's top markets which positioned the company to overcome many of the challenges brought upon by covid-19. the company believes it can continue to increase its occupancy levels, rental rates and overall rental growth. in addition, the company, on a selective basis, has developed or redeveloped projects which include residential and mixed-use components.
as part of the company's investment strategy, each property is evaluated for its highest and best use, which may include residential and mixed-use components. in addition, the company may consider other opportunistic investments related to retailer controlled real estate, such as, repositioning underperforming retail locations, retail real estate financing and bankruptcy transaction support. the company may continue to dispose of certain properties. if the estimated fair value for any of these assets is less than their net carrying values, the company would be required to take impairment charges and such amounts could be material. for a further discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future results, performance or transactions, see item 1a. "risk factors."

net income available to the company's common shareholders was $818.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, as compared to $975.4 million for the comparable period in 2020. on a diluted per share basis, net income available to the company's common shareholders for the year ended december 31, 2021, was $1.60 as compared to $2.25 for the comparable period in 2020. for additional disclosure, see footnote 27 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k.
the following describes the changes of certain line items included on the company's consolidated statements of income, that the company believes changed significantly and affected net income available to the company's common shareholders during the year ended december 31, 2021, as compared to the corresponding period in 2020:
revenue from rental properties, net -
the increase in revenues from rental properties, net of $304.8 million is primarily from (i) an increase in revenues of $197.6 million due to properties acquired, primarily resulting from the merger, (ii) a net decrease in credit losses from tenants of $86.8 million primarily due to increased collections, (iii) an increase in net straight-line rental income of $28.5 million primarily due to a decrease in reserves, increase in leasing activity and the merger, and (iv) an increase in lease termination fee income of $9.4 million partially offset by (v) a net decrease in revenues of $17.5 million, primarily due to tenant vacancies and dispositions for the year ended december 31, 2021, as compared to the corresponding period in 2020.
30
real estate taxes -
the increase in real estate taxes of $23.6 million is primarily due to an increase in properties acquired through the merger.
operating and maintenance -
the increase in operating and maintenance expense of $48.8 million is primarily due to (i) an increase in operating expenses of $31.8 million relating to properties acquired through the merger, (ii) an increase in utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance and advertising costs of $11.3 million, primarily due to the reopening of markets throughout the country and (iii) an increase in snow removal costs of $5.7 million.
general and administrative -
the increase in general and administrative expense of $10.9 million is primarily due to (i) an increase in employee-related expenses of $16.2 million primarily related to increased staffing due to the merger and higher performance based compensation bonuses and (ii) an increase of $1.9 million primarily due to the fluctuations in value of various directors' deferred stock, partially offset by (iii) a decrease in severance charges related to employee retirement and terminations of $8.1 million during the year ended december 31, 2021, as compared to the corresponding period in 2020.
impairment charges -
during the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, the company recognized impairment charges of $3.6 million and $6.6 million, respectively, primarily related to adjustments to property carrying values for which the company's estimated fair values were primarily based upon signed contracts or letters of intent from third-party offers. these adjustments to property carrying values were recognized in connection with the company's efforts to market certain properties and management's assessment as to the likelihood and timing of such potential transactions. certain of the calculations to determine fair values utilized unobservable inputs and, as such, were classified as level 3 of the fasb's fair value hierarchy. for additional disclosure, see footnotes 6 and 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k.
merger charges -
during the year ended december 31, 2021, the company incurred costs of $50.2 million associated with the merger. these charges are primarily comprised of severance costs and professional and legal fees.
depreciation and amortization -
the increase in depreciation and amortization of $106.4 million is primarily due to (i) an increase of $108.1 million primarily resulting from property acquisitions in connection with the merger during 2021 and (ii) an increase of $8.3 million due to depreciation commencing on certain development and redevelopment projects that were placed into service during 2021 and 2020, partially offset by (iii) a decrease of $11.8 million due to write-offs of depreciable assets primarily due to tenant vacates and dispositions during 2020 and 2021.
gain on sale of properties -
during 2021, the company disposed of 13 operating properties and 10 parcels (including the deconsolidation of 6 operating properties), in separate transactions, for an aggregate sales price of $612.4 million, which resulted in aggregate gains of $30.8 million. during 2020, the company disposed of three operating properties and four parcels, in separate transactions, for an aggregate sales price of $31.8 million, for which certain of the transactions resulted in aggregate gains of $6.5 million.
other income, net -
the increase in other income, net of $15.7 million is primarily due to (i) an increase in dividend income of $12.9 million primarily from the shares of aci common stock held by the company and (ii) a net increase in mortgage and other financing income of $4.7 million primarily due to new loans issued during 2021 and 2020, (iii) an increase in net periodic benefit income of $3.6 million relating to the company's defined benefit plan, partially offset by (iv) an increase of $2.8 million in costs associated with potential transactions for which the company is no longer pursuing.
gain on marketable securities, net -
the decrease in gain on marketable securities, net of $89.6 million is primarily the result of mark-to-market fluctuations of the shares of aci common stock held by the company, which were obtained during aci's initial public offering ("ipo") in june 2020. the ipo resulted in the company changing the classification of its aci investment from a cost method investment to a marketable security.
31
gain on sale of cost method investment -
in june 2020, the company recognized an aggregate gain of $190.8 million related to (i) a $131.6 million gain resulting from aci's partial repurchase of its common stock from existing shareholders in conjunction with its issuance of convertible preferred stock and (ii) a gain of $59.2 million in connection with the partial sale of the shares of aci common stock held by the company during aci's ipo.
interest expense -
the increase in interest expense of $17.2 million is primarily due to (i) increased levels of borrowings and assumptions of unsecured notes and mortgages in connection with the merger and public debt offerings and (ii) a decrease in capitalized interest due to certain development and redevelopment projects that were placed into service during 2021 and 2020, partially offset by (iii) the repayment of unsecured notes and mortgages during 2021 and 2020.
early extinguishment of debt charges -
during 2020, the company fully redeemed $484.9 million of its outstanding 3.20% senior unsecured notes, which were scheduled to mature in may 2021. as a result, the company incurred a prepayment charge of $7.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2020.
equity in income of joint ventures, net -
the increase in equity in income of joint ventures, net of $37.4 million is primarily due to (i) an increase in equity in income of $18.7 million within various joint venture investments during 2021, as compared to the corresponding period in 2020, primarily resulting from a decrease in credit losses due to collections from tenants, including straight-line rental income, (ii) an increase in net gains of $16.6 million resulting from the sale of properties within various joint venture investments during 2021, as compared to the corresponding period in 2020, and (iii) an increase in equity in income of $3.5 million resulting from ownership interests acquired in unconsolidated joint ventures in connection with the merger, partially offset by (iv) an increase in impairment charges of $1.4 million recognized during 2021, as compared to the corresponding period in 2020.
equity in income of other investments, net -
the decrease in equity in income of other investments, net of $5.5 million is primarily due to a decrease in equity in income and profit participation from the sale of properties within the company's preferred equity program during 2021 and 2020, partially offset by an increase in equity in income from new investments during 2021 and 2020.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests -
the increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $3.6 million is primarily due to (i) an increase in net gain on sale of properties, within consolidated joint ventures, during 2021, as compared to the corresponding period in 2020 and (ii) an increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests recognized in connection with the merger.

covid-19 -
as the covid-19 pandemic continues to evolve, uncertainty remains regarding the long-term economic impact it will have. as a result, the company has focused on creating a strong liquidity position, including, but not limited to, maintaining availability under its credit facility, cash and cash equivalents on hand and having access to unencumbered property interests.
the company continues to monitor the impact of covid-19 on the company's business, tenants and industry as a whole. the magnitude and duration of the covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the company's operations and liquidity remains uncertain as this pandemic continues to evolve globally and within the united states. however, if the covid-19 pandemic continues, such impacts could grow, become material and materially disrupt the company's business operations and materially adversely affect the company's liquidity.

in connection with its intention to continue to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, the company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its stockholders. these dividends will be paid from operating cash flows. the company's board of directors will continue to evaluate the company's dividend policy on a quarterly basis as the board of directors monitors sources of capital and evaluates the impact of the economy and capital markets availability on operating fundamentals. since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investment, the company generally intends to maintain a dividend payout ratio which reserves such amounts as it considers necessary for the expansion and renovation of shopping centers in its portfolio, debt reduction, the acquisition of interests in new properties and other investments as suitable opportunities arise and such other factors as the board of directors considers appropriate. cash dividends paid were $382.1 million, $379.9 million and $531.6 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019 respectively.
although the company receives substantially all of its rental payments on a monthly basis, it generally intends to continue paying dividends quarterly. amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution will be invested by the company in short-term money market or other suitable instruments. the company's board of directors will continue to monitor the impact the covid-19 pandemic has on the company's financial performance and economic outlook. the company's objective is to establish a dividend level that maintains compliance with the company's reit taxable income distribution requirements. on october 26, 2021, the company's board of directors declared quarterly dividends with respect to the company's classes of cumulative redeemable preferred shares (classes l and m), which were paid on january 17, 2022, to shareholders of record on january 3, 2022. additionally, on october 26, 2021, the company's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per common share, which was paid on december 23, 2021 to shareholders of record on december 9, 2021.
on february 1, 2022, the company's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per common share, representing a 11.8% increase from the prior quarterly dividend, payable to shareholders of record on march 10, 2022, which is scheduled to be paid on march 24, 2022. in addition, the company's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend with respect to the company's classes of cumulative redeemable preferred shares (classes l and m) which are scheduled to be paid on april 15, 2022, to shareholders of record on april 1, 2022.

(3)   for leases which have inflationary increases, future ground and office rent expense was calculated using the rent based upon initial lease payment.
the company has $805.1 million of consolidated unsecured debt and $115.9 million of consolidated secured debt scheduled to mature in 2022. the company anticipates satisfying the remaining future maturities with operating cash flows, its credit facility or public debt offerings, if needed.
the company has issued letters of credit in connection with the completion and repayment guarantees, primarily on certain of the company's redevelopment projects and guaranty of payment related to the company's insurance program. at december 31, 2021, these letters of credit aggregated $44.5 million.
in connection with the construction of its development/redevelopment projects and related infrastructure, certain public agencies require posting of performance and surety bonds to guarantee that the company's obligations are satisfied. these bonds expire upon the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. as of december 31, 2021, the company had $12.7 million in performance and surety bonds outstanding.
the company has two investments that have investment funding commitments totaling $27.0 million, of which $4.3 million has been funded as of december 31, 2021.  the company's remaining commitment to fund related to these investments is $22.7 million in total as of december 31, 2021.
in connection with the merger, the company now provides a guaranty for the payment of any debt service shortfalls on series a bonds issued by the sheridan redevelopment agency which are tax increment revenue bonds issued in connection with a property owned by the company in sheridan, colorado. these tax increment revenue bonds have a balance of $49.7 million outstanding at december 31, 2021. the bonds are to be repaid with incremental sales and property taxes and a public improvement fee ("pif") to be assessed on current and future retail sales and, to the extent necessary, any amounts we may have to provide under a guaranty. the revenue generated from incremental sales, property taxes and pif have satisfied the debt service requirements to date. the incremental taxes and pif are to remain intact until the earlier of the payment of the bond liability in full or 2040.
off-balance sheet arrangements unconsolidated real estate joint ventures the company has investments in various unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with varying structures. these joint ventures primarily operate shopping center properties. the properties owned by the joint ventures are primarily financed with individual non-recourse mortgage loans, however, the company, on a selective basis, has obtained unsecured financing for certain joint ventures. as of december 31, 2021, the company did not guarantee any joint venture unsecured debt. non-recourse mortgage debt is generally defined as debt whereby the lenders' sole recourse with respect to borrower defaults is limited to the value of the property collateralized by the mortgage. the lender generally does not have recourse against any other assets owned by the borrower or any of the constituent members of the borrower, except for certain specified exceptions listed in the particular loan documents (see footnote 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k).
debt balances within the company's unconsolidated joint venture investments for which the company held noncontrolling ownership interests at december 31, 2021, aggregated $1.6 billion. as of december 31, 2021, these loans had scheduled maturities ranging from four months to 9.5 years and bore interest at rates ranging from 1.30% to 6.38%. approximately $109.3 million of the aggregate outstanding loan balance matures in 2022. these maturing loans are anticipated to be repaid with operating cash flows, debt refinancing, unsecured credit facilities, proceeds from sales of the respective entities, and partner capital contributions, as deemed appropriate (see footnote 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k).
other investments the company has provided capital to owners and developers of real estate properties and loans through its preferred equity program. as of december 31, 2021, the company's net investment under the preferred equity program was $98.7 million relating to 39 properties, including 28 net leased properties, which are accounted for as direct financing leases. as of december 31, 2021, these preferred equity investment properties had non-recourse mortgage loans aggregating $237.4 million. these loans have scheduled maturities ranging from two months to 2.5 years and bear interest at rates ranging from 4.19% to 8.88%. due to the company's preferred position in these investments, the company's share of each investment is subject to fluctuation and is dependent upon property cash flows. the company's maximum exposure to losses associated with its preferred equity investments is limited to its invested capital.

funds from operations ffo is a supplemental non-gaap financial measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies. nareit defines ffo as net income/(loss) available to the company's common shareholders computed in accordance with gaap, excluding (i) depreciation and amortization related to real estate, (ii) gains or losses from sales of certain real estate assets, (iii) gains and losses from change in control, (iv) impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and (v) after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis. the company also made an election, per the nareit funds from operations white paper-2018 restatement, to exclude from its calculation of ffo (i) gains and losses on the sale of assets and impairments of assets incidental to its main business and (ii) mark-to-market changes in the value of its equity securities. as such, the company does not include gains/impairments on land parcels, gains/losses (realized or unrealized) from marketable securities, allowance for credit losses on mortgage receivables or gains/impairments on preferred equity participations in nareit defined ffo.
the company presents ffo available to the company's common shareholders as it considers it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits, many of which present ffo available to the company's common shareholders when reporting results. comparison of our presentation of ffo available to the company's common shareholders to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits.
ffo is a supplemental non-gaap financial measure of real estate companies' operating performances, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and, therefore, should not be considered an alternative for net income or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity.

(2)   reflects the potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period, which would have a dilutive effect on ffo available to the company's common shareholders. ffo available to the company's common shareholders would be increased by $856 and $92 for the three months ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $1,053 and $309 for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. the effect of other certain convertible units would have an anti-dilutive effect upon the calculation of ffo available to the company's common shareholders per share. accordingly, the impact of such conversion has not been included in the determination of diluted earnings per share calculations.
(3)   includes merger charges of $50.2 million recognized during the year ended december 31, 2021, in connection with the merger. in addition the three months and year ended december 31, 2021, includes a pension valuation adjustment of $3.0 million of income included in other income, net on the company's consolidated statement of income.
same property net operating income same property noi is a supplemental non-gaap financial measure of real estate companies' operating performance and should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with gaap or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. the company considers same property noi as an important operating performance measure because it is frequently used by securities analysts and investors to measure only the net operating income of properties that have been owned by the company for the entire current and prior year reporting periods. it excludes properties under redevelopment, development and pending stabilization; properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of (i) reaching 90% leased or (ii) one year following a project's inclusion in operating real estate. same property noi assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the company's properties.

for the three months ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, the company included same property noi from the weingarten properties acquired through the merger, as the company owned these properties for the full three months ended december 31, 2021. the amount of the adjustment relating to weingarten same property noi for the three months ended december 31, 2020, included in the table below, represents the same property noi from weingarten properties prior to the merger, which is not included in the company's net income available to the company's common shareholders.  same property noi from properties acquired through the merger was excluded for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, as the company did not own these properties for the full year ended december 31, 2021.
same property noi is calculated using revenues from rental properties (excluding straight-line rent adjustments, lease termination fees, tifs and amortization of above/below-market rents) less charges for bad debt, operating and maintenance expense, real estate taxes and rent expense plus the company's proportionate share of same property noi from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, calculated on the same basis. the company's method of calculating same property noi available to the company's common shareholders may differ from methods used by other reits and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other reits.

(1)   same property noi from properties acquired through the merger are included in the three months ended december 31, 2021 and 2020 but excluded for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020.

(2)   amounts for the three months ended december 31, 2020, represent the same property nois from weingarten properties, not included in the company's net income available to the company's common shareholders.

same property noi increased by $35.7 million, or 12.9%, for the three months ended december 31, 2021, as compared to the corresponding period in 2020. this increase is primarily the result of (i) a decrease in credit losses of $15.7 million due to increased collections, (ii) an increase in revenues from rental properties of $11.4 million primarily related to a decrease in tenant rent abatements and vacancies as a result of the covid-19 pandemic during 2020, as compared to 2021, and (iii) an increase of $8.6 million from properties acquired through the merger.
same property noi increased by $69.6 million, or 8.8%, for the year ended december 31, 2021, as compared to the corresponding period in 2020. this increase is primarily the result of (i) a decrease in credit losses of $92.3 million due to increased collections, partially offset by (ii) a decrease in revenues from rental properties of $18.8 million primarily related to a decrease in tenant rent abatements and vacancies as a result of the covid-19 pandemic and (iii) an increase in non-recoverable operating expenses of $3.9 million.
effects of inflation many of the company's long-term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants' gross sales above pre-determined thresholds, which generally increase as prices rise, and/or as a result of escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices. in addition, many of the company's leases are for terms of less than 10 years, which permits the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal. most of the company's leases include escalation clauses or require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, thereby reducing the company's exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.

medicaid medicaid premium revenue increased $6.2 billion in 2021, when compared with 2020, mainly due to the impact from the magellan complete care, and other acquisitions closed in the second half of 2020, the affinity acquisition that closed in the fourth quarter of 2021, and organic membership growth. excluding acquisitions, membership growth occurred across nearly all our states and was mainly driven by the extension of the phe period and the associated suspension of membership redeterminations. also contributing to the overall premium revenue increase was a lower impact of covid-related risk corridors in 2021 compared to 2020.

to the lower utilization of medical services resulting from covid-19. we recognized $564 million related to covid-related risk corridors in 2020, mainly related to medicaid.
the medical margin of our medicaid program increased $518 million, or 29%, in 2021 when compared with 2020. the increase was driven by increased premium revenues and margin associated with the membership growth discussed above, partially offset by the mcr increase discussed below.
the medicaid mcr increased to 88.7% in 2021, from 87.4% in 2020, or 130 basis points. the increase in the medicaid mcr in 2021 was mainly due to business mix changes, partially offset by continued medical cost management and a year-over-year decrease in the net effect of covid. the year-over-year change in impact of the net effect of covid reflects the decrease in covid-related risk corridors discussed above, partially offset by an increase in covid-related inpatient costs, and lower covid-related utilization curtailment. the medicaid mcr is consistent with our long-term target despite the net effect of covid.
medicare medicare premium revenue increased $849 million in 2021, when compared with 2020, primarily due to the impact of higher membership, mainly from the magellan complete care acquisition, and higher premium revenue pmpm.
the medical margin for medicare increased $79 million, or 23%, in 2021 when compared with 2020. the year-over-year increase in margin is driven by the increase in premium revenue from higher volume, partially offset by the mcr increase discussed below.
the medicare mcr increased to 87.2% in 2021, from 86.0% in 2020, or 120 basis points. the increase was primarily driven by the net effect of covid, including higher direct covid medical costs, resulting from higher infection rates in our medicare population. the net effect of covid had a negligible impact on the mcr in 2020. the medicare mcr is in line with our long-term target despite the net effect of covid.
marketplace marketplace premium revenue increased $1.5 billion in 2021, when compared with 2020, mainly due to higher membership, partially offset by a decrease in premium revenue pmpm. our marketplace membership as of december 31, 2021, amounted to 728,000 members, representing growth of 410,000 members year over year, and substantially exceeding our expectations. this improvement resulted from several factors, including strong product design and competitive pricing, better than expected natural attrition rates, and the extended special enrollment period. the decrease in premium revenue pmpm was mainly driven by changes in business mix, with an increase of members in the bronze metal tier.
the marketplace medical margin increased $75 million in 2021, primarily due to the increase in membership and premiums, mostly offset by an increase in the mcr compared to 2020.
the marketplace mcr increased to 86.9% in 2021, compared to 78.7% in 2020, or 820 basis points. the increase in mcr resulted mainly from a higher net effect of covid, due to continued covid utilization pressure in our largest marketplace geographies, and increased non-covid medical costs by members enrolled through the special enrollment period. special enrollment period membership grew to almost 40% of our marketplace book by the fourth quarter, and many of the new members that we attracted in 2021 were in regions disproportionately affected by covid, particularly in texas. moreover, we attracted a large number of members through the special enrollment period, and those members experienced higher non-covid utilization in addition to covid-related costs.
other the other segment includes service revenues and costs associated with the long-term services and supports consultative services we now provide in wisconsin as a result of our magellan complete care acquisition, and also includes certain corporate amounts not allocated to the medicaid, medicare, or marketplace segments. such amounts were immaterial to our consolidated results of operations for 2021 and 2020.
liquidity and financial condition liquidity we manage our cash, investments, and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. we forecast, analyze, and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy.

we maintain liquidity at two levels: 1) the regulated health plan subsidiaries; and 2) the parent company.
our regulated health plan subsidiaries' primary liquidity requirements include payment of medical claims and other health care services; payment of certain settlements with our state and federal customers, such as mlr and risk corridors and marketplace risk transfers on behalf of cms; general and administrative costs directly incurred or paid through an administrative services agreement to the parent company; and federal tax payments to the parent company under an intercompany tax sharing agreement. our regulated health plan subsidiaries meet their liquidity needs by generating cash flows from operating activities, primarily from premium revenue; cash flows from investing activities, including investment income and sales of investments; and capital contributions received from our parent company.
our regulated health plan subsidiaries generally receive premiums in advance of payments of claims for medical and other health care services; however, cash and cash equivalents in regulated health plan subsidiaries can fluctuate significantly in a particular period depending on the timing of receipts for premiums from our government partners. any decline or delay in receipt of premium revenue could have a negative impact on our liquidity. we did not experience noticeable delays to, or changes in, the timing or level of premium receipts in 2021 as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, but there can be no assurance that we will not experience such delays in the future. see further discussion below in "future sources and uses of liquidity-future uses-potential impact of covid-19 pandemic."
our regulated health plan subsidiaries are each subject to applicable state regulations that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of capital and surplus. we continue to maintain appropriate levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our regulated health plan subsidiaries. see further discussion under "regulatory capital and dividend restrictions" below. when available and as permitted by applicable regulations, cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plan subsidiaries is generally paid in the form of dividends to our parent company to be used for general corporate purposes. the regulated health plan subsidiaries paid dividends to the parent company amounting to $564 million in 2021 and $635 million in 2020.
parent company liquidity requirements generally consist of payment of administrative costs not directly incurred by our regulated operations, including, but not limited to, staffing costs, lease payments, branding and certain information technology services; capital contributions paid to our regulated health plan subsidiaries, including funding for newer health plans; capital expenditures; debt service; funding for common stock purchases, acquisitions and other growth-related activities; and federal tax payments. the parent company contributed capital of $440 million and $107 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, to our regulated health plan subsidiaries to satisfy statutory capital and surplus requirements. the increased contributions in 2021 were mainly attributed to fund growth in our new york and kentucky health plans. our parent company normally meets its liquidity requirements by earning administrative services fees under administrative services agreements; dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries; collecting federal tax payments from the regulated subsidiaries; proceeds from issuance of debt and equity securities; and cash flows from investing activities, including investment income and sales of investments.
cash, cash equivalents and investments at the parent company amounted to $348 million and $644 million as of december 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. the decrease in 2021 was due to cash used for acquisitions and share repurchases, partially offset by dividends received from regulated health plan subsidiaries. in the first quarter of 2021, we purchased an aggregate of approximately 577,000 shares for $122 million, and we also paid $6 million to settle shares purchased in late december 2020.
investments after considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short-term obligations in longer term, investment-grade, and marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. these investments are made pursuant to board-approved investment policies which conform to applicable state laws and regulations.
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity, preserve capital, and maximize total return on invested assets, all in a manner consistent with state requirements that prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest. these investment policies require that our investments have final maturities of less than 10 years, or less than 10 years average life for structured securities. professional portfolio managers operating under documented guidelines manage our investments and a portion of our cash equivalents. our portfolio managers must obtain our prior approval before selling investments where the loss position of those investments exceeds certain levels.

we believe that the risks of the covid-19 pandemic, as they relate to our investments, are minimal. the overall rating of our portfolio is aa. our investment policy has directives in conjunction with state guidelines to minimize risks and exposures in volatile markets. additionally, our portfolio managers assist us in navigating the current volatility in the capital markets.
our restricted investments are invested principally in cash, cash equivalents, and u.s. treasury securities; we have the ability to hold such restricted investments until maturity. all of our unrestricted investments are classified as current assets.
cash flow activities our cash flows are summarized as follows:

operating activities we typically receive capitation payments monthly, in advance of payments for medical claims; however, government payors may adjust their payment schedules, positively or negatively impacting our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period. for example, government payors may delay our premium payments, or they may prepay the following month's premium payment.
net cash provided by operations was $2.1 billion in 2021, compared with $1.9 billion of net cash provided in 2020. the $221 million increase in cash flow was due to the growth in operations and the net impact of timing differences in government receivables and payables.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $1.7 billion in 2021, compared with $400 million of net cash used in 2020, a decrease in year-over-year cash flow of $1.3 billion. this change in cash flow was primarily due to increased purchases of investments in 2021, after a temporarily higher allocation in shorter-term invested assets during the covid-19 pandemic was rescinded in the second quarter of 2021.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was $183 million in 2021, compared with $217 million of net cash provided by 2020, a decrease in year-over-year cash flow of $400 million. in 2021, cash inflows included $740 million from the issuance of the 3.875% notes due 2032, and cash outflows included $723 million in repayment of the 5.375% notes due 2022, common stock purchases of $128 million and $53 million for common stock withheld to settle employee tax obligations. additionally, we paid $23 million to settle contingent consideration liabilities relating to our kentucky passport acquisition that closed in 2020, $20 million of which has been presented as a financing cash outflow. in the year ended december 31, 2020, financing cash inflows included $1,429 million from the issuance of the 4.375% notes due 2028 and 3.875% notes due 2030 and $380 million borrowed under the term loan facility. cash outflows included the $600 million repayment of the term loan facility, common stock purchases of $606 million, which included $7 million to settle shares purchased in late december 2019, and net cash paid for the senior notes-related transactions amounting to $380 million.
financial condition we believe that our cash resources, borrowing capacity available under our credit agreement as discussed further below in "future sources and uses of liquidity-future sources," and internally generated funds will be sufficient to support our operations, regulatory requirements, debt repayment obligations and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.
on a consolidated basis, as of december 31, 2021, our working capital was $3.0 billion compared with $2.9 billion as of december 31, 2020. at december 31, 2021, our cash and investments amounted to $7.9 billion, compared with $6.2 billion of cash and investments at december 31, 2020.

because of the statutory restrictions that inhibit the ability of our health plan subsidiaries to transfer net assets to us, the amount of retained earnings readily available to pay dividends to our stockholders is generally limited to cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our unregulated parent. for more information, see the "liquidity" discussion presented above.
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions each of our regulated, wholly owned subsidiaries must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital determined by statute or regulations. such statutes, regulations and capital requirements also restrict the timing, payment and amount of dividends and other distributions, loans or advances that may be paid to us as the sole stockholder. to the extent our subsidiaries must comply with these regulations, they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us. based upon current statutes and regulations, the minimum capital and surplus requirement for these subsidiaries was estimated to be approximately $2.1 billion at december 31, 2021, compared with $1.5 billion at december 31, 2020. the aggregate capital and surplus of our wholly owned subsidiaries was in excess of these minimum capital requirements as of both dates.
under applicable regulatory requirements, the amount of dividends that may be paid by our wholly owned subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities as of december 31, 2021, was approximately $197 million in the aggregate. the subsidiaries may pay dividends over this amount, but only after approval is granted by the regulatory authorities.
based on our cash and investments balances as of december 31, 2021, management believes that our regulated wholly owned subsidiaries remain well capitalized and exceed their regulatory minimum requirements. we have the ability, and have committed to provide, additional capital to each of our health plans as necessary to ensure compliance with statutory capital and surplus requirements.
capital structure in september 2021, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $500 million, in the aggregate, of our common stock. this new program immediately supersedes the stock purchase program previously approved by our board of directors in september 2020. this new program will be funded with cash on hand and extends through december 31, 2022.
as debt held by the parent company comes due, we typically engage in a new private offering of debt to retire and replace the prior issuance. over the last several years we have seen a continued decline in interest rates, which has benefited our overall cost of capital during that time. there is no guarantee that the interest rate environment will continue to see declines in interest rates in the future, and future refinancing may occur at a higher rate than those we have achieved historically. this could increase our cost of capital in the future or cause us to pursue alternative financing sources, should the need arise.
we are not a party to any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
debt ratings each of our senior notes is rated "bb-" by standard & poor's, and "ba3" by moody's investor service, inc. a downgrade in our ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and increase our borrowing costs.
financial covenants the credit agreement contains customary non-financial and financial covenants, including a net leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. such ratios are computed as defined by the terms of the credit agreement.
in addition, the indentures governing each of our outstanding senior notes contain cross-default provisions that are triggered upon default by us or any of our subsidiaries on any indebtedness in excess of the amount specified in the applicable indenture. as of december 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants under the credit agreement and other long-term debt.
future sources and uses of liquidity future sources our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from premium revenue, which is generally received a short time before related healthcare services are paid. premium revenue is our primary source of liquidity. thus, any decline in the receipt of premium revenue, and our profitability, could have a negative impact on our liquidity.

potential impact of covid-19 pandemic. excluding acquisitions and our exit from puerto rico, we have added approximately 750,000 new medicaid members since march 31, 2020, when we first began to report on the impacts of the pandemic. we believe this membership increase was mainly due to the suspension of redeterminations for medicaid eligibility. we expect medicaid enrollment to continue to benefit from the extension of the phe period, and the associated pause on membership redeterminations, at least through mid-april 2022.
dividends from subsidiaries. when available and as permitted by applicable regulations, cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plans is generally paid in the form of dividends to our unregulated parent company to be used for general corporate purposes. as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, state regulators could restrict the ability of our regulated health plan subsidiaries to pay dividends to the parent company, which could reduce the liquidity of the parent company. for more information on our regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions, refer to notes to consolidated financial statements, note 15, "commitments and contingencies-regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions," and note 17, "condensed financial information of registrant-note c - dividends and capital contributions."
credit agreement borrowing capacity. as of december 31, 2021, we had available borrowing capacity of $1 billion under the revolving credit facility of our credit agreement. in addition, the credit agreement provides for a $15 million swingline sub-facility and a $100 million letter of credit sub-facility, as well as incremental term loans available to finance certain acquisitions up to $500 million, plus an unlimited amount of such term loans as long as we maintain a minimum consolidated net leverage ratio. see further discussion in the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 11, "debt."
future uses common stock purchases. in september 2021, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $500 million, in the aggregate, of our common stock. this new program immediately supersedes the stock purchase program previously approved by our board of directors in september 2020. this new program will be funded with cash on hand and extends through december 31, 2022. the exact timing and amount of any repurchase is determined by management based on market conditions and share price, in addition to other factors, and subject to the restrictions relating to volume, price, and timing under applicable law. as of february 14, 2022, $500 million remained available to purchase our common stock under this program through december 31, 2022. see further information in the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 13, "stockholders' equity."
acquisitions. we have a disciplined and steady approach to growth. organic growth, which includes leveraging our existing health plan portfolio and winning new territories, is our highest priority. in addition to organic growth, we will consider targeted acquisitions that are a strategic fit that we believe will leverage operational synergies, and lead to incremental earnings accretion. for further information on our acquisitions, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 4, "business combinations."
on october 7, 2021, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire the medicaid managed long term care business of agewell new york. as of august 31, 2021, agewell served approximately 13,000 managed long-term services and supports members, with full-year 2020 premium revenue of approximately $700 million. the purchase price for the transaction is approximately $106 million, net of certain tax benefits and target allocation of required regulatory capital, which we intend to fund with cash on hand. the transaction is subject to applicable federal and state regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. we currently expect the transaction to close by the third quarter of 2022.
potential impact of covid-19 pandemic. as described in "item 1. business-covid-19 pandemic," we have been subject to medicaid risk corridors as a result of the pandemic. beginning in 2020, through december 31, 2021, various states enacted temporary risk corridors in response to the reduced demand for medical services stemming from covid-19, which have resulted in a reduction of our medical margin, primarily in the medicaid segment. in some cases, these risk corridors were retroactive to earlier periods in 2020, or as early as the beginning of the states' fiscal years in 2019. beginning in the second quarter of 2020, we have recognized retroactive risk corridors that we believe to be probable, and where the ultimate premium amount is reasonably estimable. we recognized approximately $323 million, in the aggregate, related to such risk corridors, in 2021, and approximately $564 million, in the aggregate, was recognized in 2020.
it is possible that certain states could change the structure of existing risk corridors, implement new risk corridors in the future or discontinue existing risk corridors. due to these uncertainties, the ultimate outcomes could differ materially from our estimates as a result of changes in facts or further developments, which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions. we have the ability, and have committed to provide, additional capital to each of our health plans as necessary to ensure compliance with minimum statutory capital requirements.
the molina healthcare charitable foundation. in august 2020, we announced our commitment of $150 million to fund the molina healthcare charitable foundation (the "foundation"), an independent not-for-profit charitable foundation. we contributed $15 million to the foundation in the fourth quarter of 2020.
contractual obligations. we are party to various contractual obligations that we will be required to satisfy over the short and long term. the majority are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements and primarily include the following: medical claims and benefits payable, amounts due to government agencies, principal and interest on our debt and leases. some items are based on management's estimates and assumptions about obligations, including duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties, and other factors. because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary. additionally, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring services used in our operations. however, we believe these other agreements do not contain material non-cancelable commitments.
critical accounting estimates when we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we use estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. actual results could differ from these estimates, and some differences could be material. our most significant accounting estimates, which include a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity, include the following:
•medical claims and benefits payable. see discussion below, and refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, notes 2, "significant accounting policies," and 10, "medical claims and benefits payable" for more information.
•contractual provisions that may adjust or limit revenue or profit. for a discussion of this topic, including amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies."
•quality incentives. for a discussion of this topic, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies."
•business combinations, and goodwill and intangible assets, net. for a comprehensive discussion of this topic, including amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies," note 4, "business combinations," and note 9, "goodwill and intangible assets, net."
medical care costs, medical claims and benefits payable medical care costs are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include fee-for-service claims, pharmacy benefits, capitation payments to providers, and various other medically-related costs. under fee-for-service claims arrangements with providers, we retain the financial responsibility for medical care provided and incur costs based on actual utilization of hospital and physician services. such medical care costs include amounts paid by us as well as estimated medical claims and benefits payable for costs that were incurred but not paid as of the reporting date ("ibnp"). pharmacy benefits represent payments for members' prescription drug costs, net of rebates from drug manufacturers. we estimate pharmacy rebates based on historical and current utilization of prescription drugs and contractual provisions. capitation payments represent monthly contractual fees paid to providers, who are responsible for providing medical care to members, which could include medical or ancillary costs like dental, vision and other supplemental health benefits. such capitation costs are fixed in advance of the periods covered and are not subject to significant accounting estimates. other medical care costs include all medically-related administrative costs, amounts due to providers pursuant to risk-sharing or other incentive arrangements, provider claims, and other healthcare expenses. examples of medically-related administrative costs include expenses relating to health education, quality assurance, case management, care coordination, disease management, and 24-hour on-call nurses. additionally, we include an estimate for the cost of settling claims incurred through the reporting date in our medical claims and benefits payable liability.

the following table illustrates consolidated medical care costs by type for the periods indicated:

medical claims and benefits payable consist mainly of fee-for-service ibnp, unpaid pharmacy claims, capitation costs, other medical costs, including amounts payable to providers pursuant to risk-sharing or other incentive arrangements and amounts payable to providers on behalf of certain state agencies for certain state assessments in which we assume no financial risk. ibnp includes the costs of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date which have been reported to us, and our best estimate of the cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us. we also include an additional reserve to ensure that our overall ibnp liability is sufficient under moderately adverse conditions. we reflect changes in these estimates in the consolidated results of operations in the period in which they are determined.
the estimation of the ibnp liability requires a significant degree of judgment in applying actuarial methods, determining the appropriate assumptions and considering numerous factors. of those factors, we consider estimated completion factors (measures the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will ultimately be paid for a given month of service based on historical payment patterns) and the assumed healthcare cost trend (the year-over-year change in per-member per-month medical care costs) to be the most critical assumptions. other relevant factors also include, but are not limited to, healthcare service utilization trends, claim inventory levels, changes in membership, product mix, seasonality, benefit changes or changes in fee schedules, provider contract changes, prior authorizations and the incidence of catastrophic or pandemic cases.
for claims incurred more than three months before the financial statement date, we mainly use estimated completion factors to estimate the ultimate cost of those claims. completion factors measure the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will ultimately be paid for a given month of service based on historical claims payment patterns. we analyze historical claims payment patterns by comparing claim incurred dates to claim payment dates to estimate completion factors. the estimated completion factors are then applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claims cost for a given month's incurred claim activity. the difference between the estimated ultimate claims cost and the claims paid through the financial statement date represents our estimate of claims remaining to be paid as of the financial statement date and is included in our ibnp liability.
for claims incurred within three months before the financial statement date, actual claims paid are a less reliable measure of our ultimate cost since a large portion of medical claims are not submitted to us until several months after services have been submitted. accordingly, we estimate our ibnp liability for claims incurred during these months based on a blend of estimated completion factors and assumed medical care cost trend. the assumed medical care cost trend represents the year-over-year change in per-member per-month medical care costs, which can be affected by many factors including, but not limited to, our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, changes in member demographics, catastrophes and epidemics, and other relevant factors.
actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that our overall best estimate of the ibnp liability has a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient, where the liability is sufficient to account for moderately adverse conditions. adverse conditions are situations that may cause actual claims to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate, such as changes in the magnitude or severity of claims, uncertainties related to our entry into new geographical markets or provision of services to new populations, changes in state-controlled fee schedules, and modifications or upgrades to our claims processing systems and practices. therefore, in many situations, the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice.

when subsequent actual claims payments are less than we estimated, we recognize a benefit for favorable prior period development that is reported as part of "components of medical care costs related to: "prior years" in the table presented in note 10, "medical claims and benefits payable." our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate including a provision for moderately adverse conditions for each current period. this provision is reported as part of "components of medical care costs related to: current year" in the table presented in note 10. assuming stability in the size of our membership, the use of this consistent methodology, during any given period, usually results in the replenishment of reserves at a level that generally offsets the benefit of favorable prior period development in that period. in the case of material growth or decline of membership, replenishment can exceed or fall short of the favorable development, assuming all other factors remain unchanged.
because of the significant degree of judgment involved in estimation of our ibnp liability, there is considerable variability and uncertainty inherent in such estimates. the following table reflects the hypothetical change in our estimate of claims liability as of december 31, 2021 that would result if we change our completion factors for the fourth through the twelfth months preceding december 31, 2021, by the percentages indicated. a reduction in the completion factor results in an increase in medical claims liabilities. dollar amounts are in millions.

there are many related factors working in conjunction with one another that determine the accuracy of our estimates, some of which are qualitative in nature rather than quantitative. therefore, we are seldom able to quantify the impact that any single factor has on a change in estimate. given the variability inherent in the reserving process, we will only be able to identify specific factors if they represent a significant departure from expectations. as a result, we do not expect to be able to fully quantify the impact of individual factors on changes in estimates.

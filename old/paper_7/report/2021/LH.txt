index critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. while the company believes these estimates are reasonable and consistent, they are by their very nature estimates of amounts that will depend on future events. accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates. the company's audit committee periodically reviews the company's significant accounting policies. the company's critical accounting policies arise in conjunction with the following:
•revenue recognition;
•business combinations;
•income taxes; and
•goodwill and indefinite-lived assets.
revenue recognition dx within the dx segment, a revenue transaction is initiated when dx receives a requisition order to perform a diagnostic test. the information provided on the requisition form is used to determine the party that will be billed for the testing performed and the expected reimbursement. dx recognizes revenue and satisfies its performance obligation for services rendered when the testing process is complete and the associated results are reported. revenues are distributed among four payer portfolios - clients, patients, medicare and medicaid and third party. dx considers negotiated discounts and anticipated adjustments, including historical collection experience for the payer portfolio, when revenues are recorded.
the following are descriptions of the dx payer portfolios:
clients client payers represent the portion of dx's revenue related to physicians, hospitals, health systems, accountable care organizations (acos), employers and other entities where payment is received exclusively from the entity ordering the testing service. generally, client revenues are recorded on a fee-for-service basis at dx's client list price, less any negotiated discount. a portion of client billing is for laboratory management services, collection kits and other non-testing services or products. in these cases, revenue is recognized when services are rendered or delivered.
patients this portfolio includes revenue from uninsured patients and member cost-share for insured patients (e.g., coinsurance, deductibles and non-covered services). uninsured patients are billed based upon dx's patient fee schedules, net of any discounts negotiated with physicians on behalf of their patients. dx bills insured patients as directed by their health plan and after consideration of the fees and terms associated with an established health plan contract.
medicare and medicaid this portfolio relates to fee-for-service revenue from traditional medicare and medicaid programs. net revenue from these programs is based on the fee schedule established by the related government authority. in addition to contractual discounts, other adjustments including anticipated payer denials are considered when determining net revenue. any remaining adjustments to revenue are recorded at the time of final collection and settlement. these adjustments are not material to dx's results of operations in any period presented.
third party third party includes revenue related to mcos. the majority of dx's third-party revenue is reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis. these payers are billed at dx's established list price and revenue is recorded net of contractual discounts. the majority of dx's mco revenues are recorded based upon contractually negotiated fee schedules with revenues for non-contracted mcos recorded based on historical reimbursement experience.
third-party reimbursement is also received through capitation agreements with mcos and independent physician associations (ipas). under capitated agreements, revenue is recognized based on a negotiated per-member, per-month payment for an agreed upon menu of tests, or based upon the proportionate share earned by dx from a capitation pool. when the agreed upon reimbursement is based solely on an established rate per member, revenue is not impacted by the volume of testing performed. under a capitation pool arrangement, the aggregate value of an established rate per member is distributed based on index the volume and complexity of the procedures performed by laboratories participating in the agreement. dx recognizes revenue monthly, based upon the established capitation rate or anticipated distribution from a capitated pool.
dx has a formal process to estimate implicit price concessions for uncollectable accounts. the majority of dx's collection risk is related to accounts receivable from both insured and uninsured patients who are unwilling or unable to pay. anticipated write-offs are recorded as adjustments to revenue at an amount considered necessary to record the segment's revenue at its net realizable value. in addition to contractual discounts, other adjustments including anticipated payer denials and other external factors that could affect the collectability of its receivables are considered when determining revenue and the net receivable amount. any remaining adjustments to revenue are recorded at the time of final collection and settlement. these adjustments are not material to dx's results of operations in any period presented.
dd the nature of dd's obligations includes agreements to provide preclinical services, to manage a full clinical trial, provide services for a specific phase of a trial, or provide research products to the customer. dd provides these services predominantly to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies worldwide. a majority of dd's revenues are earned under contracts that range in duration from a few months to many years. these contracts generally take the form of fee-for-service or fixed-price arrangements subject to pricing adjustments based on changes in scope. the total contract value is estimated at the beginning of the contract, and is equal to the amount expected to be billed to the customer. other payments and billing adjustments may also factor into the calculation of total contract value, such as the reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs and volume-based rebates.
the majority of dd's contracts contain a single performance obligation. for contracts that include multiple performance obligations, dd allocates the contract value to the goods and services based on a customer price list, if available. if a price list is not available, dd will estimate the transaction price using either market prices or an "expected cost plus margin" approach.
fee-for-service contracts are typically priced based on transaction volume or time and materials. for volume based contracts the contract value is entirely variable and revenue is recognized as the specific product or service is completed. for services billed based on time and materials, revenue is recognized using the right to invoice practical expedient.
fixed-price contracts are typically recognized as revenue over time based on a proportional-performance basis, using either input or output methods that are specific to the service provided. in an output method, revenue is determined by dividing the actual units of output achieved by the total units of output required under the contract and multiplying that percentage by the total contract value. when using an input method, revenue is recognized by dividing the actual units of input incurred by the total units of input budgeted in the contract, and multiplying that percentage by the total contract value. the estimate of total units of input at completion requires significant judgment and estimates are based on various assumptions of events that often span several years. these estimates are reviewed periodically and any adjustments are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period they become known.
contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements. generally, when contract modifications create new performance obligations, the modification is considered to be a separate contract and revenue is recognized prospectively. when contract modifications change existing performance obligations, the impact on the existing transaction price and measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates is generally recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue) on a cumulative catch-up basis.
most contracts are terminable with or without cause by the customer, either immediately or upon notice. these contracts often require payment to dd of expenses to wind-down the study or project, fees earned to date and, in some cases, a termination fee or a payment to dd of some portion of the fees or profits that could have been earned by dd under the contract if it had not been terminated early. termination fees are included in revenues when services are performed and realization is assured.
business combinations the company accounts for business combination transactions under the acquisition method of accounting and reported the results of operations of the acquired entities from its respective date of acquisition. assets acquired were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. estimated fair values were based on various valuation methodologies, including an income approach using primarily discounted cash flow techniques for the customer relationships intangible assets. the aforementioned income methods utilize management's estimates of future operating results and cash flows discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects market participant assumptions. the excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed over the fair value of the assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. the goodwill reflects management's expectations of the ability to gain access to and penetrate the acquired entities' historical patient base and the benefits of being able to leverage operational efficiencies with favorable growth opportunities based on positive demographic trends in the market.
index income taxes the company accounts for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax loss carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. the company does not recognize a tax benefit, unless the company concludes that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. if the recognition threshold is met, the company recognizes a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that the company believes is greater than 50% likely to be realized. the company records interest and penalties in income tax expense.
goodwill and indefinite-lived assets the company assesses goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. the annual impairment test for goodwill includes an option to perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value. reporting units are businesses with discrete financial information that is available and reviewed by management. if the company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the company performs the quantitative goodwill impairment test. the company may also choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in its goodwill assessment and proceed directly to performing the quantitative assessment. the company recognizes an impairment charge for the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
in the qualitative assessment, the company considers relevant events and circumstances for each reporting unit, including (i) current year results, (ii) financial performance versus management's annual and five-year strategic plans, (iii) changes in the reporting unit carrying value since prior year, (iv) industry and market conditions in which the reporting unit operates, (v) macroeconomic conditions, including discount rate changes, and (vi) changes in products or services offered by the reporting unit. if applicable, performance in recent years is compared to forecasts included in prior quantitative valuations. based on the results of the qualitative assessment, if the company concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying values of the reporting unit, then no quantitative assessment is performed.
the quantitative assessment includes the estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit as compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. the company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using both income-based and market-based valuation methods. the income-based approach is based on the reporting unit's forecasted future cash flows that are discounted to the present value using the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital. for the market-based approach, the company utilizes a number of factors such as publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of the company as well as operating results, business plans, market multiples, and present value techniques. based upon the range of estimated values developed from the income and market-based methods, the company determines the estimated fair value for the reporting unit. if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required.
the income-based fair value methodology requires management's assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which the company operates and conditions in the capital markets, many of which are outside of management's control. at the reporting unit level, fair value estimation requires management's assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific reporting unit, along with assessment of the reporting unit's strategies and forecasts of future cash flows. forecasts of individual reporting unit cash flows involve management's estimates and assumptions regarding:
•annual cash flows, on a debt-free basis, arising from future revenues and profitability, changes in working capital, capital spending and income taxes for at least a five-year forecast period.
•a terminal growth rate for years beyond the forecast period. the terminal growth rate is selected based on consideration of growth rates used in the forecast period, historical performance of the reporting unit and economic conditions.
•a discount rate that reflects the risks inherent in realizing the forecasted cash flows. a discount rate considers the risk-free rate of return on long-term treasury securities, the risk premium associated with investing in equity securities of comparable companies, the beta obtained from the comparable companies and the cost of debt for investment grade issuers. in addition, the discount rate may consider any company-specific risk in achieving the prospective financial information.
index under the market-based fair value methodology, judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions. management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of the reporting units.
based upon the revised forecasted revenues and operating income following the declaration of the covid-19 global pandemic, management concluded there was a triggering event and updated its annual 2019 goodwill impairment testing as of march 31, 2020, for certain of its dd reporting units and dx reporting units. based on the quantitative impairment assessment performed in the same manner as its annual quantitative assessment, the company concluded that the fair value was less than carrying value for two of its reporting unit and recorded a goodwill impairment of $418.7 for dd and $3.7 for dx.
management performed its annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2021. the company elected to perform the qualitative assessment for goodwill and intangible assets for the domestic dx reporting units and all of the dd reporting units and a quantitative assessment for the canadian reporting unit and its indefinite-lived assets consisting of acquired canadian licenses. based upon the results of the qualitative and quantitative assessments, the company concluded that the fair values of each of its reporting units, as of october 1, 2021, were greater than the carrying values.
although the company believes that the current assumptions and estimates used in its goodwill analysis are reasonable, supportable, and appropriate, continued efforts to maintain or improve the performance of these businesses could be impacted by unfavorable or unforeseen changes which could impact the existing assumptions used in the impairment analysis. various factors could reasonably be expected to unfavorably impact existing assumptions: primarily delays in new customer bookings and the related delay in revenue from new customers, increases in customer termination activity or increases in operating costs. in addition, given the ongoing and rapidly changing nature of the covid-19 pandemic, there is significant uncertainty regarding the duration and severity of the pandemic as well as any future government restrictions, which may unfavorably impact existing assumptions. accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for the purposes of the goodwill impairment analysis will prove to be accurate predictions of future performance.

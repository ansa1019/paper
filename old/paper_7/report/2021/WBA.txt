introduction and segments walgreens boots alliance, inc. and its subsidiaries is a global leader in retail pharmacy. its operations are conducted through two reportable segments:
•united states; and
•international see note 17 segment reporting and note 18 sales, to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 below for additional information.
factors, trends and uncertainties affecting our results and comparability the company has been, and we expect it to continue to be affected by a number of factors that may cause actual results to differ from our historical results or current expectations. these factors include: the impact of the covid-19 pandemic ("covid-19") on our operations and financial results; the financial performance of our equity method investees, including amerisourcebergen; the influence of certain holidays; seasonality; foreign currency rates; changes in vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms and associated reimbursement pressure; strategic transactions and acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and other strategic collaborations; changes in laws, including u.s. tax law changes; changes in trade tariffs, including trade relations between the u.s. and china, and international relations, including the uk's withdrawal from the european union and its impact on our operations and prospects, and those of our customers and counterparties; the timing and magnitude of cost reduction initiatives, including under our transformational cost management program (as defined below); the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season; fluctuations in variable costs; the impacts of looting, natural disasters, war, terrorism and other catastrophic events, and changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which the company operates.
specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the u.s., a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies. to better serve the evolving specialty pharmacy market, in march 2017, we and prime therapeutics llc, a pbm, closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company, alliancerx walgreens prime, using an innovative model that seeks to align pharmacy, pbm and health plans to coordinate patient care, improve health outcomes and deliver cost of care opportunities. certain clients of our joint venture were and are not obligated to contract through our joint venture, and have in the past, and may in the future, enter into specialty pharmacy and other agreements without involving our joint venture. over the last year, certain clients have chosen not to renew their contracts through our joint venture which will impact gross sales. however, considering the relatively low margin nature of this business, we do not anticipate this having a material impact on operating income.
these and other factors can affect the company's operations and net earnings for any period and may cause such results not to be comparable to the same period in previous years. the results presented in this report are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.
covid-19
covid-19 has severely impacted, and may continue to impact, the economies of the u.s., the uk and other countries around the world. covid-19 has created significant public health concerns as well as significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption in every region in which we operate, which has adversely affected, and may again adversely affect, our industries and our business operations. further, financial and credit markets experienced, and may again experience, volatility. policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of covid-19 have resulted in, among other things, temporary closure or reduced hours of operation of certain store locations in the u.s., the uk and other countries, reduced customer traffic and sales in our retail pharmacies and the adoption of work-from-home policies.
wba fiscal 2021 form 10-k table of content in response to covid-19, various domestic and foreign federal, state and local governmental legislation, regulations, orders, policies and initiatives have been implemented that are designed to reduce the transmission of covid-19, as well as to help address economic and market volatility and instability resulting from covid-19. the company has assessed and will continue to assess the impact of these governmental actions on the company. the company has participated in certain of these programs, including for example availing itself to certain tax deferrals which were introduced by the cares act in the u.s. and certain tax deferral and benefit and employee wage support in the uk, and if available, may continue to do so in the future.
during the first half of fiscal 2021, the company experienced certain adverse impacts of covid-19. sales were negatively impacted within the united states segment driven by low level of flu incidences as social distancing measures continued to remain in place across the u.s. sales were also negatively impacted within the international segment, which reflected a reduction in footfall in boots uk stores as a second national lockdown was declared in november 2020. the company took measures to keep stores open, incurring incremental selling, general and administrative expenses including higher employee costs and store expenses related to social distancing and incremental cleaning, covid-19 drive-through testing sites expenses, safeguarding store environments as well as preparing for the rollout of mass vaccinations. in the beginning of fiscal 2021, the company also took certain actions to partly mitigate the impact of covid-19 through cost containment across the company including temporary store closures and decreasing store hours and reducing rent at some locations. the company's operating income was significantly and adversely impacted during the first half of fiscal 2021 as a result of covid-19.
during the second half of fiscal 2021, the company experienced sequential improvement compared to the first half of fiscal 2021 as sales and comparable scripts were positively impacted within the united states segment due to the acceleration of covid-19 vaccination rollout and a recovery in retail. the united states segment's operating income was also positively impacted as a result of covid-19 vaccines administered, net of incremental labor and other costs related to the vaccination program. the international segment experienced a rebound in retail sales and operating income during the second half of fiscal 2021 resulting from the phased reopening of the uk high street and less severe covid-19 restrictions. however, despite these improvements during the second half of fiscal 2021, store footfall in the uk remained below pre-covid-19 levels.
the company has taken a number of proactive actions consistent with regulatory directives, such as digital 'order ahead' drive-through offering services with an increased range of products available for drive-through pick-up and curbside collection and put in place new delivery options available nationwide in the u.s during fiscal 2021. to continue to work with customers and manage operations through the pandemic, the company launched a new covid-19 testing program for businesses in fiscal 2020. as of august 31, 2021, the company has administered 12.9 million covid-19 tests in the u.s. as part of its test & protect efforts. in the international segment, boots administered more than 3.7 million covid-19 tests in the uk, mostly undertaken in partnership with the national health service ("nhs"). boots uk has a growing private test offering with several at home and in-store tests available, in addition to testing partnerships with several major airlines.
the company has worked with the centers for disease control and prevention ("cdc"), u.s. department of health and human services ("hhs") and the u.s. government to help administer covid-19 vaccines to high priority groups, including long-term care facility residents and staff. the united states segment also expanded vaccination models to ensure convenient access, including same-day and walk-in appointments, mobile clinics, employer partnerships and extended hours. as of august 31, 2021, the united states segment had administered approximately 34.6 million covid-19 vaccinations, including 13.5 million in the three months ended august 31, 2021.
the situation surrounding covid-19 remains fluid, and could result in additional mandates and directives, including revisions thereto, from foreign, federal, state, county and city authorities throughout the continuation of the covid-19 pandemic and for some time thereafter. the impact on the u.s. and global economies and consumer, customer and health care utilization patterns depends upon the evolving factors and future developments related to covid-19. as a result, the financial and/or operational impact on the company, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact, singularly or collectively, could be material and adverse.
the company's current expectations described above are forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ. factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed below under "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" and in item 1a, risk factors.

wba fiscal 2021 form 10-k table of content transformational cost management program on december 20, 2018, the company announced a transformational cost management program that was expected to deliver in excess of $2.0 billion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2022 (the "transformational cost management program"). at the end of fiscal 2021, the company had delivered this annual cost savings goal.
building on the successful implementation of the transformational cost management program to date and as part of the company's strategic realignment to create even greater focus on the company's core business, on october 12, 2021, the company's board of directors approved an expansion and extension of the transformational cost management program through the end of fiscal 2024. the expanded transformational cost management program is expected to deliver incremental savings from existing programs and a comprehensive funnel of new initiatives which are intended to improve operating effectiveness and better position the core business for the future. the expansion of the program reflects further strategic initiatives to optimize real estate, implement a global business and centralized services model, as well as leverage technology and new business models to streamline processes across the organization. as a result, the company is increasing its annual savings target to $3.3 billion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2024.
the transformational cost management program, which is multi-faceted and includes divisional optimization initiatives, global smart spending, global smart organization and the transformation of the company's information technology (it) capabilities, is designed to help the company achieve increased cost efficiencies. to date, the company has taken actions across all aspects of the transformational cost management program. the actions under the transformational cost management program focus on all reportable segments and the company's global functions. divisional optimization within each of the company's segments includes activities such as optimization of stores. as a result of the expanded program, the company now plans to reduce its presence by up to 150 boots stores in the uk and up to 150 stores in the united states over the next three years, which are incremental to the previously planned reduction of approximately 200 boots stores in the uk and approximately 250 stores in the united states.
the company currently estimates that the transformational cost management program will result in cumulative pre-tax charges to its gaap financial results of approximately $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, of which $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion are expected to be recorded as exit and disposal activities. the company estimates that approximately 85% of the cumulative pre-tax charges relating to the transformational cost management program represent current or future cash expenditures, primarily related to employee severance and business transition costs, it transformation and lease and other real estate payments.

other income for fiscal 2020 was $77 million compared to $243 million for fiscal 2019. the decrease primarily reflects gains resulting from the termination of the option granted to rite aid to become a member of the company's group purchasing organization in fiscal 2019.

these supplemental non-gaap financial measures are presented because management has evaluated the company's financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation, as applicable, and believes that the supplemental non-gaap financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the company's business from period to period and trends in the company's historical operating results. these supplemental non-gaap financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the gaap financial measures presented herein.
the company does not provide a reconciliation for non-gaap estimates on a forward-looking basis where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. this is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of the company's control or cannot be reasonably predicted, and that would impact the most directly comparable forward-looking gaap financial measure. for the same reasons, the company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. forward-looking non-gaap financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding gaap financial measures.

commitments and contingencies the information set forth in note 11 commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k is incorporated herein by reference.
critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and include amounts based on management's prudent judgments and estimates. actual results may differ from these estimates. management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. to the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the consolidated statements of earnings and corresponding consolidated balance sheets accounts would be necessary. these adjustments would be made in future periods. some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, leases, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, long-lived assets impairment, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes. the company uses the following methods to determine its estimates:
business combinations - the company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. the determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.
for intangible assets, the company generally uses the income approach to determine fair value. the income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: discount rates, terminal growth rates, royalty rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. the discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections.
although the company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. changes in assumptions concerning future wba fiscal 2021 form 10-k table of content financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.
judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset's useful life.
leases - the company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. the lease classification is determined at the commencement date. right-of-use assets represent the company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease during the lease term. right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments during the lease term. lease commencement is the date the company has the right to control the property. the company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments. the incremental borrowing rate is based on the company's estimated rate of interest for a collateralized borrowing over a similar term as the lease term. the operating lease right-of-use assets also include lease payments made before commencement, lease incentives and are recorded net of impairment. operating leases are expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term.
the lease term of real estate leases includes renewal options that are reasonably certain of being exercised. options to extend are considered reasonably certain of being exercised based on evaluation if there are significant investments within the leased property which have useful lives greater than the non-cancelable lease term, performance of the underlying store and the company's economic and strategic initiatives. short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets.
the company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component. variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at the commencement of the lease such as increases in lease payments based on changes in index rates or usage, are not included in the right-of-use assets or lease liabilities. these are expensed as incurred. the company has real estate leases which require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs and hence are not included in the lease payments used to calculate lease liability. other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. these fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. the company does not separately account for the land portion of the leases involving land and building.
finance leases are recognized within property, plant and equipment and as a finance lease liability within accrued expenses and other liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment - goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. as part of the company's impairment analysis, fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both the income and market approaches. the income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. the market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping.
indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. the determination of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangibles requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: forecasts of revenue, the selection of appropriate royalty rate and discount rates.
the determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the business and financial performance of the company's reporting units, as well as how such performance may be impacted by covid-19. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures, including considering the impact of covid-19.
although the company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions, including the impact of covid-19, could have a significant impact on either wba fiscal 2021 form 10-k table of content the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles, the amount of any goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges, or both. these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, the impact of covid-19, its severity, duration and its impact on global economies, general economic conditions as well as our profitability. the company will continue to monitor these potential impacts, including the impact of covid-19 and economic, industry and market trends and the impact these may have on boots and other international reporting units.
the company also compares the sum of estimated fair values of reporting units to the company's fair value as implied by the market value of its equity securities. this comparison provides an indication that, in total, assumptions and estimates are reasonable. future declines in the overall market value of the company's equity securities may provide an indication that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.
see note 7 goodwill and other intangible assets, to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii. item 8 for additional information.
impairment of long lived assets - the company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. the evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. long-lived assets related to the company's retail operations include property, plant and equipment, definite-lived intangibles, right of use asset as well as operating lease liability. if the asset group fails the recoverability test, then an impairment charge is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the asset group compared to its carrying value. fair value of the asset group is generally determined using income approach based on cash flows expected from the use and eventual disposal of the asset group.
the determination of the fair value of the asset group requires management to estimate a number of factors including anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates.
cost of sales and inventory - cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence and supplier rebates. in addition to product costs, cost of sales includes warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances.
cost of sales is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts. inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the last-in, first-out ("lifo") method for the united states segment and on an average cost and first-in first-out ("fifo") basis for inventory in the international segment.
equity method investments - the company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. the company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of these investees is included in consolidated net earnings. judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the company's ownership interest, legal form of the investee (e.g. limited liability partnership), representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intra-entity transactions.
the company evaluates equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. factors considered by the company when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investee's financial condition and near-term prospects and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. an impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified.
pension and postretirement benefits - the company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its non-u.s. employees. the company also has a postretirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying u.s. employees. eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants' status, date of hire and or length of service. pension and postretirement healthcare plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third-party actuaries in calculating those amounts. these assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors.
in determining long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, the company considers both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long-term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio. a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on its pension expense. a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate wba fiscal 2021 form 10-k table of content would result in a decline of $443 million to the company's pension benefit obligation. a 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase the company's pension expense by $26 million.
the company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. the postretirement healthcare plan is not funded.
income taxes -the company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. u.s. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the company's tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. in evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions, the company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other non-current liabilities and current income taxes on the company's consolidated balance sheets and in income tax provision in its consolidated statements of earnings.
in determining its provision for income taxes, the company uses income, permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates. the provision for income taxes rate also reflects its assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the u.s. discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.

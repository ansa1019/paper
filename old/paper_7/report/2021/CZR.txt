merger and acquisitions related activities acquisition of william hill on september 30, 2020, we announced that we had reached an agreement with william hill plc on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition pursuant to which we would acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital (other than shares owned by us or held in treasury) of william hill plc, in an all-cash transaction. on april 22, 2021, the company completed the acquisition for £2.9 billion, or approximately $3.9 billion.
in connection with the william hill acquisition, on april 22, 2021, a newly formed subsidiary of the company entered into a credit agreement (the "bridge credit agreement") with certain lenders party thereto and deutsche bank ag, london branch, as administrative agent and collateral agent, pursuant to which the lenders party thereto provided the debt financing (as defined below). the bridge credit agreement provides for (a) a 540-day £1.0 billion asset sale bridge facility, (b) a 60-day £503 million cash confirmation bridge facility and (c) a 540-day £116 million revolving credit facility (collectively, the "debt financing"). the proceeds of the bridge loan facilities provided under the bridge credit agreement were used (i) to pay a portion of the cash consideration for the acquisition and (ii) to pay fees and expenses related to the acquisition and related transactions. the proceeds of the revolving credit facility under the bridge credit agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. the £1.5 billion interim facilities agreement ("interim facilities agreement") entered into on october 6, 2020 with deutsche bank ag, london branch and jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., and amended on december 11, 2020, was terminated upon the execution of the bridge credit agreement. on may 12, 2021, the company repaid the £503 million cash confirmation bridge facility. on june 14, 2021, the company drew down the full £116 million from the revolving credit facility and the proceeds, in addition to excess company cash, were used to make a partial repayment of the asset sale bridge facility in the amount of £700 million. outstanding borrowings under the bridge credit agreement are expected to be repaid upon the sale of william hill's non-u.s. operations including the uk and international online divisions and the retail betting shops (collectively, "william hill international"), all of which are held for sale and reflected within discontinued operations. certain investments acquired will be excluded from the held for sale group.
on september 8, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell william hill international to 888 holdings plc for approximately £2.2 billion. after repayment of the outstanding debt under the bridge credit agreement, described above, and other working capital adjustments, the company expects to receive approximately £835 million, or $1.2 billion, subject to any permitted leakage, which is customary for sale transactions in the uk. the sale is subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, including receipt of the approval of shareholders of 888 holdings plc and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022.
we recognized acquisition-related transaction costs of $68 million and $8 million for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, excluding additional transaction cost associated with sale of william hill international. these costs were associated with legal and professional services and were recorded in transaction costs and other operating costs in our statements of operations.
consolidation of horseshoe baltimore on august 26, 2021, we increased our ownership interest in cbac borrower, llc ("horseshoe baltimore"), a property which we also managed, to approximately 75.8% for cash consideration of $55 million. we were subsequently determined to have a controlling financial interest in horseshoe baltimore and have consolidated the results of operations of the property following our change in ownership. as a result of the increase in our ownership interest, our previously held investment was remeasured and we recognized a gain of $40 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. management fees received prior to the consolidation event have been presented within our managed and branded segment. operations following the consolidation event are presented within our regional segment.
merger with caesars entertainment corporation on july 20, 2020, the merger was consummated and former caesars became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. the strategic rationale for the merger includes, but is not limited to, the following:
•creation of the largest owner, operator and manager of domestic gaming assets
•diversification of the company's domestic footprint
•access to iconic brands, rewards programs and new gaming opportunities expected to enhance customer experience
•realization of significant identified synergies the total purchase consideration for former caesars was $10.9 billion. the estimated purchase consideration in the acquisition was determined with reference to its acquisition date fair value.
we recognized acquisition-related transaction costs in connection with the merger of $30 million, $160 million and $80 million for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
investments and partnerships neogames the acquired net assets of william hill included an investment in neogames s.a. ("neogames"), a global leader of ilottery solutions and services to national and state-regulated lotteries, and other investments. on september 16, 2021, the company sold a portion of its shares of neogames common stock for $136 million which decreased its ownership interest from 24.5% to approximately 8.4%. as of december 31, 2021, the company held approximately 2 million shares of neogames common stock with a fair value of $60 million. the shares have a readily determinable fair value and, accordingly, the company remeasures the investment based on the publicly available share price (level 1). for the year ended december 31, 2021, the company recorded a loss to the investment in neogames of $54 million, which is included within other income (loss) on the statements of operations.
the stars group/flutter entertainment in november 2018, the company entered into a 20-year agreement with the stars group inc. ("tsg") pursuant to which we agreed to provide tsg with options to obtain access to our second skin for online sports wagering and third skin for real money online gaming and poker, in each case with respect to states in which our properties are located. under the terms of the agreement, we received 1 million tsg common shares. the fair value of the shares received was deferred and was recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the 20-year agreement term. in addition, we received a revenue share from the operation of the applicable verticals by tsg under our licenses. in december 2020, the company sold a portion of these flutter shares for net proceeds of $24 million.
on july 7, 2021, the company sold all remaining flutter shares for $9 million. the company recorded a loss of $1 million during the year ended december 31, 2021, which is included within other income (loss) on our statements of operations.
pompano joint venture in april 2018, the company entered into a joint venture with cordish companies ("cordish") to plan and develop a mixed-use entertainment and hospitality destination expected to be located on unused land adjacent to the casino and racetrack at the company's pompano property. as the managing member, cordish will operate the business and manage the development, construction, financing, marketing, leasing, maintenance and day-to-day operation of the various phases of the project. additionally, cordish will be responsible for the development of the master plan for the project with the company's input and will submit it for the company's review and approval. in june 2021, the joint venture issued a capital call and we contributed $3 million, for a total of $4 million in cash since the inception of the joint venture. on february 12, 2021, the company contributed 186 acres to the joint venture with a fair value of $61 million. total contributions of approximately 206 acres of land have been made with a fair value of approximately $69 million, and the company has no further obligation to contribute additional real estate or cash as of december 31, 2021. we entered into a short-term lease agreement in february 2021, which we can cancel at any time, to lease back a portion of the land from the joint venture.
while the company holds a 50% variable interest in the joint venture, it is not the primary beneficiary; as such the investment in the joint venture is accounted for using the equity method. the company participates evenly with cordish in the profits and losses of the joint venture, which are included in transaction costs and other operating costs on the statements of operations. as of december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020, the company's investment in the joint venture is recorded in investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates on the balance sheets.
reportable segments segment results in this md&a are presented consistent with the way our management reviews operating results, assesses performance and makes decisions on a "significant market" basis. management views each of the company's casinos as an operating segment. operating segments are aggregated based on their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, types of services and products provided, and their management and reporting structure. prior to the william hill acquisition, our principal operating activities occurred in three regionally-focused reportable segments: las vegas, regional, and managed, international, cie, in addition to corporate and other.
the william hill acquisition and rebranding of our interactive business (formerly, caesars interactive entertainment "cie" and now, inclusive of william hill us, "caesars digital") expanded our access to conduct sports wagering and igaming gaming operations. as a result, the company has made a change to the composition of its reportable segments. the las vegas and regional segments are substantially unchanged, while the former managed, international and cie reportable segment has been recast for all periods presented into two segments; caesars digital and managed and branded. accordingly, our principal operating activities occur in four reportable segments: (1) las vegas, (2) regional, (3) caesars digital, and (4) managed and branded, in addition to corporate and other. see item 2. "properties" for listing of properties by segment.
presentation of financial information the financial information included in this item 7 for the periods after our acquisitions of former caesars on july 20, 2020, william hill on april 22, 2021 and of the increase in our ownership percentage and subsequent consolidation of horseshoe baltimore on august 26, 2021, is not fully comparable to the periods prior to the acquisitions. in addition, the presentation of financial information herein for the periods after the company's sales of various properties is not fully comparable to the periods prior to their respective sale dates. refer to "reportable segments" above for a discussion of changes to the company's reportable segments.
this md&a is intended to provide information to assist in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. our historical operating results may not be indicative of our future results of operations because of the factors described in the preceding paragraph and the changing competitive landscape in each of our markets, including changes in market and societal trends, as well as by factors discussed elsewhere herein. we recommend that you read this md&a in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
reclassifications certain reclassifications of prior year presentations have been made to conform to the current period presentation. in june 2021, the indiana gaming commission amended its order that previously required the company to sell a third casino asset in the state of indiana. as a result, horseshoe hammond no longer meets the held for sale criteria. the assets and liabilities previously held for sale have been reclassified as held and used for all periods presented measured at the lower of the carrying amount, adjusted for depreciation and amortization that would have been recognized had the assets been continuously classified as held and used, and the fair value at the date of the amended ruling. additionally, amounts previously presented in discontinued operations have been reclassified into continuing operations for all periods presented.
key performance metrics our primary source of revenue is generated by our gaming operations, retail and online sports betting, as well as online gaming. additionally we utilize our hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment venues, retail shops, racing and other services to attract customers to our properties. our operating results are highly dependent on the volume and quality of customers visiting and staying at our properties and using our sports betting and igaming applications.
key performance metrics include volume indicators such as drop or handle, which refer to amounts wagered by our customers. the amount of volume we retain, which is not fully controllable by us, is recognized as casino revenues and is referred to as our win or hold. slot win percentage is typically in the range of approximately 9% to 11% of slot handle for both the las vegas and regional segments. table game hold percentage is typically in the range of approximately 14% to 23% of table game drop in the las vegas segment and 18% to 21% of table game drop in the regional segment. sports betting hold is typically in the range of 5% to 9% and igaming hold typically ranges from 3% to 4%. in addition, hotel occupancy, which is the average percentage of available hotel rooms occupied during a period, is a key indicator for our hotel business in the las vegas segment. see "results of operations" section below. complimentary rooms are treated as occupied rooms in our calculation of hotel occupancy. the key metrics we utilize to measure our profitability and performance are adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin.
significant factors impacting financial results the following summary highlights the significant factors impacting our financial results during the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
acquisitions and transaction costs
•acquisition of william hill - on april 22, 2021, the company consummated its previously announced acquisition of the entire issued and to be issued share capital (other than shares owned by the company or held in treasury) of william hill plc, in an all-cash transaction of £2.9 billion, or approximately $3.9 billion. we recognized acquisition-related transaction costs of $68 million and $8 million for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, excluding additional transaction costs associated with sale of william hill international.
•consolidation of horseshoe baltimore - on august 26, 2021, the company increased its ownership interest in horseshoe baltimore to approximately 75.8%. prior to the purchase, the company held an interest in horseshoe baltimore of approximately 44.3% which was accounted for as an equity method investment. subsequent to the change in ownership, the company was determined to have a controlling financial interest and has begun to consolidate the operations of horseshoe baltimore. as a result of the consolidation, the company recognized a gain of $40 million during the year ended december 31, 2021.
•merger with caesars entertainment corporation - the merger closed on july 20, 2020. the company recognized acquisition-related transaction costs in connection with the merger of $30 million, $160 million and $80 million for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
divestitures and discontinued operations
•divestitures and discontinued operations - see "overview" section above for detail on properties divested or held for sale, including related discontinued operations.
financing and lease transactions
•debt transactions - in connection with the merger, we issued new notes, entered into a new credit agreement and assumed certain of former caesars indebtedness. in addition, we terminated previously outstanding credit agreements and discharged outstanding notes. during 2021, we issued $1.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2029, we repriced the incremental crc term loan, we fully converted the outstanding the 5% convertible notes, we purchased or redeemed the entire $1.7 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding crc notes of, and we purchased $100 million in aggregate principal amount of cei senior notes. as a result of these transactions, described more fully in the liquidity and capital resources section below, we experienced some interest savings subsequent to these transactions. additionally, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $236 million and
$197 million during the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which is recorded within loss on extinguishment of debt on the statement of operations.
•vici leases - upon consummation of the merger, cei assumed obligations of certain real property assets leased from vici by former caesars under various lease agreements. we recorded interest expense of $1.1 billion and $519 million for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which was in excess of the cash lease payments as we continue to accrete up the liability during the earlier periods of the vici leases. our vici leases also contain annual escalators based on the consumer price index ("cpi"), with a floor of 2%.
•glpi leases - we have accounted for the glpi leases as deferred financing obligations. we recorded interest expense in the amount of $111 million, $104 million and $99 million during the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which was in excess of the cash lease payments as we continue to accrete up the liability during the earlier periods of the glpi leases. our glpi leases also contain an annual escalation provision based on stated rates ranging from 1.25% to 2.0% per year.
other significant factors
•covid-19 public health emergency - in january 2020, an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus ("covid-19") was identified and has since spread throughout much of the world, including the u.s. all of our casino properties were temporarily closed for the period from mid-march 2020 through mid-may 2020 due to orders issued by various government agencies and tribal bodies as part of certain precautionary measures intended to help slow the spread of covid-19. during the year ended december 31, 2021, most of our properties experienced positive trends as restrictions on maximum capacities and amenities available were eased.
following temporary furloughs and salary reductions during 2020, the company has emphasized a focus on labor efficiencies as operations resumed. as properties began to reopen during the year ended december 31, 2020, certain capacity restrictions, mask mandates, sanitation guidelines, and the federal covid-19 vaccine and testing emergency temporary standard were adhered to as required by governmental or tribal orders, directives, and guidelines.
we experienced positive operating trends in 2021, with a continued focus on operational efficiencies. although we have experienced a decline in net income, adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margins for the year ended december 31, 2021 exceeded pre-pandemic levels experienced in 2019 within our las vegas and regional segments. however, certain revenue streams, such as convention and entertainment revenues, continued to be negatively impacted due to capacity restrictions in the first half of 2021. future effects of covid-19 from further outbreaks, including new variants, mask mandates or other restrictions are uncertain and could result in additional closures such as the temporary closure of caesars windsor from january 5, 2022 through january 31, 2022. extensive closure periods impacting many of our properties would have a material adverse effect on future results of operations.
•impairment charges - as a result of covid-19, we recognized impairment charges in our regional segment related to goodwill and trade names totaling $100 million and $16 million, respectively, during the year ended december 31, 2020. in addition, as a result of entering agreements to sell properties in our regional segment, impairment charges totaling $99 million were recorded during the year ended december 31, 2020 due to the carrying value exceeding the net sales proceeds. in december 2021, the company approved a capital plan which included the planned rebranding of certain of our properties, which is expected to be substantially complete by december 31, 2022. the company utilized an income approach to determine the fair value of the trademarks subject to rebranding based on their expected future cash flows, which resulted in an impairment charge of $102 million. the adjusted carrying values of these trademarks, previously considered to have indefinite lives, have begun to be amortized over their respective remaining useful lives.
•weather and construction disruption - during the third quarter of 2021, our regional segment was negatively impacted by natural disasters including hurricane ida in louisiana and mississippi and wildfires in the lake tahoe area. harrah's new orleans, harrah's lake tahoe and harvey's lake tahoe all experienced temporary closures which lasted slightly more than one week. additionally, in late august 2020, our regional segment was negatively impacted by hurricane laura, causing severe damage to lake charles, which will remain closed until the second half of 2022 when construction of a new land-based casino is expected to be complete. during the year ended december 31, 2021, we received insurance proceeds of $44 million related to damaged fixed assets and remediation costs. the company also recorded a gain of $21 million as proceeds received for the cost to replace damaged property were in excess of the respective carrying value of the assets.
•caesars sportsbook launch and rebranding - in connection with the launch and rebranding of the caesars sportsbook app during the year ended december 31, 2021, our caesars digital segment initiated a significant marketing campaign with distinguished actors, athletes and other media personalities. as new states and jurisdictions have legalized sports betting, we have made significant upfront investment which has been executed through the marketing campaign and promotional incentives to establish ourselves as an industry leader.
•post-merger synergies - we continue to identify operating and cost efficiencies, including savings from the purchasing power of the combined caesars organization and targeted integrated marketing strategies, as well as the elimination of redundant costs such as accounting and professional expenses, certain payroll costs, and other corporate costs. as a result, we experienced margin improvements in our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2021.

consolidated revenues increased for the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily due to recent acquisitions including the merger on july 20, 2020, the william hill acquisition on april 22, 2021, and the consolidation of horseshoe baltimore on august 26, 2021, offset by the divestiture of certain properties discussed above. in addition, net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by the covid-19 public health emergency. all of our casino properties were temporarily closed for the period from mid-march 2020 through mid-may 2020. further, many of our properties were operating under restrictive guidelines through the first half of 2021 due to orders issued by various government agencies and tribal bodies as part of certain precautionary measures intended to help slow the spread of covid-19. local and state regulations and the implementation of social distancing and health and safety protocols in response to covid-19 resulted in reduced gaming capacity and hotel occupancy as well as limitations on the operation of food and beverage outlets, live entertainment events, and conventions. as of december 31, 2021, all of our properties have resumed certain operations, to the extent permitted, with the exception of lake charles which was severely damaged by hurricane laura and will remain closed until the second half of 2022 when construction of a new land-based casino is expected to be completed.

casino and pari-mutuel expenses consist primarily of salaries and wages associated with our gaming operations, marketing and promotions and gaming taxes. hotel expenses consist principally of salaries, wages and supplies associated with our hotel operations. food and beverage expenses consist principally of salaries and wages and costs of goods sold associated with our food and beverage operations. other expenses consist principally of salaries and wages and costs of goods sold associated with our retail, entertainment and other operations.
casino and pari-mutuel, hotel, food and beverage, and other expenses for the year ended december 31, 2021 increased year over year as a result of our recent acquisitions, including the merger, the william hill acquisition, and the consolidation of horseshoe baltimore. in addition, the reopening of substantially all of our properties to the extent permitted by regulations governing the applicable jurisdiction, the partial return of our workforce, and advertising costs consisting of television, radio and internet marketing campaigns directly attributable to the launch and rebranding of our caesars sportsbook app contributed to the increase noted. these increases were partially offset as the company focused on labor efficiencies and post-merger synergies, as described above. additionally, during the year ended december 31, 2021, the company managed increases in food costs and effectively improved margins by focusing on efficiencies within food and beverage venues and menu options.
general and administrative expenses include items such as information technology, facility maintenance, utilities, property and liability insurance, expenses for administrative departments such as accounting, compliance, purchasing, human resources, legal and internal audit, and property taxes. general and administrative expenses also include other marketing expenses not directly related to our gaming and non-gaming operations.
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2021 increased year over year as the result of the reopening of all of our properties to the extent permitted by regulations governing the applicable jurisdiction, the merger, the william hill acquisition and the consolidation of horseshoe baltimore. these increases were partially offset by a reduced cost structure implemented by the company while our properties were temporarily closed due to the impact of covid-19. additionally, synergies associated with the combined companies from the merger and the company's focus on labor efficiencies and expense savings resulted in reductions to certain administrative costs for the year ended december 31, 2021.
corporate expenses include unallocated expenses such as payroll, annual bonus plans, stock-based compensation, professional fees, and other various expenses not directly related to the company's operations. for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the same prior year period, corporate expenses increased primarily due to the merger, the william hill acquisition and the consolidation of horseshoe baltimore. in addition, payroll costs increased as compared to the prior year period due to performance-based incentives and higher costs in the labor market. these costs have been partially offset by a decline in the corporate headcount.
for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the same prior year period, depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to the recent acquisitions, including the merger, the william hill acquisition, and the consolidation of horseshoe baltimore.
transaction costs and other operating costs primarily included expenses related to the william hill acquisition for the year ended december 31, 2021 and costs related to the merger for the year ended december 31, 2020.
impairment charges in 2021 relate to the rebranding of certain of our properties. impairment charges in 2020 relate to the impairment of goodwill and trade names recognized due to a triggering event resulting from covid-19 and agreements to sell properties whereby the carrying value exceeded the estimated net sales proceeds.

for the year ended december 31, 2021, interest expense, net increased year over year as a result of the merger, the william hill acquisition and the consolidation of horseshoe baltimore. outstanding debt assumed, additional debt raised, and assumed financing obligations resulted in the increase in interest expense. the increase was partially offset by reduction in interest expense due to the extinguishment of the 5% convertible notes, early extinguishment of the crc notes, partial repayment of the cei senior notes and the repricing of crc incremental term loan.
for the year ended december 31, 2021, the loss on extinguishment of debt was related to early repayment premiums, and extinguishment of deferred financing costs and discounts associated with the prepayments of the crc notes and cei senior notes, the repricing of the crc incremental term loan, and the early extinguishment of the 5% convertible notes. the loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31, 2020 was related to the payment of outstanding debt in connection with the merger.
for the year ended december 31, 2021, other income (loss) fluctuated year over year mainly due to a loss on the change in fair value of investments and a loss on the change in fair value of the derivative liability related to the 5% convertible notes.
the effective tax rate was 22.3% for 2021, (8.2%) for 2020, and 35.2% for 2019. the effective tax rate in 2020 differed from the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to an increase in valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets due to the series of transactions with vici during the year. such transactions did not occur in 2021. refer to item 8. - note 17 for the effective income tax rate reconciliation.

las vegas segment's net revenues and adjusted ebitda increased as a result of the merger and reopening of all of our las vegas properties in accordance with state and local regulations as of december 31, 2021. in june 2021, convention and entertainment venues began to reopen as covid-19 capacity restrictions were lifted.
during the year ended december 31, 2021, all of our reopened properties in the las vegas segment experienced an increase in net revenues and adjusted ebitda compared to former caesars' prior year results as all properties were temporarily closed for a portion of 2020. slot win percentage in las vegas during the year ended december 31, 2021 was within our typical range and hotel occupancy trended upward compared to 2020. additionally, pent up demand positively impacted our results of operations in the las vegas segment for the year ended december 31, 2021. these positive trends, however, may not be sustained due to increasing costs and continuing uncertainty relating to covid-19.

regional segment's net revenues and adjusted ebitda increased for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the same prior year period as a result of the merger and consolidation of horseshoe baltimore. the increase was slightly offset by divestitures of certain properties and closures of certain properties due to hurricane ida and the caldor fire. as of december 31, 2021, all of our properties in our regional segment reopened, with the exception of lake charles which closed due to severe damage from hurricane laura and will remain closed until the second half of 2022 when construction of a new land-based casino is expected to be completed. slot win percentage in the regional segment during the year ended december 31, 2021 was within our typical range. additionally, pent up demand positively impacted our results of operations in the regional segment for the year ended december 31, 2021. these positive trends, however, may not be sustained due to increasing costs and continuing uncertainty relating to covid-19.
for the year ended december 31, 2021, our regional segment's net revenues, adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin increased compared to the prior year across all properties, including former caesars, due to reductions in workforce and marketing costs, synergies from the purchasing power of the combined caesars organization, and the company's focus on higher margin food and beverage offerings.

(a)caesars digital generated an additional $706 million of sports betting handle, which is not included in this table for the year ended december 31, 2021, for select wholly-owned and third-party operations for which caesars digital provides services and we receive all. or a share of, the net profits. sports betting handle includes $40 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, related to horse racing and pari-mutuel wagers.
caesars digital includes caesars operations for retail and mobile sports betting, online casino, and online poker. it is comprised of the caesars interactive business acquired in the merger, operations acquired in the william hill acquisition and historical igaming at tropicana atlantic city. caesars digital's sports betting handle, igaming handle, and net revenues increased significantly for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the same prior year period due to the acquisitions and the recent marketing launch of our new sportsbook. however, net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2021 were negatively impacted by a sports betting hold percentage that was below our typical range. the low hold percentage was driven in part by increased odds and profit boosts, which are promotional enhancements that improve odds or wager payouts for customers. in addition, our hold percentage was negatively impacted by competitive pricing strategies and lower than typical hold in certain betting markets. igaming hold percentage for the year ended december 31, 2021 was within our typical range.
in connection with the launch of our caesars branded sportsbook and igaming applications, we deployed a significant level of marketing spend to build brand awareness and acquire and retain customers. as sports betting and online casinos expand through increased state legalization and customer adoption, growth in marketing and promotional costs in highly competitive markets negatively impacts caesars digital adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margins in comparison to prior periods.

we manage several properties and license rights to the use of our brands. these revenue agreements typically include reimbursement of certain costs that we incur directly. such costs are primarily related to payroll costs incurred on behalf of the properties under management. the revenue related to these reimbursable management costs has a direct impact on our evaluation of adjusted ebitda margin which, when excluded, reflects margins typically realized from such agreements. the table below presents the amount included in net revenues and total operating expenses related to these reimbursable costs.

managed and branded segment's net revenues and adjusted ebitda increased as a result of the merger. upon the consolidation of horseshoe baltimore, the operations of the property are included in the regional segment above and management revenue is eliminated upon consolidation. additionally, in connection with the closing of the sale of caesars southern indiana on september 3, 2021, the company and the eastern band of cherokee indians ("ebci") extended their existing relationship by entering into a 10-year brand license agreement, with cancellation rights in exchange for a termination fee at the buyer's discretion following the fifth anniversary of the agreement, for the continued use of the caesars brand and caesars rewards loyalty program at caesars southern indiana. caesars southern indiana was previously reported within the regional segment and subsequent to the sale, as a result of the license agreement relating to the continued use of the caesars brand and caesars rewards loyalty program at caesars southern indiana, is reported within the managed and branded segment. all of our managed properties have reopened as of december 31, 2021, however, a subsequent temporary closure of caesars windsor occurred from january 5, 2022 through january 31, 2022 due to covid - 19.
for the year ended december 31, 2021, net revenues and adjusted ebitda for managed and branded increased as compared to former caesars' prior period.

supplemental unaudited presentation of consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("adjusted ebitda") for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019
adjusted ebitda (described below), a non-gaap financial measure, has been presented as a supplemental disclosure because it is a widely used measure of performance and basis for valuation of companies in our industry and we believe that this non-gaap supplemental information will be helpful in understanding our ongoing operating results. management has historically used adjusted ebitda when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items is necessary to provide a full understanding of our core operating results and as a means to evaluate period-to-period results. adjusted ebitda represents net income (loss) before interest income or interest expense net of interest capitalized, (benefit) provision for income taxes, unrealized (gain) loss on investments and marketable securities, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, impairment charges, transaction expenses, severance expense, selling costs associated with the divestitures of properties, equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates, (gain) loss on the sale or disposal of property and equipment, (gain) loss related to divestitures, changes in the fair value of certain derivatives and certain non-recurring expenses such as sign-on and retention bonuses, business optimization expenses and transformation expenses, certain litigation awards and settlements, losses on inventory associated with properties temporarily closed as a result of the covid-19 public health emergency, contract exit or termination costs, and certain regulatory settlements. adjusted ebitda also excludes the expense associated with certain of our leases as these transactions were accounted for as financing obligations and the associated expense is included in interest expense. adjusted ebitda is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with gaap. adjusted ebitda is unaudited and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance. uses of cash flows that are not reflected in adjusted ebitda include capital expenditures, interest payments, income taxes, debt principal repayments, payments under our leases with affiliates of glpi and vici properties inc. and certain regulatory gaming assessments, which can be significant. as a result, adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity. other companies that provide ebitda information may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do. the definition of adjusted ebitda may not be the same as the definitions used in any of our debt agreements.
the following table summarizes our adjusted ebitda for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in addition to reconciling net income (loss) to adjusted ebitda in accordance with gaap (unaudited):

other liquidity matters we are faced with certain contingencies, from time to time, involving litigation, claims, assessments, environmental remediation or compliance. these commitments and contingencies are discussed in greater detail in "part i, item 3. legal proceedings" and note 11 to our financial statements, both of which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. in addition, new competition among retail and online operations may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and could have a similar adverse effect on our liquidity. see "part i, item 1a. risk factors-risks related to our business" which is included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with gaap. in preparing our financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving regard to materiality. when more than one accounting principle, or method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that we consider to be the most appropriate under specific circumstances. application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties. certain of our accounting policies, including those in connection with business combinations, certain fair value measurements, income taxes, long-lived assets, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, allowance for doubtful accounts related to certain gaming receivables, self-insurance reserves, and litigation, claims and assessments require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates.
we consider accounting estimates to be critical accounting policies when:
•the estimates involve matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made; and
•different estimates or changes to estimates could have a material impact on the reported financial position, changes in financial position, or results of operations.
by their nature, these judgments and estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. our judgments and estimates are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, observance of trends in the industry, information gathered from customer behavior, and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. due to the inherent uncertainty involving judgments and estimates, actual results may differ from those estimates.
our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas:
business combinations we applied the provisions of accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 805, "business combinations," in the accounting for our acquisitions of former caesars, william hill plc, and our additional interest in horseshoe baltimore. it required us to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values, which were determined using market, income, and cost approaches, or a combination. goodwill as of the respective acquisition dates was measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. goodwill is generally the result of expected synergies of the combined company or an assembled workforce.
indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired primarily include trademarks, caesars rewards acquired in the merger, customer relationships and gaming rights. the fair value for these intangible assets was determined using either the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method under the income approach or a replacement cost market approach.
acquired trademarks, developed technology and caesars rewards were valued using the relief from royalty method, which presumes that without ownership of such trademarks, technology, or loyalty program, we would have to make a stream of payments to a third party in return for the right to use their name, technology, or program. by virtue of this asset, we avoid any such payments and record the related intangible value of the company's ownership of the brand name, technology, or program.
customer relationships were valued using the cost approach and the incremental cash flow method under the income approach. the incremental cash flow method compares the prospective cash flows with and without the customer relationships in place to estimate the fair value of the customer relationships, with the fair value assumed to be equal to the discounted cash flows of the business that would be lost if the customer relationships were not in place and needed to be replaced.
gaming rights include our gaming licenses in various jurisdictions and may have indefinite lives or an estimated useful life. the fair value of the gaming rights was determined using the excess earnings or replacement cost methodology, based on whether the license resides in gaming jurisdictions where competition is limited to a specified number of licensed gaming operators. the excess earnings methodology is an income approach that estimates the projected cash flows of the business attributable to the gaming license intangible asset, which is net of charges for the use of other identifiable assets of the business including working capital, fixed assets and other intangible assets. the replacement cost of the gaming license was used as an indicator of fair value.
trade receivables and payables and other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities were valued at the existing carrying values as they represented the estimated fair value of those items at the acquisition date. assets and liabilities held for sale are recorded at fair value, less costs to sell, based on the agreements reached as of the acquisition date, or an income approach.
the fair value of the financing obligations were calculated as the net present value of both the fixed base rent payments and the forecasted variable payments plus the expected residual value of the land and building returned at the end of the expected usage period.
reacquired rights were valued using the excess earnings method that reflects the present value of the future profit william hill expected to earn over the remaining term of the contract, adjusted for returns of other assets that contribute to the generation of this profit, such as working capital, fixed assets and other intangible assets. the forecasted profit used within the valuation was adjusted for the settlement of the preexisting relationship as a component of the purchase consideration.
fair value of land was determined using the sales comparable approach. the market data is then adjusted for any significant differences, to the extent known, between the identified comparable sites and the site being valued. the value of building and site improvements was estimated via the income approach. other personal property assets such as furniture, gaming and computer equipment, fixtures, computer software, and restaurant equipment were valued using the cost approach which is based on replacement or reproduction costs of the asset. the cost approach is an estimation of fair value developed by computing the current cost of replacing a property and subtracting any depreciation resulting from one or more of the following factors: physical deterioration, functional obsolescence, and/or economic obsolescence.
assets and liabilities which are designated as held for sale on an acquisition date are also measured at fair value, utilizing similar market, income and cost approaches described above, based on the underlying asset class held for sale.
cash flow estimates are significant to many valuations described above and may include forecasts with assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance, future growth rates, and the determination of appropriate discount rates to estimate fair value. these inputs involve significant assumptions including the future effects of covid-19 as well as the realization of synergies anticipated from a business combination, which may not be realized as projected. certain assumptions, such as the effects of covid-19, may be beyond our control.
fair value measurements we use interest rate swaps, which are derivative instruments classified as hedging transactions, to limit our exposure to interest rate risk. derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements at fair value. the estimated fair values of our derivative instruments are based on market prices obtained from dealer quotes. such quotes represent the estimated amounts we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts. our derivative instruments contain a credit risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. we minimize that risk by evaluating the creditworthiness of our counterparties, which are limited to major banks and financial institutions. the fair values of our derivative instruments are adjusted for the credit rating of the counterparty, if the derivative is an asset, or adjusted for the credit rating of the company, if the derivative is a liability.
see note 8 for more details regarding fair value measurements and item 7a for quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
income taxes we and our subsidiaries file income tax returns with federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service ("irs") and other tax authorities. positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the irs or other tax authorities. see note 17 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities.
we record income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and as attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. we reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on the "more likely than not" realization threshold. this assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives.
when there is a recent history of operating losses and negative normalized earnings and a return to operating profitability has not yet been demonstrated, we cannot rely on projections of future taxable earnings for purposes of assessing recoverability of our deferred tax assets. in such cases, we use systematic and logical methods to estimate when deferred tax liabilities will reverse and generate taxable income and when deferred tax assets will reverse and generate tax deductions. our most significant deferred tax asset relates to the failed sale-leaseback obligation with vici and glpi (see note 10). the reversal of this deferred tax asset requires judgment and estimates and has a material impact on the determination of the amount of valuation allowance required.
under the applicable accounting standards, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the accounting standards also provide guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions.
long-lived assets we have significant capital invested in our long-lived assets, and judgments are made in determining the estimated useful lives of assets, salvage values to be assigned to assets, and if or when an asset has been impaired. the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized in our financial results and whether we have a gain or loss on the disposal of an asset. we assign lives to our assets based on our standard policy, which is established by management as representative of the useful life of each category of asset. we review the carrying value of our long-lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. the factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, planned construction and renovation projects, as well as the effect of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic, legal, and regulatory factors. in estimating expected future cash flows for determining whether an asset is impaired, assets are grouped at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which, for most of our assets, is the individual property. see note 6 for additional information.
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets assessing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment is a process that requires significant judgment and involves detailed qualitative and quantitative business-specific analysis and many individual assumptions which fluctuate between assessments.
we determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit based on a combination of ebitda, valuation multiples, and estimated future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the capital structure and cost of capital of comparable market participants, giving appropriate consideration to the prevailing borrowing rates within the casino industry in general. we also evaluate the aggregate fair value of all of our reporting units and other non-operating assets in comparison to our aggregate debt and equity market capitalization at the test date. ebitda multiples and discounted cash flows are common measures used to value businesses in our industry.
we determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets using either the relief from royalty method or the excess earnings method under the income approach or replacement cost market approach. the determination of fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets requires management to make significant assumptions and estimates around the forecasts as well as the selection of discount rates and valuation multiples. changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our reporting units, intangible assets and result in potential impairment.
forecasts and the determination of appropriate discount rates and valuation multiples used to determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets involves significant assumptions and estimates. assumptions include those used to assess future effects of covid-19 as well as the realization of synergies anticipated from acquisitions which may not be realized at the projected rate.
we acquired william hill plc on april 22, 2021 and allocated the total purchase consideration transferred to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values and therefore, the fair value of the acquired reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets do not significantly exceed their respective carrying values. as of october 1, 2021, one other reporting unit in the regional segment with goodwill totaling $420 million had a fair value that did not significantly exceed its respective carrying values. to the extent gaming volumes deteriorate in the near future, discount rates increase significantly, or we do not meet our projected performance, we may recognize further impairments, and such impairments could be material. in addition, $352 million of goodwill within our regional segment is associated with reporting units with zero or negative carrying value. see note 7 for additional information.
allowance for doubtful accounts - gaming we reserve an estimated amount for gaming receivables that may not be collected to reduce the company's receivables to their net carrying amount. methodologies for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts range from specific reserves to various percentages applied to aged receivables. historical collection rates are considered, as are customer relationships, in determining specific reserves. as with many estimates, management must make judgments about potential actions by third parties in establishing and evaluating our reserves for allowance for doubtful accounts. as of december 31, 2021, a 5% increase or decrease to the allowance determined based on a percentage of aged receivables would change the reserve by approximately $14 million.
self-insurance reserves we are self-insured for various levels of general liability, employee medical insurance coverage and workers' compensation coverage. insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims, as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported. we utilize independent consultants to assist management in its determination of estimated insurance liabilities. while the total cost of claims incurred depends on future developments, in managements' opinion, recorded reserves are adequate to cover future claims payments. self-insurance reserves for employee medical claims, workers' compensations and general liability claims are included self-insurance claims and reserves within accrued other liabilities on the balance sheets. see note 9.
the assumptions, including those related to the covid-19 public health emergency, utilized by our actuaries are subject to significant uncertainty and if outcomes differ from these assumptions or events develop or progress in a negative manner, the company could experience a material adverse effect and additional liabilities may be recorded in the future.
litigation, claims and assessments we utilize estimates for litigation, claims and assessments. these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events, as well as assumptions about future events. if our assessment of such a matter should change, we may have to change the estimates, which may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. actual results could differ from these estimates.

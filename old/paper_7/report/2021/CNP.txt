item 7.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations no registrant makes any representations as to the information related solely to centerpoint energy or the subsidiaries of centerpoint energy other than itself.
the following combined discussion and analysis should be read in combination with the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 herein. when discussing centerpoint energy's consolidated financial information, it includes the results of houston electric and cerc, which, along with centerpoint energy, are collectively referred to as the registrants. where appropriate, information relating to a specific registrant has been segregated and labeled as such. unless the context indicates otherwise, specific references to houston electric and cerc also pertain to centerpoint energy. in this combined form 10-k, the terms "our," "we" and "us" are used as abbreviated references to centerpoint energy, inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries.
overview background centerpoint energy, inc. is a public utility holding company. centerpoint energy's operating subsidiaries own and operate electric transmission, distribution and generation and natural gas distribution facilities, and provide energy performance contracting and sustainable infrastructure services. for a detailed description of centerpoint energy's operating subsidiaries and discontinued operations, please read note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
houston electric is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of centerpoint energy that provides electric transmission service to transmission service customers in the ercot region and distribution service to reps serving the texas gulf coast area that includes the city of houston.
cerc corp. is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of centerpoint energy that owns and operates natural gas distribution facilities in several states, with operating subsidiaries that own and operate permanent pipeline connections through interconnects with various interstate and intrastate pipeline companies.
reportable segments in this management's discussion and analysis, we discuss our results from continuing operations on a consolidated basis and individually for each of our reportable segments, which are listed below. we also discuss our liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies. we are first and foremost an energy delivery company and it is our intention to remain focused on these segments of the energy business. the results of our business operations are significantly impacted by weather, customer growth, economic conditions, cost management, competition, rate proceedings before regulatory agencies and other actions of the various regulatory agencies to whose jurisdiction we are subject, among other factors.
as of december 31, 2021, centerpoint energy's reportable segments were electric and natural gas.
•the electric reportable segment includes electric transmission and distribution services that are subject to rate regulation in houston electric's and indiana electric's service territories, as well as the impacts of generation-related stranded costs and other true-up balances recoverable by the regulated electric utility and energy delivery services to electric customers and electric generation assets to serve electric customers and optimize those assets in the wholesale power market in indiana electric's service territory. for further information about the electric reportable segment, see "business - our business - electric" in item 1 of part i of this report.
•the natural gas reportable segment includes natural gas distribution services that are subject to rate regulation in centerpoint energy's and cerc's service territories, as well as home appliance maintenance and repair services to customers in minnesota and home repair protection plans to natural gas customers in arkansas, indiana, mississippi, ohio, oklahoma and texas through a third party as of december 31, 2021. for further information about the natural gas reportable segment, see "business - our business - natural gas" in item 1 of part i of this report.
centerpoint energy's corporate and other includes office buildings and other real estate used for business operations, energy performance contracting and sustainable infrastructure services and other corporate support operations.
houston electric and cerc each consist of a single reportable segment.
executive summary we expect our businesses to continue to be affected by the key factors and trends discussed below. our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. to the extent our underlying assumptions about, or interpretations of, available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.
factors influencing our businesses and industry trends we are an energy delivery company. the majority of our revenues are generated from the transmission and delivery of electricity and the sale of natural gas by our subsidiaries.
as announced in december 2020, our business strategy incorporated the business review and evaluation committee's recommendations to increase our planned capital expenditures in our electric and natural gas businesses to support rate base growth and sell certain of our natural gas businesses located in arkansas and oklahoma as a means to efficiently finance a portion of such increased capital expenditures. the sale of our natural gas businesses in arkansas and oklahoma was completed in january 2022. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
in february 2021, we announced our support for the enable merger, which closed in december 2021. at our september 2021 analyst day, we announced our plans to exit the midstream sector by the end of 2022 and become a pure-play utility focusing on growth in our existing service territories. in september 2021, we entered into a forward sale agreement to sell 50 million energy transfer common units immediately following the closing of the enable merger. in december 2021, we completed sales of 150 million energy transfer common units (inclusive of the energy transfer common units sold pursuant to the forward sale agreement) and 192,390 energy transfer series g preferred units for net proceeds of $1,320 million. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
the regulation of natural gas pipelines and related facilities by federal and state regulatory agencies affects centerpoint energy's and cerc's businesses. in accordance with natural gas pipeline safety and integrity regulations, centerpoint energy and cerc are making, and will continue to make, significant capital investments in their service territories, which are necessary to help operate and maintain a safe, reliable and growing natural gas system. centerpoint energy's and cerc's compliance expenses may also increase as a result of preventative measures required under these regulations. consequently, new rates in the areas they serve are necessary to recover these increasing costs.
to assess our financial performance, our management primarily monitors recovery of costs and return on investments by the evaluation of net income and cash flows, among other things, from our regulated service territories within our reportable segments. within these broader financial measures, we monitor margins, natural gas and fuel costs, interest expense, capital spending working capital requirements, and operation and maintenance expense. in addition to these financial measures, we also monitor a number of variables that management considers important to gauge the performance of our reportable segments, including the number of customers, throughput, use per customer, commodity prices, heating and cooling degree days, environmental impacts, safety factors, system reliability and customer satisfaction.
the nature of our businesses requires significant amounts of capital investment, particularly in light of our new 10-year capital plan, and we rely on internally generated cash, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from commercial paper and issuances of debt and equity in the capital markets to satisfy these capital needs. proceeds from future dispositions of energy transfer common units or energy transfer series g preferred units could reduce borrowings or provide additional support for our capital investment needs. with respect to cerc, we intend to use proceeds from the completed dispositions of our natural gas businesses in arkansas and oklahoma and any potential further asset sales to satisfy a portion of its capital needs. we strive to maintain investment grade ratings for our securities to access the capital markets on terms we consider reasonable. a reduction in our ratings generally would increase our borrowing costs for new issuances of debt, as well as borrowing costs under our existing revolving credit facilities, and may prevent us from accessing the commercial paper markets. disruptions in the financial markets can also affect the availability of new capital on terms we consider attractive. in those circumstances, we may not be able to obtain certain types of external financing or may be required to accept terms less favorable than they would otherwise accept. for that reason, we seek to maintain adequate liquidity for our businesses through existing credit facilities and prudent refinancing of existing debt.
to the extent adverse economic conditions, including supply chain disruptions, affect our suppliers and customers, results from our energy delivery businesses may suffer. each state has a unique economy and is driven by different industrial sectors. our largest customers reflect the diversity in industries in the states across our footprint. for example, houston electric is largely concentrated in houston, texas, a diverse economy where a higher percentage of employment is tied to the energy sector relative to other regions of the country. although the houston area represents a large part of our customer base, we have a diverse customer base throughout the various states our utility businesses serve. in minnesota, for instance, education and health services are the state's largest sectors. indiana and ohio are impacted by changes in the midwest economy in general and changes in particular industries concentrated in the midwest such as automotive, feed and grain processing. some industries are driven by population growth like education and health care, while others may be influenced by strength in the national or international economy.
further, the global supply chain has experienced significant disruptions due to a multitude of factors, such as labor shortages, resource availability, long lead times, inflation and weather. these disruptions have adversely impacted the utility industry. like many of our peers, we have experienced disruptions to our supply chain and may continue to experience such disruptions in the future. for example, we, along with the developer of the project, recently announced plans to downsize the solar array to be built in posey county, indiana from 300 mw to 200 mw due to supply chain issues experienced in the energy industry, rising cost of commodities and community feedback. for more information, see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
also, adverse economic conditions, coupled with concerns for protecting the environment and increased availability of alternate energy sources, may cause consumers to use less energy or avoid expansions of their facilities, including natural gas facilities, resulting in less demand for our services. long-term national trends indicate customers have reduced their energy consumption, which could adversely affect our results. however, due to more affordable energy prices and continued economic improvement in the areas we serve, the trend toward lower usage has slowed. to the extent population growth is affected by lower energy prices and there is financial pressure on some of our customers who operate within the energy industry, there may be an impact on the growth rate of our customer base and overall demand. lower interest rates have helped single family housing starts in the houston and minneapolis to exceed growth in previous years. multifamily residential customer growth is affected by the cyclical nature of apartment construction. a new construction cycle in houston helped overall residential customer growth to surpass the long-term trend of 2% for the last two years. management expects residential meter growth for houston electric to remain in line with long term trends at approximately 2%. typical customer growth in the jurisdictions served by the natural gas reportable segment is approximately 1%. management expects residential meter growth for cerc to remain in line with long term trends at approximately 1%.
significant events sale of natural gas businesses. on april 29, 2021, centerpoint energy, through its subsidiary cerc corp., entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell its arkansas and oklahoma natural gas businesses for $2.15 billion in cash, including recovery of approximately $425 million in gas cost, including storm-related incremental natural gas costs incurred in the february 2021 winter storm event, subject to certain adjustments set forth in the asset purchase agreement. the sale closed on january 10, 2022. on august 31, 2021, centerpoint energy, through its subsidiary cerc corp., completed the sale of mes to last mile energy. for further information, see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
net zero emission goals. in september 2021, centerpoint energy announced new net zero emission goals for both scope 1 and certain scope 2 emissions by 2035 as well as a goal to reduce certain scope 3 emissions by 20% to 30% by 2035. for more information regarding centerpoint energy's new net zero emission goals and the risks associated with them, see "risk factors - risk factors affecting our businesses - centerpoint energy is subject to operational and financial risks..." and "management's discussion and analysis - liquidity and capital resources" in this form 10-k.
february 2021 winter storm event. in february 2021, portions of the united states experienced an extreme and unprecedented winter weather event that resulted in corresponding electricity generation shortages, including in texas, natural gas shortages and increased wholesale prices of natural gas in the united states. many customers of houston electric's reps and, to a lesser extent, of cerc, were severely impacted by outages in electricity and natural gas delivery during the february 2021 winter storm event. as a result of this weather event, the governors of texas, oklahoma and louisiana declared states of either disaster or emergencies in their respective states. subsequently, president biden also approved major disaster declarations for all or parts of texas, oklahoma and louisiana.
the february 2021 winter storm event resulted in financial impacts to centerpoint energy, houston electric and cerc, including substantial increases in prices for natural gas, decreased revenues at houston electric due to ercot-mandated outages, additional interest expense related to external financing to pay for natural gas working capital, significant impacts to the reps, including the reps' ability to pay invoices from houston electric, increases in bad debt expense, issues with counterparties and customers, litigation and investigations or inquiries from government or regulatory agencies and entities, and other financial impacts. centerpoint energy does not, at this time, anticipate long-term financial impacts associated with the february 2021 winter storm event, including changes to its credit profile, credit ratings or liquidity, given the regulatory mechanisms that are in place in our jurisdictions to recover the extraordinary expenses. centerpoint energy is, however, continuing to work with individual regulatory agencies to reach a successful final resolution on the recovery of the extraordinary costs. for more information regarding regulatory impacts, debt transactions and litigation, see notes 7, 14 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements and "-liquidity and capital resources -future sources and uses of cash" and "-regulatory matters" below.
enable merger agreement. on february 16, 2021, enable entered into the enable merger agreement. on december 2, 2021, the enable merger closed pursuant to the enable merger agreement. at the closing of the enable merger, centerpoint energy transferred 100% of the enable common units and enable series a preferred units it owned in exchange for energy transfer common units and energy transfer series g preferred units, respectively. in december 2021, we completed sales of approximately 75% of the acquired energy transfer common units and 50% of energy transfer series g preferred units for net proceeds of $1,320 million. for more information, see notes 4, 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
debt transactions. in 2021, centerpoint energy, houston electric and cerc issued a combined $4.5 billion in new debt and repaid or redeemed a combined $2.7 billion of debt, excluding scheduled principal payments on securitization bonds. additionally, on january 31, 2022, cerc corp. redeemed $425 million aggregate principal amount of cerc's outstanding senior notes due 2023. for further information about debt transactions in 2021 and to date in 2022, see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
preferred stock conversions. for information regarding preferred stock conversions in 2021, see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.
regulatory proceedings. for information related to our pending and completed regulatory proceedings in 2021 and to date in 2022, see "-liquidity and capital resources -regulatory matters" below.
board of directors governance structure. on july 22, 2021, centerpoint energy announced the decision of the independent directors of the board to implement a new independent board leadership and governance structure and appointed a new independent chair of the board. to implement this new governance structure, the independent directors of the board eliminated the executive chairman position. for further information, see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

2021 compared to 2020
net income.  centerpoint energy reported income available to common shareholders of $1,391 million for 2021 compared to a loss available to common shareholders of $949 million for 2020.
the increase in income available to common shareholders of $2,340 million was primarily due to the following key factors:
•an increase in earnings from discontinued operations primarily related to the enable merger discussed further in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements and the 2020 impairment in enable discussed further in notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements;
•goodwill impairment at indiana electric in 2020;
•the dividend requirement and amortization of beneficial conversion feature associated with series c preferred stock in 2020; and
•favorable income tax impacts in 2021, partially offset by the cares act in 2020.
these increases were partially offset by:
•losses on the sale of energy transfer common units and energy transfer series g preferred units in 2021;
•make-whole premiums on debt redeemed in 2021; and
•the impact of the board-implemented governance changes announced in july 2021.
excluding those items, income available to common shareholders increased $191 million primarily due to the following key factors:
•rate relief, net of increases in depreciation and amortization and taxes other than income taxes;
•reduced impact of covid-19;
•continued customer growth; and
•reduced interest expense.
2020 compared to 2019
net income.  centerpoint energy reported a loss available to common shareholders of $949 million for 2020 compared to income available to common shareholders of $674 million for 2019.
the decrease in income available to common shareholders of $1,623 million was primarily due to the following key factors:
•a decrease in earnings from discontinued operations as a result of the 2020 impairment in enable discussed further in note 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements;
•goodwill impairment at indiana electric in 2020; and
•the dividend requirement and amortization of beneficial conversion feature associated with series c preferred stock in 2020
these decreases were partially offset by the cares act in 2020.
excluding those items, income available to common shareholders increased $115 million primarily due to the following key factors:
•rate relief, net of increases in depreciation and amortization and taxes other than income taxes;
•continued customer growth;
•operation and maintenance expense discipline; and
•the impact of twelve months in 2020 versus eleven months in 2019 for businesses acquired in the merger.
these increases were partially offset by the impact of covid-19.
discontinued operations. in september 2021, centerpoint energy's equity investment in enable met the held for sale criteria. on december 2, 2021, enable completed the previously announced enable merger pursuant to the enable merger agreement entered into on february 16, 2021. centerpoint energy's plan to exit its midstream investment reportable segment in 2022 represents a strategic shift to centerpoint energy. therefore, the assets and liabilities associated with the equity investment in enable are reflected as discontinued operations on centerpoint energy's statements of consolidated income, and the december 31, 2020 consolidated balance sheet was required to be recast for assets held for sale. for further information, see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
on february 3, 2020, centerpoint energy, through its subsidiary vusi, entered into the securities purchase agreement to sell the infrastructure services disposal group. accordingly, the previously reported infrastructure services reportable segment has been eliminated. the transaction closed on april 9, 2020. for further information, see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
additionally, on february 24, 2020, centerpoint energy, through its subsidiary cerc corp., entered into the equity purchase agreement to sell the energy services disposal group. accordingly, the previously reported energy services reportable segment has been eliminated. the transaction closed on june 1, 2020. for further information, see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
income tax expense. for a discussion of effective tax rate per period, see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
centerpoint energy's results of operations by reportable segment centerpoint energy's codm views net income as the measure of profit or loss for the reportable segments. segment results include inter-segment interest income and expense, which may result in inter-segment profit and loss.
the following discussion of results of operations by reportable segment concentrates on centerpoint energy's utility operations, conducted through two reportable segments, electric and natural gas. centerpoint energy's formerly reported midstream investments reportable segment results are now included in discontinued operations. for additional information regarding the midstream investments reportable segment, see notes 4, 10, 11 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements.

february 2021 winter storm event. in february 2021, portions of the united states experienced an extreme and unprecedented winter weather event resulting in corresponding electricity generation shortages, including in texas, and natural gas shortages and increased prices of natural gas in the united states. although centerpoint energy's and cerc's extraordinary costs from the increase in natural gas prices are subject to available natural gas cost recovery mechanisms in their jurisdictions (although timing of recovery is uncertain), until such amounts are ultimately recovered from customers, centerpoint energy and cerc will continue to incur increased finance-related costs, resulting in a significant use of cash. see "- regulatory matters - february 2021 winter storm event" below and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
off-balance sheet arrangements. other than houston electric's general mortgage bonds issued as collateral for tax-exempt long-term debt of centerpoint energy (see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements) and short-term leases, the registrants have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

•senate bill 2 reforms the ercot board to be comprised of a total of eleven directors: three ex officio representatives, and eight members who are unaffiliated with any market participants. the three ex officio directors-the ercot ceo, the public counsel of the office of public utility counsel, and the puct chair-serve on the board by virtue of their official position for as long as they hold that position. two members are non-voting directors: the ercot ceo and the puct chair. the other nine members are voting directors. the ercot board is currently comprised of the following members: mr. paul foster (chairman of ercot board), mr. william flores (vice chairman of ercot board), mr. carlos aguilar, mr. zin smati, mr. john swainson, mr. robert flexon, ms. julie england, ms. peggy heeg, mr. peter lake (puct chairman), mr. brad jones (ercot interim president & ceo), and mr. chris ekoh (public counsel of the office of public utility counsel).
•senate bill 3 establishes weatherization and other power grid requirements including the design and operation of a load management program for nonresidential customers during an energy emergency activation level 2 or higher event and the ability to recover the reasonable and necessary costs of the program.
•senate bill 415 allows a tdu to seek prior puct approval to contract with a power generation company for a puct assigned proportional share of electric energy storage system at the distribution level and recover certain costs and a reasonable return on contract payments if contract terms satisfy relevant accounting standards for a capital lease or finance lease.
•house bill 2483 allows a tdu to procure, own and operate, or jointly own with another tdu, transmission and distribution facilities with a lead time of at least six months that would aid in restoring power to the utility's distribution customers following a widespread outage, excluding storage equipment or facilities. reasonable and necessary costs can be recovered using the rate of return on investment from the most recent base rate proceeding. recovery of incremental operation and maintenance expenses and any return not recovered in a rate proceeding can be deferred until a future ratemaking proceeding. additionally, a tdu may lease and operate facilities that provide temporary emergency electric energy to aid in restoring power to the utility's distribution customers during a widespread power outage. leasing and operating costs can be recovered using the utility's rate of return from the most recent base rate proceeding and incremental operation and maintenance expenses can be deferred. the lease must be treated as a capital lease or finance lease for ratemaking purposes.
•senate bill 1281 removes the requirement for an electric utility to amend its ccn to construct a transmission line that connects existing transmission facilities to a substation or metering point if certain conditions are met and adds a customer benefit test into consideration. the bill also requires ercot to conduct biennial assessments of grid reliability in extreme weather scenarios.
houston electric continues to review the effects of the legislation and is working with the puct regarding proposed rulemakings and pursuing implementation of these items where applicable. for example, in 2021 houston electric entered into two leases for mobile generation: (1) a temporary short-term lease initially for 125 mw that expanded to 220 mw by december 31, 2021 and (2) a 7.5 year lease for up to 505 mw of mobile generation of which 125 mw was delivered as of december 31, 2021. as of december 31, 2021, centerpoint energy and houston electric intends to seek recovery in its dcrf of deferred costs and the applicable return under these lease agreements, approximating $200 million. these mobile generation leases will support resiliency in major weather events and were deployed during the restoration process for hurricane nicholas. see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.
in addition to these measures taken by houston electric to support system preparedness and reliability, the city of houston recently launched the first-of-its-kind long-term strategic power resilience initiative called "resilient now." in a joint effort, houston electric is working with the city of houston to develop the master energy plan for the city to help the community thrive through economic changes, digital transformation, and advancing environmental goals for the benefit of its communities. the master energy plan could develop into capital opportunities for houston electric, including relating to infrastructure modernization, residential weatherization, and investments around electric vehicles infrastructure.
minnesota base rate cases (centerpoint energy and cerc)
on october 28, 2019, cerc filed a general rate case with the mpuc seeking approval for a revenue increase of approximately $62 million with a projected test year ended december 31, 2020. the revenue increase is based upon a requested roe of 10.15% and an overall after-tax rate of return of 7.41% on a total rate base of approximately $1,307 million. cerc implemented interim rates reflecting $53 million for natural gas used on and after january 1, 2020. in september 2020, a settlement that addressed all issues except the inclusive financing/tob financing proposal by the city of minneapolis was signed by a majority of all parties and was filed with the office of administrative hearings. a stipulation between the city of minneapolis and cerc addressing the tob proposal was filed on september 2, 2020. the settlement reflects a $39 million increase and was based on an overall after-tax rate of return of 6.86% and does not specify individual cost of capital components. on march 1, 2021, the mpuc issued a written final order approving the $39 million increase and rejected the tob stipulation. the order also required cerc and the city of minneapolis to submit a future filing to allow for further development of a potential tob pilot program and additional or expanded low-income conservation improvement programs. a compliance filing was submitted on march 12, 2021 proposing a final rate implementation on june 1, 2021 and the interim refund occurring in june 2021, contingent on final mpuc approval. pursuant to mpuc approval, final rates were implemented on june 1, 2021 and the interim rate refunds were applied to customer accounts starting on june 12, 2021.
on november 1, 2021, cerc filed a general rate case with the mpuc seeking approval for a revenue increase of approximately $67 million with a projected test year ended december 31, 2022. the revenue increase is based upon a requested roe of 10.2% and an overall rate of return of 7.06% on a total rate base of approximately $1.8 billion. cerc requested that an interim rate increase of approximately $52 million be implemented january 1, 2022 while the rate case is litigated. an alternative request was also filed on november 1, 2021. the alternative request proposed a final rate increase of $40 million that would be implemented in the rate case on january 1, 2022, and offered: an increase in rates for plant investment only using the overall rate of return approved in the prior rate case, an asymmetrical capital true-up, extension of the recovery of gas costs incurred to serve customers in february 2021 from the then current 27 month mechanism to 63 months, an income tax rider, continuation of the existing property tax rider and continued deferral of covid-19 incremental costs along with additional adjustments. on december 30, 2021, the mpuc issued a written order denying the alternative request but extended the amortization period for extraordinary gas costs to 63-months beginning on january 1, 2022. the mpuc also issued written orders on the general rate case filing which (1) accepted cerc's rate-increase application with a time for final determination of september 1, 2022, (2) authorized the implementation of interim rates on january 1, 2022, of $42 million based on an overall rate of return of 6.46%, and (3) referred the case to the office of administrative hearings for a contested case proceeding. a procedural schedule has been set with intervenor testimony that was due on february 7, 2022, rebuttal testimony due on march 7, 2022, surrebuttal testimony due march 30, 2022, a hearing scheduled april 6, 2022 through april 8, 2022, the administrative law judge to issue a report on july 12, 2022 and the mpuc to issue an order in october 2022.
minnesota legislation (centerpoint energy and cerc)
the natural gas innovation act was passed by the minnesota legislature in june 2021 with bipartisan support. this law establishes a regulatory framework to enable the state's investor-owned natural gas utilities to provide customers with access to renewable energy resources and innovative technologies, with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and advancing the state's clean energy future. specifically, the natural gas innovation act allows a natural gas utility to submit an innovation plan for approval by the mpuc which could propose the use of renewable energy resources and innovative technologies such as:
•renewable natural gas (produces energy from organic materials such as wastewater, agricultural manure, food waste, agricultural or forest waste);
•renewable hydrogen gas (produces energy from water through electrolysis with renewable electricity such as solar);
•energy efficiency measures (avoids energy consumption in excess of the utility's existing conservation programs); and
•innovative technologies (reduces or avoids greenhouse gas emissions using technologies such as carbon capture).
cerc expects to submit its first innovation plan to the mpuc in 2022. the maximum allowable cost for an innovation plan will start at 1.75% of the utility's revenue in the state and could increase to 4% by 2033, subject to review and approval by the mpuc.

greenhouse gas regulation and compliance (centerpoint energy)
on august 3, 2015, the epa released its cpp rule, which required a 32% reduction in carbon emissions from 2005 levels. the final rule was published in the federal register on october 23, 2015, and that action was immediately followed by litigation ultimately resulting in the u.s. supreme court staying implementation of the rule. on july 8, 2019, the epa published the ace rule, which (i) repealed the cpp rule; (ii) replaced the cpp rule with a program that requires states to implement a program of energy efficiency improvement targets for individual coal-fired electric generating units; and (iii) amended the implementing regulations for section 111(d) of the clean air act. on january 19, 2021, the majority of the ace rule - including the cpp repeal, cpp replacement, and the timing-related portions of the section 111(d) implementing rule - was struck down by the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit and on october 29, 2021, the u.s. supreme court agreed to consider four petitions filed by various coal interests and a coalition of 19 states that seek review of the lower court's decision vacating the ace rule. centerpoint energy is currently unable to predict what a replacement rule for either the ace rule or cpp would require.
the biden administration recommitted the united states to the paris agreement, which can be expected to drive a renewed regulatory push to require further ghg emission reductions from the energy sector and proceeded to lead negotiations at the global climate conference in glasgow, scotland. on april 22, 2021, president biden announced new goals of 50% reduction of economy-wide ghg emissions, and 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035, which formed the basis of the us commitments announced in glasgow. in september 2021, centerpoint energy announced its new net zero emissions goals for both scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 2035 as well as a goal to reduce scope 3 emissions by 20% to 30% by 2035. because texas is an unregulated market, centerpoint energy's scope 2 estimates do not take into account texas electric transmission and distribution assets in the line loss calculation and exclude emissions related to purchased power in indiana between 2024 and 2026 as estimated. centerpoint energy's scope 3 estimates do not take into account the emissions of transport customers and emissions related to upstream extraction. these emission goals are expected to be used to position centerpoint energy to comply with anticipated future regulatory requirements from the current and future administrations to further reduce ghg emissions. centerpoint energy's and cerc's revenues, operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of their operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas. for more information regarding centerpoint energy's new net zero emission goals and the risks associated with them, see "risk factors - risk factors affecting our businesses - centerpoint energy is subject to operational and financial risks..." in addition, the epa has indicated that it intends to implement new regulations targeting reductions in methane emissions, which are likely to increase costs related to production, transmission and storage of natural gas. houston electric, in contrast to some electric utilities including indiana electric, does not generate electricity, other than leasing facilities that provide temporary emergency electric energy to aid in restoring power to distribution customers during certain widespread power outages as allowed by a new law enacted after the february 2021 winter storm event, and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity. centerpoint energy's new net zero emissions goals are aligned with indiana electric's generation transition plan and are expected to position indiana electric to comply with anticipated future regulatory requirements related to ghg emissions reductions. nevertheless, houston electric's and indiana electric's revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within their respective service territories. likewise, incentives to conserve energy or to use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for the registrants' services. for example, minnesota has enacted the natural gas innovation act that seeks to provide customers with access to renewable energy resources and innovative technologies, with the goal of reducing ghg emissions. further, certain local government bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain specified dates. for example, minneapolis has adopted carbon emission reduction goals in an effort to decrease reliance on fossil gas. additionally, cities in minnesota within centerpoint energy's natural gas operational footprint are considering initiatives to eliminate natural gas use in buildings and focus on electrification. also, minnesota cities may consider seeking legislative authority for the ability to enact voluntary enhanced energy standards for all development projects. these initiatives could have a significant impact on centerpoint energy and its operations, and this impact could increase if other cities and jurisdictions in its service area enact similar initiatives. further, our third party suppliers, vendors and partners may also be impacted by climate change laws and regulations, which could impact centerpoint energy's business by, among other things, causing permitting and construction delays, project cancellations or increased project costs passed on to centerpoint energy. conversely, regulatory actions that effectively promote the consumption of natural gas because of its lower emissions characteristics would be expected to benefit centerpoint energy and cerc and their natural gas-related businesses. at this time, however, we cannot quantify the magnitude of the impacts from possible new regulatory actions related to ghg emissions, either positive or negative, on the registrants' businesses.
compliance costs and other effects associated with climate change, reductions in ghg emissions and obtaining renewable energy sources remain uncertain. although the amount of compliance costs remains uncertain, any new regulation or legislation relating to climate change will likely result in an increase in compliance costs. while the requirements of a federal or state rule remain uncertain, centerpoint energy will continue to monitor regulatory activity regarding ghg emission standards that may affect its business. currently, centerpoint energy does not purchase carbon credits. in connection with its net zero emissions goals, centerpoint energy is expected to purchase carbon credits in the future; however, centerpoint energy does not currently expect the number of credits, or cost for those credits, to be material.
climate change trends and uncertainties as a result of increased awareness regarding climate change, coupled with adverse economic conditions, availability of alternative energy sources, including private solar, microturbines, fuel cells, energy-efficient buildings and energy storage devices, and new regulations restricting emissions, including potential regulations of methane emissions, some consumers and companies may use less energy, meet their own energy needs through alternative energy sources or avoid expansions of their facilities, including natural gas facilities, resulting in less demand for the registrants' services. as these technologies become a more cost-competitive option over time, whether through cost effectiveness or government incentives and subsidies, certain customers may choose to meet their own energy needs and subsequently decrease usage of the registrants' systems and services, which may result in, among other things, indiana electric's generating facilities becoming less competitive and economical. further, evolving investor sentiment related to the use of fossil fuels and initiatives to restrict continued production of fossil fuels have had significant impacts on centerpoint energy's electric generation and natural gas businesses. for example, because indiana electric's current generating facilities substantially rely on coal for their operations, certain financial institutions choose not to participate in centerpoint energy's financing arrangements. conversely, demand for the registrants' services may increase as a result of customer changes in response to climate change. for example, as the utilization of electric vehicles increases, demand for electricity may increase, resulting in increased usage of centerpoint energy's systems and services. any negative opinions with respect to centerpoint energy's environmental practices or its ability to meet the challenges posed by climate change formed by regulators, customers, investors, legislators or other stakeholders could harm its reputation.
to address these developments, centerpoint energy announced its new net zero emissions goals for both scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 2035. in june of 2020, indiana electric identified a preferred generation resource in its most recent irp submitted to the iurc that aligns with its new net zero emission goals and includes the replacement of 730 mw of coal-fired generation facilities with a significant portion comprised of renewables, including solar and wind, supported by dispatchable natural gas combustion turbines, including a pipeline to serve such natural gas generation, as well as storage. additionally, as reflected in its 10-year capital plan announced in september 2021, centerpoint energy anticipates spending over $3 billion in clean energy investments and enablement, which may be used to support, among other things, renewable energy generation and electric vehicle expansion. centerpoint energy believes its planned investments in renewable energy generation and corresponding planned reduction in its ghg emissions as part of its newly adopted net zero emissions goals support global efforts to reduce the impacts of climate change. for more information regarding centerpoint energy's new net zero emission goals and the risks associated with them, see "risk factors - risk factors affecting our businesses - centerpoint energy is subject to operational and financial risks..."
to the extent climate changes result in warmer temperatures in the registrants' service territories, financial results from the registrants' businesses could be adversely impacted. for example, centerpoint energy's and cerc's natural gas could be adversely affected through lower natural gas sales. on the other hand, warmer temperatures in centerpoint energy's and houston electric's electric service territory may increase revenues from transmission and distribution and generation through increased demand for electricity used for cooling. another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes and flooding, including such storms as the february 2021 winter storm event. since many of the registrants' facilities are located along or near the texas gulf coast, increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to customers. centerpoint energy's recently announced 10-year capital plan includes capital expenditures to maintain reliability and safety and increase resiliency of its systems as climate change may result in more frequent significant weather events. houston electric does not own or operate any electric generation facilities other than, since september 2021, leasing facilities that provide temporary emergency electric energy to aid in restoring power to distribution customers during certain widespread power outages as allowed by a new law enacted after the february 2021 winter storm event. houston electric transmits and distributes to customers of reps electric power that the reps obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties. to the extent adverse weather conditions affect the registrants' suppliers, results from their energy delivery businesses may suffer. for example, in texas, the february 2021 winter storm event caused an electricity generation shortage that was severely disruptive to houston electric's service territory and the wholesale generation market and also caused a reduction in available natural gas capacity. when the registrants cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers, or customers cannot receive services, the registrants' financial results can be impacted by lost revenues, and they generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs. to the extent the registrants are unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for services, the registrants' future financial results may be adversely impacted. further, as the intensity and frequency of significant weather events continues, it may impact our ability to secure cost-efficient insurance.
other matters credit facilities the registrants may draw on their respective revolving credit facilities from time to time to provide funds used for general corporate and limited liability company purposes, including to backstop centerpoint energy's and cerc's commercial paper programs. the facilities may also be utilized to obtain letters of credit. for further details related to the registrants' revolving credit facilities, please see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
based on the consolidated debt to capitalization covenant in the registrants' revolving credit facilities, the registrants would have been permitted to utilize the full capacity of such revolving credit facilities, which aggregated approximately $4 billion as of december 31, 2021.

(1)the credit facility was issued by vuhi and is guaranteed by sigeco, indiana gas and vedo.
borrowings under each of the revolving credit facilities are subject to customary terms and conditions. however, there is no requirement that the borrower makes representations prior to borrowing as to the absence of material adverse changes or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect. borrowings under each of the revolving credit facilities are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default that we consider customary. the revolving credit facilities also provide for customary fees, including commitment fees, administrative agent fees, fees in respect of letters of credit and other fees. in each of the revolving credit facilities, the spread to libor and the commitment fees fluctuate based on the borrower's credit rating. each of the registrant's credit facilities provide for a mechanism to replace libor with possible alternative benchmarks upon certain benchmark replacement events. the borrowers are currently in compliance with the various business and financial covenants in the four revolving credit facilities.
long-term debt for detailed information about the registrants' debt issuances in 2021, see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
securities registered with the sec on may 29, 2020, the registrants filed a joint shelf registration statement with the sec registering indeterminate principal amounts of houston electric's general mortgage bonds, cerc corp.'s senior debt securities and centerpoint energy's senior debt securities and junior subordinated debt securities and an indeterminate number of shares of common stock, shares of preferred stock, depositary shares, as well as stock purchase contracts and equity units. the joint shelf registration statement will expire on may 29, 2023. for information related to the registrants' debt and equity security issuances in 2021, see notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
temporary investments as of february 15, 2022, the registrants had no temporary investments.
money pool the registrants participate in a money pool through which they and certain of their subsidiaries can borrow or invest on a short-term basis. funding needs are aggregated and external borrowing or investing is based on the net cash position. the net funding requirements of the centerpoint energy money pool are expected to be met with borrowings under centerpoint energy's revolving credit facility or the sale of centerpoint energy's commercial paper. the net funding requirements of the cerc money pool are expected to be met with borrowings under cerc's revolving credit facility or the sale of cerc's commercial paper. the money pool may not provide sufficient funds to meet the registrants' cash needs.

(1)a moody's rating outlook is an opinion regarding the likely direction of an issuer's rating over the medium term.
(2)an s&p outlook assesses the potential direction of a long-term credit rating over the intermediate to longer term.
(3)a fitch rating outlook indicates the direction a rating is likely to move over a one- to two-year period.
the registrants cannot assure that the ratings set forth above will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. the registrants note that these credit ratings are included for informational purposes and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold the registrants' securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of the registrants' credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on the registrants' ability to obtain short- and long-term financing, the cost of such financings and the execution of the registrants' commercial strategies.
a decline in credit ratings could increase borrowing costs under the registrants' revolving credit facilities. if the registrants' credit ratings had been downgraded one notch by s&p and moody's from the ratings that existed as of december 31, 2021, the impact on the borrowing costs under the four revolving credit facilities would have been insignificant. a decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long-term debt to be issued in the capital markets and could negatively impact the registrants' ability to complete capital market transactions and to access the commercial paper market. additionally, a decline in credit ratings could increase cash collateral requirements and reduce earnings of centerpoint energy's and cerc's natural gas reportable segments.
pipeline tariffs and contracts typically provide that if the credit ratings of a shipper or the shipper's guarantor drop below a threshold level, which is generally investment grade ratings from both moody's and s&p, cash or other collateral may be demanded from the shipper in an amount equal to the sum of three months' charges for pipeline services plus the unrecouped cost of any lateral built for such shipper. if the credit ratings of cerc corp. decline below the applicable threshold levels, cerc might need to provide cash or other collateral of as much as $213 million as of december 31, 2021. the amount of collateral will depend on seasonal variations in transportation levels.
zens and securities related to zens (centerpoint energy)
if centerpoint energy's creditworthiness were to drop such that zens holders thought its liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the zens were to become illiquid, some zens holders might decide to exchange their zens for cash. funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of zens-related securities that centerpoint energy owns or from other sources. centerpoint energy owns shares of zens-related securities equal to approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate its obligation to the holders of the zens. zens exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the zens and shares of zens-related securities would typically cease when zens are exchanged or otherwise retired and shares of zens-related securities are sold. the ultimate tax liability related to the zens and zens-related securities continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year, and there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of the retirement or exchange of the zens. if all zens had been exchanged for cash on december 31, 2021, deferred taxes of approximately $539 million would have been payable in
2021. if all the zens-related securities had been sold on december 31, 2021, capital gains taxes of approximately $146 million would have been payable in 2021. for additional information about zens, see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
cross defaults under each of centerpoint energy's (including vuhi's), houston electric's and cerc's respective revolving credit facilities, a payment default on, or a non-payment default that permits acceleration of, any indebtedness for borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations (including guarantees) exceeding $125 million by the borrower or any of their respective significant subsidiaries will cause a default under such borrower's respective credit facility or term loan agreement. a default by centerpoint energy would not trigger a default under its subsidiaries' debt instruments or revolving credit facilities.
possible acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures from time to time, the registrants consider the acquisition or the disposition of assets or businesses or possible joint ventures, strategic initiatives or other joint ownership arrangements with respect to assets or businesses. any determination to take action in this regard will be based on market conditions and opportunities existing at the time, and accordingly, the timing, size or success of any efforts and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable. the registrants may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with proceeds from debt and/or equity issuances. debt or equity financing may not, however, be available to the registrants at that time due to a variety of events, including, among others, maintenance of our credit ratings, industry conditions, general economic conditions, market conditions and market perceptions. as announced in september 2021, centerpoint energy plans to increase its planned capital expenditures in its electric and natural gas businesses to support rate base growth and may explore asset sales in addition to the recently completed sale of its natural gas businesses located in arkansas and oklahoma as a means to efficiently finance a portion of such increased capital expenditures. on january 10, 2022, cerc corp. completed the sale of its arkansas and oklahoma regulated natural gas ldc businesses. for further information, see notes 4 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements.
on december 2, 2021, the enable merger closed and, as a result, centerpoint energy received energy transfer common units and energy transfer series g preferred units. subsequent to the closing of the enable merger, in december 2021, centerpoint energy sold 150 million of the energy transfer common units (inclusive of the energy transfer common units sold pursuant to the forward sale agreement) and half of the energy transfer series g preferred units it received in the enable merger. centerpoint energy has announced plans to dispose of all of its interests in energy transfer by the end of 2022.  centerpoint energy may not realize any or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational or other benefits from any disposition or reduction of its investment in energy transfer. there can be no assurances that any further disposal of energy transfer common units or energy transfer series g preferred units will be completed. any disposal of such securities may involve significant costs and expenses, including in connection with any public offering, a significant underwriting discount. for information regarding the enable merger, see notes 4, 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
hedging of interest expense for future debt issuances from time to time, the registrants may enter into interest rate agreements to hedge, in part, volatility in the u.s. treasury rates by reducing variability in cash flows related to interest payments. for further information, see note 9(a) to the consolidated financial statements.
weather hedge (centerpoint energy and cerc)
centerpoint energy and cerc have historically entered into partial weather hedges for certain natural gas jurisdictions and electric operations' texas service territory to mitigate the impact of fluctuations from normal weather. centerpoint energy and cerc remain exposed to some weather risk as a result of the partial hedges. centerpoint energy and cerc did not enter into any weather hedges during the year ended december 31, 2021. for more information about weather hedges, see note 9(a) to the consolidated financial statements.
collection of receivables from reps (centerpoint energy and houston electric)
houston electric's receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from reps that supply the electricity houston electric distributes to their customers. before conducting business, a rep must register with the puct and must meet certain financial qualifications. nevertheless, adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ercot or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for houston electric's services or could cause them to delay such payments. houston electric depends on these reps to remit payments on a timely basis, and any delay or default in payment by reps could adversely affect houston electric's cash flows. in the event of a rep's default, houston electric's tariff provides a number of remedies, including the option for houston electric to request that the puct suspend or revoke the certification of the rep. applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another rep or a provider of last resort if a rep cannot make timely payments. however, houston electric remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to the replacement rep or the provider of last resort. if a rep were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such rep might seek to avoid honoring its obligations and claims might be made against houston electric involving payments it had received from such rep. if a rep were to file for bankruptcy, houston electric may not be successful in recovering accrued receivables owed by such rep that are unpaid as of the date the rep filed for bankruptcy. however, puct regulations authorize utilities, such as houston electric, to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by reps for recovery in future rate cases, subject to a review of reasonableness and necessity.
other factors that could affect cash requirements in addition to the above factors, the registrants' liquidity and capital resources could also be negatively affected by:
•cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts, including weather hedging arrangements, and natural gas purchases, natural gas price and natural gas storage activities of centerpoint energy's and cerc's natural gas reportable segment;
•reductions in the cash distributions we receive from energy transfer;
•acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts, under certain circumstances, as a result of increased natural gas prices, and concentration of natural gas suppliers (centerpoint energy and cerc);
•increased costs related to the acquisition of natural gas (centerpoint energy and cerc);
•increases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings and borrowings under credit facilities or term loans or the use of alternative sources of financings due to the effects of covid-19 on capital and other financial markets;
•various legislative or regulatory actions;
•incremental collateral, if any, that may be required due to regulation of derivatives (centerpoint energy);
•the ability of reps, including rep affiliates of nrg and vistra energy corp., to satisfy their obligations to centerpoint energy and houston electric, including the negative impact on such ability related to covid-19 and the february 2021 winter storm event;
•slower customer payments and increased write-offs of receivables due to higher natural gas prices, changing economic conditions, covid-19 or the february 2021 winter storm event (centerpoint energy and cerc);
•the satisfaction of any obligations pursuant to guarantees;
•the outcome of litigation, including litigation related to the february 2021 winter storm event;
•contributions to pension and postretirement benefit plans;
•restoration costs and revenue losses resulting from future natural disasters such as hurricanes and the timing of recovery of such restoration costs; and
•various other risks identified in "risk factors" in item 1a of part i of this report.
certain contractual limits on our ability to issue securities and borrow money certain provisions in certain note purchase agreements relating to debt issued by vuhi have the effect of restricting the amount of additional first mortgage bonds issued by sigeco. additionally, such note purchase agreements would restrict the securitization (as enabled by senate bill 386 as enacted by the state of indiana) that centerpoint energy intends to seek in 2022 of remaining book value and removal costs associated with generating facilities to be retired by indiana electric. for information about the total debt to capitalization financial covenants in the registrants' and certain of centerpoint energy's subsidiaries' revolving credit facilities, see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of the registrants' financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates. an accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element, item or account in the financial statements. accounting estimates in the registrants' historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events, or the present status of an asset or liability. the accounting estimates described below require the registrants to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made. additionally, different estimates that the registrants could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of their financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. the circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty. the registrants base their estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments. these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the registrants' operating environment changes. the registrants' significant accounting policies are discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. the registrants believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates. accordingly, these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of centerpoint energy's board of directors.
accounting for rate regulation accounting guidance for regulated operations provides that rate-regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. centerpoint energy, for its electric and natural gas reportable segments, houston electric and cerc apply this accounting guidance. certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet as regulatory assets or liabilities and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded when it is probable that these items will be recovered or reflected in future rates. determining probability requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals. if events were to occur that would make the recovery of these assets and liabilities no longer probable, the registrants would be required to write off or write down these regulatory assets and liabilities. for further detail on the registrants' regulatory assets and liabilities, see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
impairment of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangibles, goodwill, and equity method investments the registrants review the carrying value of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangibles, goodwill, equity method investments, and investments without a readily determinable fair value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable, and at least annually, goodwill is tested for impairment as required by accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets. unforeseen events, changes in market conditions, and probable regulatory disallowances, where applicable, could have a material effect on the value of long-lived assets, including intangibles, goodwill, equity method investments, and investments without a readily determinable fair value due to changes in observable or estimated market value, future cash flows, interest rate, and regulatory matters could result in an impairment charge. the registrants recorded no impairments to long-lived assets, including intangibles, goodwill, or equity method investments during 2021 and 2019. during 2020, centerpoint energy recognized equity method investment impairment losses as discussed further in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements and goodwill impairment losses as discussed further in notes 6 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
fair value is the amount at which an asset, liability or business could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures. the fair value could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques.
fair value measurements require significant judgment and unobservable inputs, including (i) projected timing and amount of future cash flows, which factor in planned growth initiatives, (ii) the regulatory environment, as applicable, and (iii) discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future market prices. determining the discount rates for the non-rate regulated businesses requires the estimation of the appropriate company specific risk premiums for those non-rate regulated businesses based on evaluation of industry and entity-specific risks, which includes expectations about future market or economic conditions existing on the date of the impairment test. changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on results of the impairment tests.
annual goodwill impairment test centerpoint energy and cerc completed their 2021 annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2021 and determined, based on an income approach or a weighted combination of income and market approaches, that no goodwill impairment charge was required for any reporting unit. the fair values of each reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit.
although no goodwill impairment resulted from the 2021 annual test, an interim goodwill impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, if centerpoint energy's market capitalization falls below book value for an extended period of time, or events affecting a reporting unit such as a contemplated disposal of all or part of a reporting unit.
assets held for sale and discontinued operations generally, a long-lived asset to be sold is classified as held for sale in the period in which management, with approval from the board of directors, as applicable, commits to a plan to sell, and a sale is expected to be completed within one year. the registrants record assets and liabilities held for sale, or the disposal group, at the lower of their carrying value or their estimated fair value less cost to sell. if a disposal group reflects a component of a reporting unit and meets the definition of a business, the goodwill within that reporting unit is allocated to the disposal group based on the relative fair value of the components representing a business that will be retained and disposed. goodwill is not allocated to a portion of a reporting unit that does not meet the definition of a business. a disposal group that meets the held for sale criteria and also represents a strategic shift to the registrant is also reflected as discontinued operations on the statements of consolidated income, and prior periods are recast to reflect the earnings or losses from such businesses as income from discontinued operations, net of tax.
during the year ended december 31, 2021, as described further in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, certain assets and liabilities representing a business met the held for sale criteria. as a result, goodwill attributable to the natural gas reporting unit of $398 million and $144 million at centerpoint energy and cerc, respectively, was deemed attributable to assets held for sale as of december 31, 2021. neither centerpoint energy nor cerc recognized any gains or losses upon classification of held for sale, including impairments of goodwill, during the year ended december 31, 2021.
fair value is the amount at which an asset, liability or business could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including quoted market prices, present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures. the fair value could be different if different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques were applied.
fair value measurements require significant judgment and often unobservable inputs, including (i) projected timing and amount of future cash flows, which factor in planned growth initiatives, (ii) the regulatory environment, as applicable, and (iii) discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future market prices. changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the resulting fair value.
centerpoint energy and cerc used a market approach consisting of the contractual sales price adjusted for estimated working capital and other contractual purchase price adjustments to determine fair value of the businesses classified as held for sale. the fair value of the retained businesses within the natural gas reporting unit was estimated based on a weighted combination of income and market approaches, consistent with the methodology used in the 2021 and 2020 annual goodwill impairment tests. a third-party valuation specialist was utilized to determine the key assumptions used in the estimate of fair value of the retained natural gas reporting unit as of december 31, 2021. the fair value of the retained natural gas reporting unit at centerpoint energy and cerc significantly exceeded the carrying value of the retained businesses within that reporting unit immediately after classifying the arkansas and oklahoma natural gas businesses as held for sale.
for further information, see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
unbilled revenues revenues related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally recognized upon delivery to customers. however, the determination of deliveries to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month either electronically through ams meter communications or manual readings. at the end of each month, deliveries to non-ams customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated. information regarding deliveries to ams customers after the last billing is obtained from actual ams meter usage data. unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on actual ams meter data, daily supply volumes and applicable rates. unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes, estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect. as additional information becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised. consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.
pension and other retirement plans centerpoint energy sponsors pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements. centerpoint energy uses several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to its plans. these factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management, within certain guidelines. in addition, centerpoint energy's actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension and other retirement plans expense recorded. please read "- other significant matters - pension plans" for further discussion.
new accounting pronouncements see note 2(u) to the consolidated financial statements, incorporated herein by reference, for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect the registrants.
other significant matters pension plans (centerpoint energy).  as discussed in note 8(b) to the consolidated financial statements, centerpoint energy maintains non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees. employer contributions for the qualified plans are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under erisa and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes.
under the terms of centerpoint energy's pension plans, it reserves the right to change, modify or terminate the plan. centerpoint energy's funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under erisa.
additionally, centerpoint energy maintains unfunded non-qualified benefit restoration plans that allows participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under the non-contributory qualified pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated.
centerpoint energy's funding requirements and employer contributions for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:
year ended december 31,
2021                                                                                                       2020                    2019

minimum funding requirements for qualified pension plans                      $-                        $76                     $86
employer contributions to the qualified pension plans                         53                         76                      86
employer contributions to the non-qualified benefit restoration plans         8                          10                      23
although centerpoint energy's minimum contribution requirement to the qualified pension plans in 2022 is zero, it expects to make contributions aggregating up to $50 million. centerpoint energy expects to make contributions aggregating approximately $7 million to the non-qualified benefit restoration plans in 2022.
changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension expense in centerpoint energy's statements of consolidated income, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. as such, significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants.
as the sponsor of a plan, centerpoint energy is required to (a) recognize on its consolidated balance sheet an asset for the plan's over-funded status or a liability for the plan's under-funded status, (b) measure a plan's assets and obligations as of the end of the fiscal year and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of the plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income and, when related to its rate-regulated utilities with recoverability of cost, to regulatory assets.
the projected benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
as of december 31, 2021, the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets of centerpoint energy's pension plans by $226 million. changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plan during 2022 could materially, positively or negatively, change the funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions.
houston electric and cerc participate in centerpoint energy's qualified and non-qualified pension plans covering substantially all employees. pension cost by registrant were as follows:
year ended december 31,
2021                                                                                                  2020                                                                                      2019

(in millions)
pension cost         $69                                 $34                              $27                  $49                                 $19                              $20                  $93                                 $40                              $35
the calculation of pension cost and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions. changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate.
as of december 31, 2021, centerpoint energy's qualified pension plans had an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 5.00% rate, which is the same rate assumed as of december 31, 2020. the expected rate of return assumption was developed using the targeted asset allocation of our plans and the expected return for each asset class. centerpoint energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances plan assets to reduce volatility and better match plan assets and liabilities.
as of december 31, 2021, the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of 2.80%, which is 0.35% higher than the 2.45% discount rate assumed as of december 31, 2020. the discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high-quality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of centerpoint energy's plans.
centerpoint energy's actuarially determined pension and other postemployment cost for 2021 and 2020 that is greater or less than the amounts being recovered through rates in the majority of texas jurisdictions is deferred as a regulatory asset or liability, respectively.  pension cost for 2022, including the nonqualified benefit restoration plan, is estimated to be $22 million before applicable regulatory deferrals and capitalization, based on an expected return on plan assets of 5.00% and a discount rate of 2.80% as of december 31, 2021. if the expected return assumption were lowered by 0.50% from 5.00% to 4.50%, 2022 pension cost would increase by approximately $10 million.
as of december 31, 2021, the pension plans projected benefit obligation, including the unfunded nonqualified pension plans, exceeded plan assets by $226 million.  if the discount rate were lowered by 0.50% from 2.80% to 2.30%, the assumption change would increase centerpoint energy's projected benefit obligation by approximately $118 million and decrease its 2022 pension cost by approximately $5 million. the expected reduction in pension cost due to the decrease in discount rate is a result of the expected correlation between the reduced interest rate and appreciation of fixed income assets in pension plans with significantly more fixed income instruments than equity instruments. in addition, the assumption change would impact centerpoint energy's consolidated balance sheets by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of december 31, 2021 by $100 million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in 2021 of $14 million, net of tax of $4 million, due to the increase in the projected benefit obligation.
future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plans will impact centerpoint energy's future pension expense and liabilities. centerpoint energy cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future.

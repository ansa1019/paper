item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction borgwarner inc. and consolidated subsidiaries (the "company" or "borgwarner") is a global product leader in clean and efficient technology solutions for combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles. borgwarner's products help improve vehicle performance, propulsion efficiency, stability and air quality. these products are manufactured and sold worldwide, primarily to original equipment manufacturers ("oems") of light vehicles (passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles ("suvs"), vans and light trucks). the company's products are also sold to other oems of commercial vehicles (medium-duty trucks, heavy-duty trucks and buses) and off-highway vehicles (agricultural and construction machinery and marine applications). the company also manufactures and sells its products to certain tier one vehicle systems suppliers and into the aftermarket for light, commercial and off-highway vehicles. the company operates manufacturing facilities serving customers in europe, the americas and asia and is an original equipment supplier to nearly every major automotive oem in the world.
charging forward - electrification portfolio strategy in 2021, the company announced its strategy to aggressively grow its electrification portfolio over time through organic investments and technology-focused acquisitions, most recently through the 2021 acquisition of akasol ag ("akasol") as well as the 2020 purchase of delphi technologies plc ("delphi technologies"). the company believes it is well positioned for the industry's anticipated migration to electric vehicles. additionally, the company announced a plan to dispose of certain internal combustion assets, targeting dispositions of assets generating approximately $1 billion in annual revenue in the succeeding 12 to 18 months and approximately $3 to $4 billion in annual revenue by 2025. the company is targeting its revenue from products for pure electric vehicles to be over 25% of its total revenue by 2025 and approximately 45% of its total revenue by 2030.
acquisition of akasol ag on june 4, 2021, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, abba bidco ag ("abba bidco"), completed its voluntary public takeover offer for shares of akasol, resulting in ownership of 89% of akasol's outstanding shares. the company paid approximately €648 million ($788 million) to settle the offer from current cash balances, which included proceeds received from its public offering of 1.00% senior notes due 2031 completed on may 19, 2021. following the settlement of the offer, akasol became a consolidated majority-owned subsidiary of the company. the company also consolidated approximately €64 million ($77 million) of gross debt of akasol. subsequent to the completion of the voluntary public takeover offer, the company purchased additional shares of akasol for €28 million ($33 million) increasing its ownership to 93% as of december 31, 2021. the acquisition further strengthens borgwarner's commercial vehicle and industrial electrification capabilities, which positions the company to capitalize on what it believes to be a fast-growing battery module and pack market.
on august 2, 2021, the company initiated a merger squeeze out process under german law for the purpose of acquiring 100% of akasol. on december 17, 2021, the shareholders of akasol voted to mandatorily transfer to abba bidco. ag, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the company, each issued and outstanding share of akasol held by shareholders that did not tender their shares in the company's previously completed exchange offer for akasol shares (the "squeeze out"). in exchange for the akasol shares transferred in the squeeze out, the company will pay appropriate cash compensation, in the amount of €119.16 per share. on february 10, 2022, the company completed the registration of the squeeze out resulting in 100% ownership. the company expects to settle the squeeze out with akasol minority shareholders in the first quarter of 2022. refer to note 2, "acquisitions and dispositions," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information.
acquisition of delphi technologies plc on october 1, 2020, the company completed its acquisition of 100% of the outstanding ordinary shares of delphi technologies from its shareholders pursuant to the terms of the transaction agreement, dated january 28, 2020, as amended on may 6, 2020, by and between the company and delphi technologies. the acquisition has strengthened the company's electronics and power electronics products, strengthened its capabilities and scale, enhanced key combustion, commercial vehicle and aftermarket product offerings, and positioned the company for greater growth as electrified propulsion systems gain momentum.
refer to note 2, "acquisitions and dispositions," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information. results of operations for akasol and delphi technologies are included in the company's financial information following their respective dates of acquisition.
covid-19 pandemic and other supply disruptions throughout 2020, covid-19 materially impacted the company's business and results of operations. following the declaration of covid-19 as a global pandemic on march 11, 2020, government authorities around the world began to impose shelter-in-place orders and other restrictions. as a result, many oems began suspending manufacturing operations, particularly in north america and europe. this led to various temporary closures of, or reduced operations at, the company's manufacturing facilities, late in the first quarter of 2020 and throughout the second quarter of 2020. during the second half of 2020, as global management of covid-19 evolved and government restrictions were removed or lessened, production levels improved, and substantially all of the company's production facilities resumed closer to normal operations by the end of the third quarter of 2020.
during 2021, trailing impacts of the shutdowns and production declines related, in part, to covid-19 created supply constraints of certain components, particularly semiconductor chips. these supply constraints have had, and are expected to continue to have, significant impacts on global industry production levels. in addition, it is possible a resurgence of covid-19 could result in adverse impacts in the future. management cannot reasonably estimate the full impact the ongoing supply constraints or the covid-19 pandemic could have on the company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future.
bond offering on may 19, 2021, in anticipation of the acquisition of akasol and to refinance the company's €500 million 1.8% senior notes due in november 2022, the company issued €1.0 billion in 1.0% senior notes due may 2031. interest is payable annually in arrears on may 19 of each year. these senior notes are not guaranteed by any of the company's subsidiaries. on june 18, 2021, the company repaid its €500 million 1.8% senior notes due november 2022 and incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of $20 million, which is reflected in interest expense, net in the consolidated statement of operations.

consolidated review this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (management's discussion) analyzes the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of nisource and its subsidiaries. it also includes management's analysis of past financial results and potential factors that may affect future results, potential future risks and approaches that may be used to manage those risks.
management's discussion is designed to provide an understanding of our operations and financial performance and should be read in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
executive summary nisource is an energy holding company under the public utility holding company act of 2005 whose subsidiaries are fully regulated natural gas and electric utility companies serving customers in seven states. nisource generates substantially all of its operating income through these rate-regulated businesses which are summarized for financial reporting purposes into two primary reportable segments: gas distribution operations and electric operations.
refer to the business section under item 1 of this report and note 22, "segments of business," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our regulated utility business segments.
nisource's goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as it addresses changing customer conservation patterns, develops more contemporary pricing structures and embarks on long-term investment programs. these strategies are intended to improve reliability and safety, enhance customer services and reduce emissions while generating sustainable returns. additionally, nisource continues to pursue regulatory and legislative initiatives that will allow residential customers not currently on nisource's system to obtain gas service in a cost effective manner.
summary of consolidated financial results on a consolidated basis, nisource reported higher income from continuing operations of $328.1 million or $1.02 per basic share for the twelve months ended december 31, 2016 compared to $198.6 million or $0.63 per basic share for the same period in 2015. the increase in income from continuing operations during 2016 was due primarily to increased operating income, as discussed below, along with a $97.2 million loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt recorded as a result of the debt restructuring that occurred in 2015 as part of the separation.
for the twelve months ended december 31, 2016, nisource reported operating income of $858.2 million compared to $799.9 million for the same period in 2015. the higher operating income was primarily due to increased net revenues from regulatory and service programs and increased rates from incremental capital spend on electric transmission projects at nipsco, partially offset by lower net revenues due to warmer than normal weather. operating expenses increased due to higher outside service costs, primarily due to generation-related maintenance, increased depreciation expense, plant retirement costs and higher employee and administrative expenses, partially offset by decreased property taxes and lower environmental expenses.
these factors and other impacts to the financial results are discussed in more detail within the following discussions of "results of operations," "results and discussion of segment operations" and "liquidity and capital resources."

capital investment. in 2016, nisource invested approximately $1.5 billion in capital expenditures across its gas and electric utilities. these expenditures were primarily aimed at furthering the safety and reliability of our gas distribution system, construction of new electric transmission assets and maintaining nisource's existing electric generation fleet. nisource continues to execute on an estimated $30 billion in total projected long-term regulated utility infrastructure investments and expects to invest approximately $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in capital during 2017 to continue to modernize and improve its system across all seven states.
liquidity. nisource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short-term revolving credit facility, commercial paper program, accounts receivable securitization facilities, long-term debt agreements and nisource's ability to access the capital markets, there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2017 and beyond. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, nisource had approximately $683.7 million and $1,179.4 million, respectively, of net liquidity available, consisting of cash and available capacity under credit facilities.

•   in december 2016, nipsco announced plans to retire two coal-fired units at its bailly generation station earlier than previously estimated. this decision was based on an analysis of current economic and legislative conditions including the decreasing cost of natural gas relative to coal and the increased cost of compliance with current and future environmental regulations.

other income (deductions)
other income (deductions) in 2016 reduced income $348.0 million compared to a reduction of $460.0 million in 2015. this change is primarily due to a loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt of $97.2 million in 2015 and decreased interest expense of $30.7 million primarily resulting from maturities of long-term debt. these changes were partially offset by a 2016 charge resulting from a tax notice impacting nipsco's tuas. refer to note 18-e, "other matters," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on nipsco's tuas.
other income (deductions) in 2015 reduced income $460.0 million compared to a reduction of $366.1 million in 2014. the increase in deductions is primarily due to a loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt of $97.2 million.
income taxes refer to note 10, "income taxes," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on income taxes.
results and discussion of segment operations presentation of segment information nisource's operations are divided into two primary reportable segments: gas distribution operations and electric operations.

gas distribution operations (continued)
nisource analyzes its operating results using net revenues. net revenues are calculated as gross revenues less the associated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization). cost of sales at the gas distribution operations segment is principally comprised of the cost of natural gas used while providing transportation and distribution services to its customers.
nisource believes net revenues are a better measure to analyze profitability than gross revenues because the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross revenues.
comparability of line item operating results may also be impacted by regulatory, tax and depreciation trackers (other than those for cost of sales) that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expense. therefore, increases in these tracked operating expenses are offset by increases in net revenues and have essentially no impact on income from continuing operations.
2016 vs. 2015 operating income for 2016, gas distribution operations reported operating income of $574.0 million, an increase of $18.2 million from the comparable 2015 period.
net revenues for 2016 were $1,935.2 million, an increase of $21.6 million from the same period in 2015. the change in net revenues was primarily driven by:
•   new rates from base-rate proceedings and infrastructure replacement programs of $95.1 million.
•   the effects of increased customer count of $9.6 million.
partially offset by:
•   lower regulatory, tax and depreciation trackers, which are offset in expense, of $52.8 million.
•   the effects of warmer weather of $12.4 million.
•   decreased commercial, industrial and residential usage of $8.8 million.
•   lower forfeited discount and late payment collections of $3.9 million.
operating expenses were $3.4 million higher in 2016 compared to 2015. this change was primarily driven by:
•   increased employee and administrative expenses of $26.1 million.
•   higher depreciation of $19.8 million due to increased capital expenditures placed in service.
•   increased outside service costs of $13.4 million.
•   higher rental expense of $2.6 million.
partially offset by:
•   lower regulatory, tax and depreciation trackers, which are offset in net revenues, of $52.8 million.
•   decreased gross receipts taxes of $2.8 million.
2015 vs. 2014 operating income for 2015, gas distribution operations reported operating income of $555.8 million, an increase of $18.8 million from the comparable 2014 period.
net revenues for 2015 were $1,913.6 million, an increase of $82.4 million from the same period in 2014. the change in net revenues was primarily driven by:
•   new rates from base-rate proceedings and infrastructure replacement programs of $88.7 million.
•   increased rent billed to affiliates, offset in expense, of $8.4 million.
•   higher regulatory and tax trackers, which are offset in expense, of $7.5 million.
partially offset by:
•   the effects of warmer weather of $30.6 million.
operating expenses were $63.6 million higher in 2015 compared to 2014. this change was primarily driven by:
•   increased employee and administrative expenses of $16.3 million.

•   increased regulatory and tax trackers, which are offset in net revenues, of $7.5 million.
weather in general, nisource calculates the weather-related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. nisource's composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather-related dollar impact on the results of gas distribution operations. heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. when the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather-related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated nisource composite heating degree day comparison.
weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2016 was about 9% warmer than normal and about 6% warmer than 2015, decreasing net revenues $12.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 2015.
weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2015 was about 3% warmer than normal and about 12% warmer than 2014, decreasing net revenues $30.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 2014.
throughput total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31, 2016 were 971.7 mmdth, compared to 988.7 mmdth for 2015. this decrease is primarily attributable to warmer weather experienced in 2016 compared to 2015.
total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31, 2015 were 988.7 mmdth, compared to 1,042.5 mmdth for 2014. this decrease is primarily attributable to warmer weather and lower off-system sales opportunities experienced in 2015 compared to 2014.
economic conditions all nisource gas distribution operations companies have state-approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. gas costs are treated as pass-through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as under-recovered or over-recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings.
at nipsco, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over-recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. these amounts are primarily reflected in the "other" gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. the adjustments to other gross revenues for the twelve months ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were a revenue increase of $43.3 million, a revenue decrease of $68.0 million and a revenue increase of $34.2 million, respectively.
certain gas distribution operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third-party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. these programs serve to further reduce nisource's exposure to gas prices.

electric operations (continued)
nisource analyzes its operating results using net revenues. net revenues are calculated as gross revenues less the associated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization). cost of sales at the electric operations segment is principally comprised of the cost of coal, related handling costs, and natural gas purchased for the internal generation of electricity at nipsco and the cost of power purchased from third-party generators of electricity.
nisource believes net revenues are a better measure to analyze profitability than gross revenues because the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross revenues.
comparability of line item operating results may also be impacted by regulatory and depreciation trackers (other than those for cost of sales) that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expense. therefore, increases in these tracked operating expenses are offset by increases in net revenues and have essentially no impact on income from continuing operations.
2016 vs. 2015 operating income for 2016, electric operations reported operating income of $291.4 million, an increase of $27.0 million from the comparable 2015 period.
net revenues for 2016 were $1,166.6 million, an increase of $80.6 million from the same period in 2015. the change in net revenues was primarily driven by:
•   new rates from base-rate proceedings of $36.3 million.
•   increased regulatory and depreciation trackers, which are offset in expense, of $30.2 million.
•   increased rates from incremental capital spend on electric transmission projects of $17.8 million.
•   the effects of warmer weather of $15.6 million.
partially offset by:
•   the absence of regulatory-deferred miso cost amortization of $10.2 million.
•   increased fuel handling costs of $7.8 million.
operating expenses were $53.6 million higher in 2016 than 2015. this change was primarily driven by:
•   increased regulatory and depreciation trackers, which are offset in net revenues, of $30.2 million.
•   higher outside service costs of $24.4 million, primarily due to generation-related maintenance.
•   plant retirement costs of $22.1 million.
partially offset by:
•   lower environmental costs of $10.7 million.
•   decreased amortization expense of $9.6 million.
2015 vs. 2014 operating income for 2015, electric operations reported operating income of $264.4 million, a decrease of $18.3 million from the comparable 2014 period.
net revenues for 2015 were $1,086.0 million, an increase of $22.3 million from the same period in 2014. the change in net revenues was primarily driven by:
•   higher regulatory and depreciation trackers, which are offset in expense, of $19.8 million.
•   increased rates from incremental capital spend on electric transmission projects and environmental investments of $19.1 million.
partially offset by:
•   lower industrial usage of $13.8 million.

operating expenses were $40.6 million higher in 2015 compared to 2014. this change was primarily driven by:
•   higher regulatory and depreciation trackers, which are offset in net revenues, of $19.8 million.
•   increased depreciation of $10.6 million.
•   higher environmental costs of $10.4 million.
weather in general, nisource calculates the weather-related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal cooling degree days. nisource's composite cooling degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather-related dollar impact on the results of electric operations. cooling degree days experienced during different times of the year may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when they occur. when the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather-related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated nisource composite cooling degree day comparison.
weather in the electric operations' territories for the twelve months ended december 31, 2016 was 23% warmer than normal and 30% warmer than the same period in 2015, leading to an increase in net revenues of approximately $15.6 million for the twelve months ended december 31, 2016 compared to 2015.
weather in the electric operations' territories for the twelve months ended december 31, 2015 was 5% cooler than normal and 15% warmer than the same period in 2014, increasing net revenues approximately $0.7 million for the twelve months ended december 31, 2015 compared to 2014.
sales electric operations sales were 16,831.2 gwh for the year ended 2016, an increase of 72.9 gwh compared to 2015, a 0.4% increase.
electric operations sales were 16,758.3 gwh for the year ended 2015, a decrease of 1,428.0 gwh compared to 2014. the 7.9% decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in industrial usage, which was caused by a reduction in steel production due to the high levels of imports that have impacted the domestic steel market since the start of 2015.
economic conditions nipsco has a state-approved recovery mechanism that provides a means for full recovery of prudently incurred fuel costs. fuel costs are treated as pass-through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. the fuel costs included in revenues are matched with the fuel cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as under-recovered or over-recovered fuel cost to be included in future customer billings.
at nipsco, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over-recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. these amounts are primarily reflected in the "other" gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. the adjustments to other gross revenues for the twelve months ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were a revenue increase of $33.1 million, and a revenue decrease of $11.6 million and $25.5 million, respectively.
nipsco's performance remains closely linked to the performance of the steel industry. nipsco's mwh sales to steel-related industries accounted for approximately 52.3% and 54.2% of the total industrial mwh sales for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
electric supply nipsco 2016 integrated resource plan. environmental, regulatory and economic factors, including low natural gas prices and aging coal-fired units, have led nipsco to consider modifying its current electric generation supply mix to include less coal-fired generation.  due to enacted ccr and elg legislation, nipsco would expect to incur over $1 billion in operating, maintenance, environmental and other costs over the next seven years if the current fleet of coal-fired generating units remain operational.
on november 1, 2016, nipsco submitted its 2016 integrated resource plan with the iurc. the plan evaluates demand-side and supply-side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet nipsco customers' future energy requirements over the next twenty years. the 2016 integrated resource plan indicates that the most viable option for customers and nipsco involves the retirement of bailly generating station (units 7 and 8) as soon as mid-2018 and two units (units 17 and 18) at the r.m. schahfer generating station by the end of 2023. it is projected over the long term that the cost to customers to retire these units at these dates will be lower than maintaining and upgrading them for continuing generation.

nisource and nipsco committed to the retirement of the bailly generating station units in connection with the filing of the 2016 integrated resource plan. however, retirement of these units is subject to the approval of the miso, which is responsible for coordinating, controlling and monitoring the use of the electric transmission system by utilities, generators and marketers across parts of 15 u.s. states and the canadian province of manitoba. in the fourth quarter of 2016, the miso approved nipsco's plan to retire the bailly generating station units by may 31, 2018.
in connection with the miso's approval of nipsco's planned retirement of the bailly generating station units, nisource recorded $22.1 million of plant retirement-related charges in the fourth quarter of 2016. these charges were comprised of contract termination charges related to nipsco's capital lease with pure air, voluntary employee severance benefits and write downs of certain materials and supplies inventory balances. refer to note 5, "property, plant and equipment," and note 18-e, "other matters," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information.

liquidity and capital resources operating activities net cash from operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $804.1 million, a decrease of $359.3 million from 2015. this decrease was driven by a combination of changes in weather, gas prices and the related approved rates for recovery, which significantly impacted regulatory assets, regulatory liabilities and working capital between the two periods. during 2015, natural gas prices were declining faster than the gas cost adjustments being collected from customers, resulting in an associated source of cash from working capital. during 2016, these over-collected gas costs from 2015 were returned to customers, resulting in a use of working capital.
net cash from operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2015 was $1,163.4 million, an increase of $402.2 million from 2014. the increase in net cash from operating activities from continuing operations was primarily due to the change in regulatory assets/liabilities, as well as the change in inventories as a result of lower gas prices and warmer weather in 2015 compared to 2014.
pension and other postretirement plan funding. in 2016, nisource contributed $3.3 million to its pension plans and $25.5 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. in 2017, nisource expects to make contributions of approximately $9.1 million to its pension plans and approximately $25.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. at december 31, 2016, nisource's pension and other postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by $414.9 million and $297.6 million, respectively.
income taxes. as of december 31, 2016, nisource has a recorded deferred tax asset of $600.9 million related to a federal nol carryforward. as a result of being in an nol position, nisource was not required to make any cash payments for federal income tax purposes during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015. this nol carryforward starts to expire in 2030, however nisource expects to fully utilize the carryforward benefit prior to its expiration.

(1) amounts differ from those presented on the statements of consolidated cash flows primarily due to the inclusion of capital expenditures included in current liabilities and afudc equity.
for 2017, nisource projects to invest approximately $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in its capital program. this projected increase over 2016 spend is driven by generation maintenance at the electric operations segment and additional system growth and tracker opportunities at the gas distribution operations and electric operations segments.
for 2016, the capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $1,490.4 million, which was $122.9 million higher than the 2015 capital program. this increased spending is mainly due to modernization projects and segment growth at the gas distribution operations segment.
for 2015, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $1,367.5 million, which is $27.9 million higher than the 2014 capital program. this increased spending is mainly due to increased tdsic spend in the gas distribution operations segment, partially offset by lower tracker program spend at the electric operations segment.

the change in net available liquidity between 2016 and 2015 was driven by low utilization of short-term debt in the prior year as a result of cash proceeds received from cpg in the separation in 2015.
debt covenants. nisource is subject to financial covenants under its revolving credit facility and term loan agreement, which require nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. a similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. as of december 31, 2016, the ratio was 66%.
sale of trade accounts receivables. refer to note 17, "transfers of financial assets," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable.
credit ratings. the credit rating agencies periodically review the company's ratings, taking into account factors such as its capital structure and earnings profile. in june 2016, moody's affirmed the nisource senior unsecured rating of baa2 and its commercial paper rating of p-2, with stable outlooks. moody's also affirmed nipsco's baa1 rating and columbia of massachusetts's baa2 rating, with stable outlooks. in august 2016, standard & poor's affirmed the bbb+ senior unsecured rating of nisource and its subsidiaries and its commercial paper rating of a-2, with stable outlooks. in june 2016, fitch upgraded the long-term issuer default ratings of nisource and nipsco to bbb and affirmed the commercial paper rating of f3, with stable outlooks.
certain nisource subsidiaries have agreements that contain "ratings triggers" that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of nisource or certain of its subsidiaries are below investment grade. these agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. as of december 31, 2016, the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $35.4 million. in addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain "adequate assurance" or "material adverse change" provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business.
equity. nisource has a shelf registration statement on file with the sec that authorizes nisource to issue an indeterminate amount of common stock and preferred stock, as well as other securities. the authorized capital stock of nisource consists of 420,000,000 shares, $0.01 par value, of which 400,000,000 are common stock and 20,000,000 are preferred stock. as of december 31, 2016, 323,159,672 shares of common stock were outstanding. nisource has no preferred stock outstanding as of december 31, 2016.

(1) long-term debt balance excludes unamortized issuance costs and discounts of $41.6 million.
(2) capital lease payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling $92.6 million.
(3) operating lease balances do not include amounts for fleet leases that can be renewed beyond the initial lease term. the company anticipates renewing the leases beyond the initial term, but the anticipated payments associated with the renewals do not meet the definition of expected minimum lease payments and therefore are not included above. expected payments are $31.1 million in 2017, $32.9 million in 2018, $26.1 million in 2019, $17.5 million in 2020, $8.0 million in 2021 and $2.0 million thereafter.
(4)in january 2017, nipsco signed new coal contract commitments of $24.2 million and $10.1 million for 2017 and 2018, respectively. these contracts are not included above.
nisource calculated estimated interest payments for long-term debt as follows: for the fixed-rate debt, interest is calculated based on the stated coupon and payment dates; for variable-rate debt, interest rates used are those that are in place as of december 31, 2016. for 2017, nisource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $356 million, which includes $337.9 million of interest payments related to its long-term debt outstanding as of december 31, 2016. at december 31, 2016, nisource also had $1,488.0 million in short-term borrowings outstanding.
nisource's expected payments included within "other liabilities" in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2017. plan contributions beyond 2017 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated at this time. in 2017, nisource expects to make contributions of approximately $9.1 million to its pension plans and approximately $25.3 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. refer to note 11, "pension and other postretirement benefits," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.
nisource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long-term obligations classified as "total other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, other than those described above.
nisource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $214.7 million in 2017, which are not included in the table above.
refer to note 18-a, "contractual obligations," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information.
off-balance sheet arrangements as a part of normal business, nisource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. such agreements include guarantees and stand-by letters of credit.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nisource inc.
market risk disclosures risk is an inherent part of nisource's businesses. the extent to which nisource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. nisource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal market risks that are involved in nisource's businesses: commodity price risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. risk management at nisource is a multi-faceted process with oversight by the risk management committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. nisource's senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. these may include but are not limited to market, operational, financial, compliance and strategic risk types. in recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, nisource's risk management process, policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification.
commodity price risk nisource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries' operations involving natural gas and power. to manage this market risk, nisource's subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps, forwards and options. nisource does not participate in speculative energy trading activity.
commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at nisource's rate-regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the ratemaking process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. if states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk.
nisource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. the amount of these deposits, which are reflected in nisource's restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets.
refer to note 9, "risk management activities," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on nisource's commodity price risk assets and liabilities as of december 31, 2016 and 2015.
interest rate risk nisource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short-term market interest rates. based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short-term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $11.7 million and $8.2 million for the years 2016 and 2015, respectively. nisource and its subsidiaries manage interest rate risk on long-term debt through forward starting interest rate swaps that hedge the interest rate risk related to forecasted issuances. nisource is also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in benchmark rates that can influence the interest rates of future debt issuances.
refer to note 9, "risk management activities," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on nisource's interest rate risk assets and liabilities as of december 31, 2016 and 2015.
credit risk due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of nisource's business activities. nisource's extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy. in addition, risk management committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. exposures to credit risks are monitored by the risk management function which is independent of commercial operations. credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. for derivative-related contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to nisource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash and letters of credit.
nisource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers. nisource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market-based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by major credit rating agencies.

fair value measurement nisource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. the level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. nisource's financial assets and liabilities include price risk management assets and liabilities and available-for-sale securities.
nisource's risk management assets and liabilities can generally be grouped into commodity purchase contracts, used to economically hedge against future changes in the price of coal or natural gas, and interest rate swaps, used to economically hedge against future changes in benchmark interest rates.
for commodity purchase contracts, exchange-traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within level 1. these financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. certain non-exchange-traded derivatives are valued using broker or over-the-counter, on-line exchanges. in such cases, these non-exchange-traded derivatives are classified within level 2. non-exchange-based derivative instruments may include futures, swaps, forwards, and options. in certain instances, nisource may utilize models to measure fair value. valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market-corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in level 2. certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. when such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in level 3. credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange-traded. credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures.
nisource's interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. each period the swap instruments will be measured assuming a hypothetical settlement at that point in time. upon termination of the swap instruments, nisource will pay or receive a settlement based on the current market value. credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of each interest rate swap. as they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
available-for-sale securities are investments pledged as collateral for trust accounts related to nisource's wholly-owned insurance company. available-for-sale securities are included within "other investments" in the consolidated balance sheets. nisource values u.s. treasury, corporate and mortgage-backed securities using a matrix pricing model that incorporates market-based information. these securities trade less frequently and are classified within level 2. total unrealized gains and losses from available-for-sale securities are included in other comprehensive income (loss).
refer to note 16, "fair value," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on nisource's fair value measurements.
other information critical accounting policies nisource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on nisource's results of operations and consolidated financial statements.
basis of accounting for rate-regulated subsidiaries. asc topic 980, regulated operations, provides that rate-regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. the total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets were $1,885.4 million and $1,381.8 million at december 31, 2016, and $1,806.7 million and $1,581.8 million at december 31, 2015, respectively. for additional information, refer to note 8, "regulatory matters," in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for nisource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of nisource's regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of asc topic 980, regulated operations. in such event, a write-down of all or a portion of nisource's existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. if transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under gaap for continued accounting

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nisource inc.
as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. if unable to continue to apply the provisions of asc topic 980, regulated operations, nisource would be required to apply the provisions of asc topic 980-20, discontinuation of rate-regulated accounting. in management's opinion, nisource's regulated subsidiaries will be subject to asc topic 980, regulated operations for the foreseeable future.
certain of the regulatory assets reflected on nisource's consolidated balance sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, nisource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $323.5 million at december 31, 2016. if nisource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts.
pension and postretirement benefits. nisource has defined benefit plans for both pension and other postretirement benefits. the calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, expected long-term returns on plan assets, healthcare trend rates, and mortality rates, among other assumptions. due to the size of the plans and the long-term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred into aoci or a regulatory balance sheet account, depending on the jurisdiction of the nisource entity. these deferred gains or losses are then amortized into the income statement when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets. this is known in gaap as the "corridor" method.
the discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, health care cost trend rates and mortality rates are critical assumptions. methods used to develop these assumptions are described below. while a third party actuarial firm assists with the development of many of these assumptions, nisource is ultimately responsible for selecting the final assumptions.
the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs. nisource's discount rates for both pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using an aa-rated above median yield curve with cash flows matching the expected duration of benefit payments to be made to plan participants.
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is a component utilized in calculating annual pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs. nisource estimates the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, target asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. nisource also considers the guidance from its investment advisors in making a final determination of its expected rate of return on assets.
for measurement of 2017 net periodic benefit cost, nisource selected an expected pre-tax long-term rate of return of 7.25% for its pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets.
nisource estimates the assumed health care cost trend rate, which is used in determining our other postretirement benefit net expense, based upon our actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted legislation, third-party actuarial surveys and general economic conditions.
nisource has historically utilized the society of actuaries' most recently published mortality data in developing a best estimate of mortality as part of the calculation of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.

beginning january 1, 2017, nisource will change the method used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits. this change, compared to the previous method, is expected to result in a decrease in the actuarially-determined service and interest cost components. historically, nisource estimated service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. for fiscal 2017 and beyond, nisource elected to utilize a full yield curve approach to estimate these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. nisource believes the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plan's liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. the benefit obligations measured under this approach are unchanged. nisource will account for this change as a change in accounting estimate and accordingly will account for this prospectively. for further discussion of nisource's pension and other postretirement benefits, see note 11, "pension and other postretirement benefits," in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
goodwill. nisource's goodwill assets at december 31, 2016 were $1,690.7 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of columbia on november 1, 2000. the separation prompted changes in the way nisource's chief operating decision maker manages the business where, going forward, financial accountability is largely at the individual state operating company level. this change in management approach triggered an assessment of nisource's goodwill reporting units. through this assessment, nisource concluded each of the six state operating companies within the former columbia distribution operations reporting unit are now operating segments. nisource further concluded these operating segments represent goodwill reporting units as they do not contain components whose discrete financial information is regularly reviewed by segment management.
goodwill previously allocated to the columbia distribution operations reporting unit was reallocated to the six new reporting units on a relative fair value basis. nisource's remaining reporting unit, nipsco gas operations, was not impacted by the changes in reporting structure as it was historically, and continues to be, reviewed by the chief operating decision maker at a state operating company level.
as required by gaap, nisource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. nisource's annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of may 1, 2016.
nisource completed a quantitative ("step 1") fair value measurement of its reporting units during the may 1, 2016 goodwill test. consistent with nisource's historical impairment testing of goodwill, fair value of the reporting units was determined based on a weighting of income and market approaches. these approaches require significant judgments including appropriate long-term
36
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nisource inc.
growth rates and discount rates for the income approach and appropriate multiples of earnings for peer companies and control premiums for the market approach.
the discount rates were derived using peer company data compiled with the assistance of a third party valuation services firm. the discount rates used are subject to change based on changes in tax rates at both the state and federal level, debt and equity ratios at each reporting unit and general economic conditions.
the long-term growth rate was derived by evaluating historic growth rates, new business and investment opportunities beyond the near term horizon. the long-term growth rate is subject to change depending on inflationary impacts to the u.s. economy and the individual business environments in which each reporting unit operates.
the may 1, 2016 test indicated the fair value of each of the reporting units that carry or are allocated goodwill exceeded their carrying values, indicating that no impairment existed under the step 1 annual impairment test. if the estimates of free cash flow used in this step 1 analysis had been 10% lower, the resulting fair values would have still been greater than the carrying value for each of the reporting units tested, holding all other assumptions constant.
revenue recognition. revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. refer to note 1-i, "revenue recognition," in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
recently issued accounting pronouncements refer to note 2, "recent accounting pronouncements," in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are in the business of discovering, developing, manufacturing and commercializing medicines for serious diseases. we use precision medicine approaches with the goal of creating transformative medicines for patients in specialty markets. our business is focused on developing and commercializing therapies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, or cf, and advancing our research and development programs in other indications, while maintaining our financial strength. our two marketed products are orkambi (lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor) and kalydeco (ivacaftor).
our total net product revenues were $1.7 billion in 2016, an increase of 68% over net product revenues of $1.0 billion in 2015, primarily due to increased orkambi net product revenues, which commenced in the third quarter of 2015, and an increase in kalydeco net product revenues. we expect our net income (loss) and total net product revenues in 2017 will be largely dependent on the level of orkambi net product revenues.
cystic fibrosis orkambi and kalydeco are approved to treat approximately 40% of the 75,000 cf patients in north america, europe, australia and canada. orkambi (lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor) is approved as a treatment for approximately 25,000 patients who have two copies (homozygous) of the f508del mutation in their cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or cftr, gene. kalydeco (ivacaftor) is approved for the treatment of approximately 4,000 cf patients who have the g551d mutation or other specified mutations in their cftr gene. our goal is to develop treatment regimens that will provide benefits to as many patients with cf as possible and will enhance the benefits that currently are being provided to patients taking our medicines.
cf development programs we have multiple development programs in the field of cf, including:
•   tezacaftor (vx-661) is a corrector compound that we are evaluating in a phase 3 development program in combination with ivacaftor in multiple cf patient populations who have at least one copy of the f508del mutation in their cftr gene. we expect data from this phase 3 development program in the first half of 2017. if supported by data from the phase 3 development program, we plan to submit a new drug application, or nda, to the united states food and drug administration, or fda for tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in the second half of 2017.
•   vx-152, vx-440, vx-659 and vx-445 are next-generation cftr corrector compounds that we are evaluating as part of combination treatment regimens. we have initiated phase 2 clinical trials of vx-152 and vx-440 and expect data from these clinical trials in the second half of 2017. we have initiated phase 1 clinical trials of vx-659 and vx-445.
•   vx-371, an investigational epithelial sodium channel, or enac, inhibitor, is being evaluated in a phase 2 development program and which we exclusively licensed from parion sciences, inc., or parion, in 2015.
research and development we are engaged in a number of other research and mid- and early-stage development programs, including in the areas of pain and neurology. we have also entered into third-party collaborations pursuant to which we are engaged in the discovery and development of nucleic acid-based therapies for a variety of diseases, including cf. we plan to continue investing in our research programs and fostering scientific innovation in order to identify and develop transformative medicines. our current research programs include programs targeting cystic fibrosis, adrenoleukodystrophy, alpha-1 antritrypsin deficiency, sickle cell disease and polycystic kidney disease. we believe that pursuing research in diverse areas allows us to balance the risks inherent in drug development and may provide drug candidates that will form our pipeline in future years.
52
collaboration arrangements we have entered into collaborations with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in order to acquire rights or to license drug candidates or technologies that enhance our pipeline and/or our research capabilities. over the last several years, we entered into collaboration agreements with:
•   crispr therapeutics ag, or crispr, pursuant to which we are collaborating on the discovery and development of potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human diseases using crispr-cas9 gene editing technology;
•   parion sciences, inc., or parion, pursuant to which we are developing epithelial sodium channel, or enac, inhibitors for the treatment of pulmonary diseases;
•   moderna therapeutics, inc., or moderna, pursuant to which we are seeking to identify and develop mrna therapeutics for the treatment of cf; and
•   bioaxone biosciences, inc., or bioaxone, pursuant to which we are evaluating vx-210 as a potential treatment for patients who have spinal cord injuries.
generally, when we in-license a technology or drug candidate, we make upfront payments to the collaborator, assume the costs of the program and agree to make contingent payments, which could consist of milestone, royalty and option payments. depending on many factors, including the structure of the collaboration, the significance of the drug candidate that we license to the collaborator's operations and the other activities in which our collaborators are engaged, the accounting for these transactions can vary significantly. for example, the upfront payments and expenses incurred in connection with our crispr and moderna collaborations are being expensed as research expenses because the collaboration represents a small portion of these collaborators overall business. crispr and moderna's activities unrelated to our collaborations have no effect on our consolidated financial statements. parion and bioaxone are being accounted for as variable interest entities, or vies, and are included in our consolidated financial statements due to (i) the significance of the respective licensed programs to parion and bioaxone as a whole, (ii) our power to control the significant activities under each collaboration and (iii) our obligation to absorb losses and right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant. each of our consolidated vies are engaging in activities unrelated to our collaboration, including in the case of parion, seeking to develop novel treatments for pulmonary and ocular diseases. the revenues and expenses unrelated to the programs we in-license from our vies are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. in each case, the activities unrelated to our collaboration represent less than 1% of our total revenues and total expenses. because we consolidate our vies, we evaluate the fair value of the contingent payments payable by us on a quarterly basis. changes in the fair value of these contingent future payments affect net income attributable to vertex on a dollar-for-dollar basis, with increases in the fair value of contingent payments payable by us to a vie resulting in a decrease in net income attributable to vertex (or an increase in net loss attributable to vertex) and decreases in the fair value of contingent payments payable by us to a vie resulting in an increase in net income attributable to vertex (or decrease in net loss attributable to vertex). for additional information regarding our vies see note b "collaborative arrangements" and our critical accounting policies "collaborations; variable interest entities."
we have also out-licensed internally developed programs to collaborators who are leading the development of these programs. these outlicense arrangements include our collaboration agreements with:
•   merck kgaa, pursuant to which merck kgaa will, subject to regulatory approval, obtain rights to four oncology research and development programs; and
•   janssen pharmaceuticals, inc. which is developing jnj-3872 (formerly vx-787) for the treatment of influenza.
pursuant to these outlicensing arrangements, our collaborators are responsible for the research, development and commercialization costs associated with these programs and we are entitled to receive contingent milestone and/or royalty payments. as a result, we do not expect to incur significant expenses in connection with these programs and have the potential for future collaborative and/or royalty revenues resulting from these programs.
drug discovery and development discovery and development of a new pharmaceutical product is a difficult and lengthy process that requires significant financial resources along with extensive technical and regulatory expertise and can take 10 to 15 years or more. potential drug candidates are subjected to rigorous evaluations, driven in part by stringent regulatory considerations, designed to
53
generate information concerning efficacy, side-effects, proper dosage levels and a variety of other physical and chemical characteristics that are important in determining whether a drug candidate should be approved for marketing as a pharmaceutical product. most chemical compounds that are investigated as potential drug candidates never progress into development, and most drug candidates that do advance into development never receive marketing approval. because our investments in drug candidates are subject to considerable risks, we closely monitor the results of our discovery, research, clinical trials and nonclinical studies and frequently evaluate our drug development programs in light of new data and scientific, business and commercial insights, with the objective of balancing risk and potential. this process can result in abrupt changes in focus and priorities as new information becomes available and as we gain additional understanding of our ongoing programs and potential new programs, as well as those of our competitors.
if we believe that data from a completed registration program support approval of a drug candidate, we submit an nda to the fda requesting approval to market the drug candidate in the united states and seek analogous approvals from comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions. to obtain approval, we must, among other things, demonstrate with evidence gathered in nonclinical studies and well-controlled clinical trials that the drug candidate is safe and effective for the disease it is intended to treat and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls for the manufacture of the drug candidate are adequate. the fda and foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in deciding whether or not a drug candidate should be granted approval based on the benefits and risks of the drug candidate in the treatment of a particular disease, and could delay, limit or deny regulatory approval. if regulatory delays are significant or regulatory approval is limited or denied altogether, our financial results and the commercial prospects for the drug candidate involved will be harmed.
regulatory compliance our marketing of pharmaceutical products is subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations. we have a corporate compliance program designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems, and through the promotion of a culture of compliance. among other laws, regulations and standards, we are subject to various u.s. federal and state laws, and comparable foreign laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims statutes, and laws prohibiting the promotion of drugs for unapproved or off-label uses. anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. false claims laws prohibit anyone from presenting for payment to third-party payors, including medicare and medicaid, claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to maintain, administer and expand these compliance programs globally.
reimbursement sales of our products depend, to a large degree, on the extent to which our products are covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed health care organizations. we dedicate substantial management and other resources in order to obtain and maintain appropriate levels of reimbursement for our products from third-party payors, including governmental organizations in the united states and ex-u.s. markets. in the united states, we continue to engage in discussions with numerous commercial insurers and managed health care organizations, along with government health programs that are typically managed by authorities in the individual states. in europe and other ex-u.s. markets, we are working to obtain government reimbursement for orkambi on a country-by-country basis, because in many foreign countries patients are unable to access prescription pharmaceutical products that are not reimbursed by their governments. in the fourth quarter of 2016, we reached a pricing and reimbursement agreement for orkambi with the german federal association of the statutory health insurances. consistent with our experience with kalydeco when it was first approved, we expect reimbursement discussions in ex-u.s. markets may take a significant period of time.
recent transaction in january 2017, we entered into a strategic collaboration and license agreement with merck kgaa, darmstadt, germany, or merck kgaa. pursuant to the agreement, we granted merck kgaa an exclusive worldwide license to research, develop and commercialize four oncology research and development programs, including our ataxia telangiectasia and rad3-related protein inhibitor, or atr program, including vx-970 and vx-803, and our dna-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, or dna-pk program, including vx-984. under the agreement, we expect to receive an up-front payment of $230.0 million, subject to hart-scott rodino clearance, and tiered royalties on potential sales of licensed products.

net loss attributable to vertex comparison of net loss attributable to vertex 2016 vs. 2015
net loss attributable to vertex was $112.1 million in 2016 as compared to a net loss attributable to vertex of $556.3 million in 2015. our revenues increased significantly in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to a $628.9 million increase in orkambi net product revenues, which we began selling in mid-2015, and a $71.8 million increase in kalydeco net product revenues, partially offset by decreases in our royalty revenues and collaborative revenues. our operating costs and expenses increased in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to increases in cost of product revenues, research and development expenses, sales, general and administrative expenses.
the change in our other items, net was primarily due to a $54.9 million increase in the fair value of contingent payments related to our consolidated vies, which results in an increase in net loss attributable to vertex.
comparison of net loss attributable to vertex 2015 vs. 2014
net loss attributable to vertex was $556.3 million in 2015 as compared to a net loss attributable to vertex of $738.6 million in 2014. our revenues increased significantly in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to orkambi net product revenues, which commenced in the third quarter of 2015, and a $167.9 million increase in kalydeco net product revenues, partially offset by a $43.6 million decrease in our collaborative revenues. our operating costs and expenses increased in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to increases in research and development expenses, sales, general and administrative expenses and cost of product revenues, partially offset by decreased restructuring expenses and royalty expenses.
our other items, net in 2015 and 2014, included $4.5 million and $0.5 million increases in the fair value of contingent payments related to our consolidated vies, which resulted in corresponding increases in net loss attributable to vertex.
earnings per share in 2016, 2015 and 2014, net loss attributable to vertex was $0.46, $2.31 and $3.14, respectively, per diluted share. in 2016, 2015 and 2014, net loss from continuing operations attributable to vertex was $0.46, $2.31 and $3.14, respectively, per diluted share.
common shares outstanding our shares of outstanding common stock increased from 246.3 million shares on december 31, 2015 to 248.3 million shares on december 31, 2016 due to our issuance in 2016 of approximately 2.0 million shares of common stock pursuant to our employee equity programs. our shares of outstanding common stock increased from 241.8 million shares on december 31, 2014 to 246.3 million shares on december 31, 2015 due to our issuance in 2015 of approximately 4.5 million shares of common stock issued pursuant to our employee equity programs.

our total net product revenues increased by 68% in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to increased net product revenues from orkambi, which was approved by the fda in july 2015, and increased kalydeco net product revenues.
orkambi sales commenced in mid-2015 and orkambi net product revenues increased from $350.7 million in 2015 to $979.6 million in 2016. in 2015 and 2016, we recognized approximately $1.6 million and $76.4 million, respectively, in ex-u.s. orkambi net product revenues, which were mainly from germany. we also are distributing orkambi in france pursuant to an early access program, but are not recognizing any revenues on orkambi sales in france because the price is not fixed or determinable. our consolidated balance sheets include $73.4 million collected as of december 31, 2016 in france related to orkambi. we believe that the level of our orkambi revenues during 2017 will be dependent whether, when and on what terms we are able to obtain reimbursement in additional ex-u.s. markets, the number and rate at which additional patients begin treatment with orkambi, the proportion of initiated patients who remain on treatment and the compliance rates for patients who remain on treatment.
in 2016, kalydeco net product revenues were $703.4 million, including $303.9 million of net product revenues from ex-u.s. markets, compared to kalydeco net product revenues of $631.7 million in 2015, including $266.1 million of net product revenues from ex-u.s. markets. in 2017, we expect our kalydeco net product revenues will be similar to our kalydeco net product revenues in 2016. in 2014, kalydeco net product revenues were $463.8 million, including $201.4 million of net product revenues from ex-u.s. markets. the increases were primarily due to additional patients being treated with kalydeco as we completed reimbursement discussions in various jurisdictions and to the increased number of patients eligible to receive kalydeco through label expansions.
incivek net product revenues were $0.6 million, $18.0 million and $24.1 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we have withdrawn incivek from the market and may continue to have small adjustments to incivek revenues over the next several quarters as we adjust our incivek reserves for rebates, chargebacks and discounts.
royalty revenues our royalty revenues were $16.6 million, $24.0 million and $40.9 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. since the beginning of 2014, our royalty revenues have consisted of (i) revenues related to a cash payment we received in 2008
56
when we sold our rights to certain hiv royalties and (ii) revenues related to certain third-party royalties payable by our collaborators on sales of hiv drugs and telaprevir that also result in corresponding royalty expenses.
collaborative revenues our collaborative revenues were $1.9 million, $8.1 million and $51.7 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. in 2014, the majority of our collaborative revenues related to $35.0 million in payments we received from janssen inc. related to our outlicense of vx-787. our collaborative revenues have historically fluctuated significantly from one period to another and may continue to fluctuate in the future. we expect our collaborative revenues to increase significantly in 2017 as a result of the $230.0 million upfront payment we expect to receive pursuant to the collaboration agreement with merck kgaa that we entered into in january 2017.

cost of product revenues our cost of product revenues includes the cost of producing inventories that corresponded to product revenues for the reporting period, plus the third-party royalties payable on our net sales of our products. pursuant to our agreement with cystic fibrosis foundation therapeutics incorporated, or cfft, our tiered third-party royalties on sales of kalydeco and orkambi, calculated as a percentage of net sales, range from the single digits to the sub-teens.
our cost of product revenues have been increasing due primarily to increased net product revenues. in each of 2016 and 2015, our cost of product revenues included a $13.9 million commercial milestone that was earned by cfft related to sales of orkambi. there are no further commercial milestones payable to cfft. in future periods, our cost of product revenues will not be affected by commercial milestones on orkambi, with our cost of product revenues generally tracking our net product revenues.
royalty expenses royalty expenses include third-party royalties payable upon net sales of telaprevir by our collaborators in their territories and expenses related to a subroyalty payable to a third party on net sales of an hiv protease inhibitor sold by glaxosmithkline. royalty expenses do not include royalties we pay to cfft on sales of kalydeco and orkambi, which instead are included in cost of product revenues.

our research and development expenses include internal and external costs incurred for research and development of our drugs and drug candidates. we do not assign our internal costs, such as salary and benefits, stock-based compensation expense, laboratory supplies and other direct expenses and infrastructure costs, to individual drugs or drug candidates, because the employees within our research and development groups typically are deployed across multiple research and development programs. these internal costs are significantly greater than our external costs, such as the costs of services provided to us by clinical research organizations and other outsourced research, which we allocate by individual program. all research and development costs for our drugs and drug candidates are expensed as incurred.
over the past three years, we have incurred $2.9 billion in research and development expenses associated with drug discovery and development. the successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks. in addition, the duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type, complexity and novelty of the drug candidate and the disease indication being targeted. the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products, typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures. data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activities. data obtained from these activities also are susceptible of varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. the duration and cost of discovery, nonclinical studies and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project and are difficult to predict. therefore, accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our drug candidates to market are not available.
in 2014, 2015 and 2016, costs related to our cf programs represented the largest portion of our development costs. any estimates regarding development and regulatory timelines for our drug candidates are highly subjective and subject to change. we cannot make a meaningful estimate when, if ever, our other clinical development programs will generate revenues and cash flows.

our development expenses increased by $75.0 million, or 11%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 and increased by $60.1 million, or 10%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. the increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase in outsourced services related to ongoing clinical trials, including our phase 3 development program for tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor and increases in salary and benefits, laboratory supplies and other direct expenses and infrastructure costs. we expect our development expenses to increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to activities related to clinical trials, including continuation of the phase 3 development program for tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor as well as clinical trials associated with our next-generation correctors.
the increased development expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014 were primarily due to an increase in outsourced services related to ongoing clinical trials, including our phase 3 development program for tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor and an increase in stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by decreased infrastructure costs and decreased laboratory supplies and other direct expenses.

sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 15% in 2016 as compared to 2015, and by 23% in 2015 as compared to 2014. these increases were primarily due to increased investment in commercial support for orkambi in the united states and ex-u.s. markets.
restructuring expense in 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded restructuring expenses of $1.3 million, $2.2 million and $50.9 million, respectively. our restructuring expenses in 2014 were primarily related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters in massachusetts to boston from cambridge. as of december 31, 2016, our accrued restructuring liability related to our lease obligation in cambridge was $8.0 million. this lease obligation expires in april 2018.

other items, net interest expense, net in 2016, 2015 and 2014, interest expense, net was $81.4 million, $84.2 million and $72.9 million, respectively. the decrease in interest expense, net in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to a lower interest rate on the $300.0 million of outstanding borrowings following the refinancing of our credit agreement in october 2016. the increase in interest expense, net in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the interest expense we incurred for the full fiscal year in 2015 on the $300.0 million that we borrowed in mid-2014 pursuant to our prior credit agreement. we expect our interest expense, net in 2017 to be dependent on the amounts we borrow pursuant to our revolving credit agreement during 2017.
other income (expense), net in 2016, net other income was $4.1 million and primarily due to foreign exchange gains. in 2015, net other expense was $6.7 million primarily due to foreign exchange losses. in 2014, we recorded net other income of $30.4 million primarily due to a credit of $36.7 million related to a one-time cash payment we received in 2014 from our landlord pursuant to leases for our corporate headquarters in boston, massachusetts.
income taxes in 2016, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $16.7 million, principally related to income taxes payable by our vies. in 2015, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $30.4 million, principally due to the consolidation of parion as a vie into our consolidated financial statements in the second quarter of 2015. in 2014, our provision for income taxes was $7.0 million, of which approximately $3.9 million was due to the consolidation of bioaxone as a vie into our consolidated financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2014.
noncontrolling interest (vies)
the net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (vies) recorded on our consolidated statements of operations reflects parion and bioaxone's net loss (income) for the reporting period, adjusted for any changes in the noncontrolling interest holders' claim to net assets, including contingent milestone, royalty and option payments. a summary of net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest related to our vies for the three years ended december 31, 2016 is as follows:

discontinued operations in 2014, we recorded a loss from discontinued operations attributable to vertex of $0.9 million. our loss from discontinued operations in this period included losses due to the deconsolidation of alios biopharma, inc, or alios, our former collaborator, prior to the termination of our collaboration agreement with alios in the fourth quarter of 2014.
liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.43 billion, which represented an increase of $392.1 million from approximately $1.04 billion as of december 31, 2015. the increase in our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance was primarily due to increased cash receipts in 2016 from product sales, partially offset by increased cash expenditures in 2016 related to, among other things, research and development expenses and sales, general and administrative expenses.
our future cash flows will be substantially dependent on product sales of orkambi and kalydeco.
60
sources of liquidity we intend to rely on our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash flows from product sales as our primary source of liquidity. we are receiving cash flows from sales of orkambi and kalydeco from the united states and ex-u.s. markets. future net product revenues for orkambi from ex-u.s. markets will be dependent on, among other things, the timing of and ability to complete reimbursement discussions in european countries. under the agreement we entered into in the first quarter of 2016 with merck kgaa, we expect to receive an up-front payment of $230.0 million in 2017, subject to hart-scott rodino clearance.
as of december 31, 2016, we had borrowed $300.0 million under a five-year $500.0 million revolving credit facility that we entered into in october 2016. we may repay and reborrow amounts under the revolving credit agreement without penalty. subject to certain conditions, we may request that the borrowing capacity under this credit agreement be increased by an additional $300.0 million. in february 2017, we repaid the $300.0 million that we had borrowed pursuant to the revolving credit agreement plus accrued interest using existing cash resources.
in 2014 and 2015, we also received significant proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit plans, but we received limited proceeds from employee benefit plans in 2016 and the amount and timing of future proceeds from employee benefits plans is uncertain. other possible sources of liquidity include strategic collaborative agreements that include research and/or development funding, commercial debt, public and private offerings of our equity and debt securities, development milestones and royalties on sales of products, software and equipment leases, strategic sales of assets or businesses and financial transactions. negative covenants in our credit agreement may prohibit or limit our ability to access these sources of liquidity.
future capital requirements we incur substantial operating expenses to conduct research and development activities and to operate our organization. under the terms of our credit agreement entered into in october 2016, we are required to repay all outstanding principal amounts in 2021. we also have substantial facility and capital lease obligations, including leases for two buildings in boston, massachusetts that continue through 2028. in addition, we have entered into certain collaboration agreements with third parties that include the funding of certain research, development and commercialization efforts with the potential for future milestone and royalty payments by us upon the achievement of pre-established developmental and regulatory targets.
we expect that cash flows from orkambi and kalydeco, together with our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. the adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the amounts of future revenues generated by orkambi and kalydeco and the potential introduction of one or more of our other drug candidates to the market, the level of our business development activities and the number, breadth, cost and prospects of our research and development programs.
financing strategy we have a $500.0 million revolving credit facility that we entered into in october 2016. we may repay and reborrow amounts under the revolving credit agreement without penalty. in addition, subject to certain conditions, we may request that the borrowing capacity under this credit agreement be increased by an additional $300.0 million. we may raise additional capital through public offerings or private placements of our securities or securing new collaborative agreements or other methods of financing. we will continue to manage our capital structure and will consider all financing opportunities, whenever they may occur, that could strengthen our long-term liquidity profile. there can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.

leases we lease two buildings that are located at fan pier in boston, massachusetts. we commenced lease payments on these two buildings in december 2013 and the initial lease periods end in december 2028.
in december 2015, we entered into a lease agreement, pursuant to which we agreed to lease approximately 170,000 square feet of office and laboratory space in a building under construction in san diego, california. the lease will commence upon completion of the building, scheduled for the first half of 2018 and will extend for 16 years from the commencement date. the future minimum rental payments that we are obligated to pay after taking occupancy are included in "facility leases, excluding fan pier leases."
we currently lease laboratory and office space at our former kendall square facility in cambridge, massachusetts that will expire in 2018. our future minimum commitments under our kendall square lease are included in "facility leases, excluding fan pier leases." we have entered into three subleases for a portion of the rentable square footage at the kendall square facility to offset our on-going contractual lease obligations. the future minimum committed income from the subleases is $15.7 million for 2017 and $5.2 million total for 2018. these amounts are not offset against our obligations set forth in the table above.
the table also reflects leases of equipment, leasehold improvements and software licenses that are accounted for as capital leases.
revolving credit facility in october 2016, we entered into a revolving credit agreement and borrowed $300.0 million under a $500.0 million revolving credit facility. subject to certain conditions, we may request that the borrowing capacity under this credit agreement be increased by an additional $300.0 million. the outstanding loan bears interest at a rate of libor plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.50%, based on our consolidated leverage ratio (the ratio of our total consolidated funded indebtedness to our consolidated ebitda for the most recently completed four fiscal quarter period). the table above reflects the $300.0 million outstanding as of december 31, 2016. the above table assumes the repayment of the $300.0 million in 2017 because we repaid the outstanding amounts under the credit agreement in february 2017. we may reborrow and repay amounts under the revolving credit agreement without penalty.
research, development and drug supply costs research, development and drug supply costs, does not include certain payments we are obligated to make to clinical research organizations, or cros, because these contracts are cancelable, at our option, with notice. however, we historically have not cancelled such contracts. as of december 31, 2016, we had accrued $25.1 million related to these contracts for costs incurred for services provided through december 31, 2016, and we have approximately $175.1 million in cancelable future commitments based on existing contracts as of december 31, 2016. these amounts reflect planned expenditures based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts.
62
collaborative arrangements we have entered into certain research and development collaboration agreements with third parties that include the funding of certain development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts with the potential for future milestone and royalty payments by us upon the achievement of pre-established developmental, regulatory and/or commercial targets. our obligation to fund these efforts is contingent upon continued involvement in the programs and/or the lack of any adverse events that could cause the discontinuance of the programs. our payment obligations under these collaborations include the following:
•   cfft: cfft has the right to tiered royalties ranging from single digits to sub-teens on any approved drugs first synthesized and/or tested during a research term on or before february 28, 2014, including kalydeco, orkambi, lumacaftor and tezacaftor and royalties ranging from low single digits to mid-single digits on potential sales of certain compounds first synthesized and/or tested between march 1, 2014 and august 31, 2016.
•   parion: parion has the potential to receive milestone and royalty payments, including up to $490.0 million in development and regulatory milestone payments for the development of vx-371 and/or vx-551 to treat cf.
•   crispr: crispr has the potential to receive milestone and royalty payments, including up to $420.0 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments for each of up to six targets pursuant to the collaboration.
•   moderna: moderna has the potential to receive milestone and royalty payments, including up to $275.0 million in development and regulatory milestones.
•   bioaxone: bioaxone has the potential to receive milestone and royalty payments, including up to $90.0 million in development and regulatory milestone payments (including a license continuation fee).
contingent payments under these agreements become due and payable only upon achievement of certain milestones and are not included in the contractual obligations table above.
tax-related obligations we exclude liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions from our summary of contractual obligations as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. as of december 31, 2016, we did not have any liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. as of december 31, 2016, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount we expect to pay within the next twelve months in connection with any such settlements.
other funding commitments our table detailing contractual commitments and obligations does not include severance payment obligations to certain of our executive officers in the event of a not-for-cause employment termination under existing employment contracts. we provide information regarding these obligations annually in our proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders.
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. these items are monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which the change occurs. we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate.
63
we believe that our application of the following accounting policies, each of which requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results:
•   revenue recognition;
•   intangible assets;
•   collaborations and variable interest entities;
•   research and development accruals;
•   commercial supplies and inventories;
•   income taxes;
•   leases;
•   restructuring expenses; and
•   stock-based compensation expense.
our accounting policies, including the ones discussed below, are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, including note a, "nature of business and accounting policies," included in this annual report on form 10-k.
revenue recognition product revenues, net we generate product revenues from sales in the united states and in international markets. we sell our products principally to a limited number of specialty pharmacy providers and selected regional wholesalers in north america as well as government-owned and supported customers in international markets, collectively, our customers. our customers in north america subsequently resell our products to patients and health care providers. we contract with government agencies and various private organizations so that our products will be eligible for purchase by, or partial or full reimbursement from, such third-party payors. we recognize net product revenues from sales of our products upon delivery to our customers as long as:
•   there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists between us and our customer;
•   collectability is reasonably assured; and
•   the price is fixed or determinable.
in order to conclude that the price is fixed or determinable, we must be able to calculate our gross product revenues from our customers and reasonably estimate our net product revenues upon delivery to our customers' locations. our gross product revenues are based on the fixed price for our products that we charge our customers. we estimate our net product revenues by deducting from our gross product revenues (i) trade allowances, such as invoice discounts for prompt payment and customer fees, (ii) estimated government and private payor rebates, chargebacks and discounts, (iii) estimated reserves for expected product returns and (iv) estimated costs of co-pay assistance programs for patients, as well as other incentives for certain indirect customers. we make significant estimates and judgments that materially affect our recognition of net product revenues. changes in our estimates of net product revenues could have a material effect on net product revenues recorded in the period in which we determine that change occurs.
in certain instances, we may be unable to reasonably conclude that the price is fixed or determinable at the time of delivery, in which case we defer the recognition of revenues. for example, we are distributing orkambi in france pursuant to early access programs but have not recognized any product revenues based on these sales because the price was not fixed or determinable due to the ongoing negotiations regarding the reimbursement rate for orkambi in france. once we are able to determine that the price is fixed or determinable, we recognize the revenues associated with the units in which revenue recognition was deferred. our consolidated balance sheets include $73.4 million collected as of december 31, 2016 in france related to orkambi.
the value of the rebates, chargebacks and discounts provided to third-party payors per course of treatment vary significantly and are based on government-mandated discounts and our arrangements with other third-party payors. in order to estimate our total rebates, chargebacks and discounts, we estimate the percentage of prescriptions that will be covered by each third-party payor, which is referred to as the payor mix. we track available information regarding changes, if any, to the
64
payor mix for our products, to our contractual terms with third-party payors and to applicable governmental programs and regulations and levels of our products in the distribution channel. we adjust our estimated rebates, chargebacks and discounts based on new information, including information regarding actual rebates, chargebacks and discounts for our products, as it becomes available. claims by third-party payors for rebates, chargebacks and discounts frequently are submitted to us significantly after the related sales, potentially resulting in adjustments in the period in which the new information becomes known.
our customers generally have the right to return unopened unprescribed packages subject to contractual limitations. to date returns have been minimal and, based on inventory levels held by our customers and our distribution model, we believe that returns of products will continue to be minimal. we track actual returns by individual production lots and will continue to monitor inventory levels in the distribution channel. if necessary, we will adjust our estimated product returns based on new information as it becomes available.
collaborative revenues we recognize revenues generated through collaborative research, development and/or commercialization agreements. the terms of these agreements typically include payment to us of one or more of the following: nonrefundable, up-front license fees; development and commercial milestone payments; funding of research and/or development activities; payments for services we provide through our third-party manufacturing network; and royalties on net sales of licensed products. each of these types of payments results in collaborative revenues, except for revenues from royalties on net sales of licensed products, which are classified as royalty revenues.
for each collaborative research, development and/or commercialization agreement that results in revenues, we determine (i) whether multiple deliverables exist, (ii) whether the undelivered elements have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, (iii) how the deliverables should be separated and (iv) how the consideration should be allocated to the deliverables. we allocate consideration in an arrangement using the relative selling price method based on our best estimate of selling price of deliverables if we do not have vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence. as part of the accounting for these agreements, we must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the best estimate of selling price. we utilize key assumptions to determine the best estimate of selling price, which may include patient enrollment requirements from regulatory authorities, development timelines, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, discount rates, and estimated third-party development costs.
intangible assets we maintain an indefinite-lived in-process research and development asset on our consolidated balance sheet until either the research and development project underlying it is completed or the asset becomes impaired. when we determine that an asset has become impaired or we abandon a project, we write down the carrying value of the related intangible asset to its fair value and take an impairment charge in the period in which the impairment occurs.
we assess the fair value of assets, including intangible assets such as in-process research and development assets, using a variety of methods, including present-value models that are based upon multiple probability-weighted scenarios involving the development and potential commercialization of the acquired drug candidates. the present-value models require us to make significant assumptions regarding the estimates that market participants would make in evaluating a drug candidate, including the probability of successfully completing clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval to market the drug candidate, the timing of and the expected costs to complete in-process research and development projects, future net cash flows from potential drug sales, which are based on estimates of the sales price of the drug, the number of patients who will be diagnosed and treated and our competitive position in the marketplace, and appropriate discount and tax rates.
we test our intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of october 1, and more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstance suggest that impairment may exist. events that could result in an impairment, or trigger an interim impairment assessment, include the receipt of additional clinical or nonclinical data regarding our drug candidate or a potentially competitive drug candidate, changes in the clinical development program for a drug candidate or new information regarding potential sales for the drug. in connection with each annual impairment assessment and any interim impairment assessment, we compare the fair value of the asset as of the date of the assessment with the carrying value of the asset on our consolidated balance sheet.
as of december 31, 2016, we had $284.3 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet related to parion and bioaxone, our variable interest entities, or vies.
65
collaborations; variable interest entities our collaborations require us to apply accounting policies that involve significant judgments and that have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. we review each collaboration agreement pursuant to which we license assets owned by a collaborator in order to determine whether we have a variable interest via the license agreement with the collaborator and if the variable interest is a variable interest in the collaborator as a whole. in connection with this assessment, we consider and make judgments regarding the following, among other factors: (1) whether the collaborator is a business; (2) the purpose and design of the collaborator; (3) the value of the asset as compared to the value of the collaborator as a whole; and (4) which party has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the collaborator's economic performance. for example, in connection with the parion collaboration we determined that (a) parion is a business; (b) the purpose and redesign of parion was to advance the development and commercialization of the licensed assets with a company that is able to effectively develop and commercialize products for the treatment of cystic fibrosis and other pulmonary diseases; (c) the licensed assets represented significantly more than half the value of parion; and (d) through the joint steering committee, we have the power to direct the development and commercialization of parion's enac inhibitors, which are the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of parion. based on this analysis, we consolidate parion's financial statements into our financial statements. similarly, we have determined that bioaxone is a vie that we consolidate into our financial statements.
we evaluate on a quarterly basis if we continue to have a variable interest in each vie and are the primary beneficiary of the vie, and if we later determine that we no longer have a variable interest or are no longer the primary beneficiary, we deconsolidate the applicable vie. this evaluation involves an assessment of the activities being conducted pursuant to our collaboration agreement with the collaborator, the collaborator's financial statements, discussions with the collaborator's management regarding its other activities, including any new collaborations, financing activities, clinical data and the collaborator's other programs.
we believe that the following effects of the consolidation and deconsolidation of vies on our consolidated financial statements are the most significant:
•   in each period, we record net income (loss) attributable to our vies noncontrolling interest. this net income (loss) reflects our vies net income (loss) for the period as adjusted for gains and losses in the fair value of the contingent payments, which consist of milestone, royalty and option payments, payable by us to our vies. determining the fair value of the contingent payments payable by us to our vies requires us to make significant estimates regarding the probability and potential timing of achieving each of the milestones pursuant to the agreement, future potential net sales of licensed products and appropriate discount rates. we expect that the net income (loss) attributed to noncontrolling interest will continue to be affected by changes in the fair value of the contingent payments. in 2016, 2015 and 2014, the fair value of contingent payments payable by us increased by $54.9 million, $4.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively. the increase in fair value of the contingent payments in 2016 primarily related to a phase 2 clinical trial of vx-371, a compound in-licensed from parion, achieving its primary safety endpoint in the second quarter of 2016. the increases in the fair value of contingent payments increased our net loss attributable to vertex on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
•   we recorded $255.3 million and $29.0 million, respectively, of intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet based on our estimate of the fair value of parion's and bioaxone's in-process research and development assets as of the transaction date and made significant estimates regarding: the probability of obtaining regulatory approval of licensed products; the timing and expected costs of clinical trials and other development activities; future potential cash flows from sales of drugs and the appropriate discount rates. if we are successful in developing a drug candidate, we will amortize the carrying value of the relevant intangible asset as part of cost of product revenues. we test these in-process research and development assets for impairment on an annual basis as of october 1, and more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. if the fair value of a licensed program becomes impaired as the result of safety or efficacy data from any ongoing or future clinical trial conducted by us or our competitors or because of any other information regarding the prospects of successfully developing or commercializing the licensed drug candidate, we could incur significant charges in the period in which the impairment occurs. we determined the fair value of these in-process research and development assets using probability-weighted present-value models.
66
•   the revenues and expenses of our vies that are unrelated to the programs that we in-license from our vies and that are consolidated into our financial statements are set forth in the table below and represent less than 1% of our revenues and expenses in each period:
2016                                                                                               2015                           2014
(in thousands)
revenues                                                                                $944              $2,888                $-
research and development expenses                                                     (6,762   )          (3,642   )          (286   )
sales, general and administrative expenses                                            (4,160   )          (5,836   )          (491   )
other (expenses) income, net                                                            (108   )             (56   )            13
loss attributable to noncontrolling interest before provision for income taxes      $(10,086   )         $(6,646   )         $(764   )
to the extent that our vies pursue other programs, expenses related to those activities would be reflected in our research and development expenses and our sales, general and administrative expenses as a result of the financial statement consolidation. we would not be entitled to any benefits from those activities. in future periods, our vies could increase their operating expenses related to other activities and any such increases would affect our operating expenses as presented in our consolidated financial statements.
•   we reflect all of our vies' cash and cash equivalents under the heading "restricted cash and cash equivalents (vie)" on our consolidated balance sheets. we do not have any rights to our vies cash or cash equivalents, these resources are not available to fund research and development programs pursuant to the collaborations and these amounts do not provide us with any additional liquidity. our vies have control over the restricted cash and cash equivalents (vie), including the ability to distribute the restricted cash and cash equivalents to their equity holders, and as a result, these assets, although carried on our consolidated balance sheets, are not included in the discussion of our liquidity and should be disregarded when evaluating our financial condition.
in order to account for the fair value of the intangible assets and contingent payments related to collaborations with our vies under gaap, we use present-value models based on assumptions regarding the probability of achieving the relevant milestones, estimates regarding the timing of achieving the milestones, estimates of future product sales and the appropriate discount rates. we base our estimates of the probability of achieving the relevant milestones on industry data for similar assets and our own experience. the discount rates used in the valuation model represent a measure of credit risk and market risk associated with settling the liabilities. significant judgment is used in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions during each reporting period. changes in these assumptions could have a material effect on the fair value of the contingent payments and affect the analysis of whether or not an intangible asset is impaired.
research and development accruals research and development expenses, including amounts funded through research and development collaborations, are expensed as incurred. when third-party service providers' billing terms do not coincide with our period-end, we are required to make estimates of our obligations to those third parties, including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs, contractual services costs, costs for drug supply, marketing expenses and infrastructure expenses incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at the end of the period. we base our estimates on our knowledge of the research and development programs, services performed for the period, experience with related activities and the expected duration of the third-party service contract, where applicable.
commercial supplies and inventories we began capitalizing the costs of our orkambi inventories on july 1, 2014. we capitalize inventories produced in preparation for initiating sales of a drug candidate when the related drug candidate is considered to have a high likelihood of regulatory approval and the related costs are expected to be recoverable through sale of the inventories. in determining whether or not to capitalize such inventories, we evaluate, among other factors, information regarding the drug candidate's safety and efficacy, the status of regulatory submissions and communications with regulatory authorities and the outlook for commercial sales, including the existence of current or anticipated competitive drugs and the availability of reimbursement. in addition, we evaluate risks associated with manufacturing the drug candidate and the remaining shelf life of the inventories. after we begin capitalizing inventories, we perform an assessment of the recoverability of capitalized inventory during each reporting period, and write down any excess and obsolete inventories to their net realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified. periodic assessments of the recoverability of capitalized costs involve significant estimates and judgments on the part of management.
as of december 31, 2016, all of our inventories are related to kalydeco and orkambi.
67
income taxes we maintain a valuation allowance on the majority of our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets because we have an extended history of annual losses. our u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards totaled approximately $4.1 billion as of december 31, 2016. on an annual basis, we reassess the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets. after consideration of all the evidence, both positive and negative, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset as of december 31, 2016 because it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. in future periods, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized, (i) the valuation allowance would be decreased, (ii) the deferred tax asset would be reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and (iii) we would record non-cash benefits in our consolidated statements of operations related to the reflection of the deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet.
leases in 2011, we entered into two leases for our corporate headquarters. our corporate headquarters were built during the period from 2011 through december 2013. we lease our corporate headquarters pursuant to leases that expire in 2028, subject to our right to extend the leases for an additional 10 years. because we were involved in the construction project, we were deemed for accounting purposes to be the owner of the buildings during the construction period. accordingly, we record project construction costs incurred by the landlord as an asset and a related financing obligation in "property and equipment, net" and "construction financing lease obligation," respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.
upon completion of the construction of the corporate headquarters buildings, we evaluated the leases and determined that the leases did not meet the criteria for "sale-leaseback" treatment. accordingly, we depreciate the asset and incur interest expense related to the financing obligation recorded on our balance sheet. we bifurcate our lease payments pursuant to the leases into (i) a portion that is allocated to the buildings and (ii) a portion that is allocated to the land on which the buildings were constructed. the portion of the lease obligations allocated to the land is treated as an operating lease. in connection with the leases for our corporate headquarters, we incurred $60.2 million in interest expense, $13.3 million in depreciation expense and $6.5 million in operating expense in 2016. in 2017, we expect interest expense, depreciation expense and operating expenses related to the leases for our corporate headquarters to be approximately consistent with that from 2016.
in 2015, we entered into a lease agreement for a research and development facility to be built in san diego. because we are involved in the construction project, we are deemed for accounting purposes to be the owner of the building during the construction period and are recording project construction costs incurred by the landlord. we will need to evaluate this lease based on "sale-leaseback" criteria upon completion of the construction. we currently expect this lease will not meet the criteria and will be accounted for in the same manner as we have accounted for the leases for our corporate headquarters.
restructuring expenses we have adopted several plans to restructure our facility operations for which we have incurred restructuring expenses in the three years ended december 31, 2016. in particular, in 2014, we recorded $50.9 million in costs associated with exit and disposal activities related to the relocation of our headquarters in massachusetts from cambridge to boston and maintained a liability related to these activities of $3.6 million as of december 31, 2016. our initial estimate of our liabilities for net ongoing costs associated with these facility obligations are recorded at fair value. in estimating the expenses and liabilities related to these facilities, we utilize probability-weighted discounted cash-flows of our ongoing lease obligations. in estimating the expense and liability under our lease obligations, we estimate (i) the costs to be incurred to satisfy rental and build-out commitments under the lease (including operating costs), (ii) the lead-time necessary to sublease the space, (iii) the projected sublease rental rates and (iv) the anticipated durations of subleases. we use a credit-adjusted risk-free rate to discount the estimated cash flows.
we review our estimates and assumptions on at least a quarterly basis. we intend to continue such reviews until the termination of these facility lease obligations and will make whatever modifications we believe are necessary, based on our best judgment, to reflect any changed circumstances. our estimates have changed in the past, and may change in the future, resulting in additional adjustments to the estimate of these liabilities. changes to our estimate of these liabilities are recorded as additional restructuring expenses (credits). in addition, because our estimate of these liabilities includes the application of a discount rate to reflect the time-value of money, we record imputed interest costs related to these liabilities each quarter. these costs are included in restructuring expenses on our consolidated statements of operations.
stock-based compensation expense stock-based compensation expense is determined based on the fair value of the equity award at the grant date, net of estimated forfeitures, and is adjusted each period to reflect actual forfeitures and the outcomes of certain performance

conditions. for awards with performance conditions that accelerate vesting of the award, we estimate the likelihood of satisfaction of the performance conditions, which affects the period over which the expense is recognized, and recognize the expense using the accelerated attribution model. for awards with performance conditions in which the award does not vest unless the performance condition is met, we recognize expense only if we estimate that achievement of the performance condition is probable. if we conclude that vesting is probable, we recognize expense from the date that we reach this conclusion through the estimated vesting date. during 2016, we also granted awards with a variable number of awards. threshold, target and maximum parameters were established for the metric based half on financial and half on non-financial goals, and will be used to calculate the number of shares that will be issuable when the award vests, which may range from zero to 200% of the target amount. since 2014, we have provided to employees who have rendered a certain number of years of service and meet certain age requirements, partial or full acceleration of vesting of their equity awards, subject to certain conditions including a notification period, upon a termination of employment other than for cause. if actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates, if our estimates regarding the employees who will be eligible for partial or full acceleration of their equity awards, if the likelihood of achievement of a performance conditions changes or if any of our other assumptions or estimates prove incorrect, our stock-based compensation expense, or the period over which our stock-based compensation is recognized, could be materially affected.
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note a, "nature of business and accounting policies," in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. there were no new accounting pronouncements adopted during 2016 that had a material effect on our financial statements.

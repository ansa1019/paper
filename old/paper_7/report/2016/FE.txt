firstenergy corp.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations firstenergy's business firstenergy and its subsidiaries are principally involved in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. its reportable segments are as follows: regulated distribution, regulated transmission, and ces.
during the fourth quarter of 2016, firstenergy modified its segment reporting to reclassify the results of operations from certain transmission assets of me, pn and jcp&l, from the regulated distribution segment to the regulated transmission segment. costs associated with these transmission assets, which are currently included in me, pn, and jcp&l's stated rates, will be recovered through mait's and jcp&l's formula rates prospectively, once approved by ferc. the external segment reporting is consistent with the internal financial reports used by firstenergy's chief executive officer (its chief operating decision maker) to regularly assess performance of the business and allocate resources. disclosures for firstenergy's reportable operating segments for 2015 and 2014 have been revised to conform to the current presentation reflecting the operating activity of the identified transmission assets within regulated transmission.
the regulated distribution segment distributes electricity through firstenergy's ten utility operating companies, serving approximately six million customers within 65,000 square miles of ohio, pennsylvania, west virginia, maryland, new jersey and new york, and purchases power for its polr, sos, sso and default service requirements in ohio, pennsylvania, new jersey and maryland. this segment also controls 3,790 mws of regulated electric generation capacity located primarily in west virginia, virginia and new jersey. the segment's results reflect the commodity costs of securing electric generation and the deferral and amortization of certain fuel costs.
the service areas of, and customers served by, firstenergy's regulated distribution utilities are summarized below (in thousands):

the regulated transmission segment transmits electricity through transmission facilities owned and operated by atsi and trail and certain of firstenergy's utilities (jcp&l, me, pn, mp, pe and wp). this segment also includes the regulatory asset associated with the abandoned path project. the segment's revenues are primarily derived from forward-looking rates at atsi and trail, as well as stated transmission rates at certain of firstenergy's utilities. as discussed in "ferc matters" below, effective january 31, 2017, mait includes the transmission assets of me and pn, and jcp&l submitted applications to ferc requesting authorization to implement forward-looking formula transmission rates. those applications are pending before ferc. both the forward-looking and stated rates recover costs and provide a return on transmission capital investment. under the forward-looking rates, each of atsi's and trail's revenue requirement is updated annually based on a projected rate base and projected costs, which is subject to an annual true-up based on actual costs. except for the recovery of the path abandoned project regulatory asset, the segment's revenues are primarily from transmission services provided to lses pursuant to the pjm tariff. the segment's results also reflect the net transmission expenses related to the delivery of electricity on firstenergy's transmission facilities.
the ces segment, through fes and ae supply, primarily supplies electricity to end-use customers through retail and wholesale arrangements, including competitive retail sales to customers primarily in ohio, pennsylvania, illinois, michigan, new jersey and maryland, and the provision of partial polr and default service for some utilities in ohio, pennsylvania and maryland, including the utilities. as of december 31, 2016, this business segment controlled 13,162 mws of electric generating capacity, including, as further discussed below, 1,572 mws of natural gas and hydroelectric generating capacity subject to an asset purchase agreement with aspen and the 1,300 mw pleasants power station which was offered into mp's rfp process by ae supply. the ces segment's operating results are primarily derived from electric generation sales less the related costs of electricity generation, including fuel,
54
purchased power and net transmission (including congestion) and ancillary costs and capacity costs charged by pjm to deliver energy to the segment's customers, as well as other operating and maintenance costs, including costs incurred by fenoc.
corporate support not charged to fe's subsidiaries, interest expense on stand-alone holding company debt, corporate income taxes and other businesses that do not constitute an operating segment are categorized as corporate/other for reportable business segment purposes. additionally, reconciling adjustments for the elimination of inter-segment transactions are included in corporate/other. as of december 31, 2016, corporate/other had $4.2 billion of stand-alone holding company long-term debt, of which 28% was subject to variable-interest rates, and $2.7 billion was borrowed by fe under its revolving credit facility.
55
executive summary firstenergy believes having a combination of distribution, transmission and generation assets in a regulated or regulated-like construct is the best way to serve customers. firstenergy's strategy is to be a fully regulated utility, focusing on stable and predictable earnings and cash flow from its regulated business units.
over the past several years, ces has been impacted by a prolonged decrease in demand and excess generation supply in the pjm region, which has resulted in a period of protracted low power and capacity prices. to address this, ces sold or deactivated more than 6,770 mws of competitive generation from 2012 to 2015. additionally, ces has continued to focus on cost reductions, including those identified as part of firstenergy's previously disclosed cash flow improvement plan.
however, the energy and capacity markets continue to be weak, as evidenced by the significantly depressed capacity prices from the 2019/2020 pjm base residual auction in may of 2016 as well as the current forward pricing and the long-term fundamental view on energy and capacity prices, which resulted in a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $800 million ($23 million at fes) recognized in the second quarter of 2016 representing the total amount of goodwill at ces.
as part of a continual process to evaluate its overall generation business, on july 22, 2016, firstenergy announced its intent to exit the 136 mw bay shore unit 1 generating station by october 2020 and to deactivate units 1-4 of the w.h. sammis generating station totaling 720 mws by may 2020, resulting in a $647 million ($517 million at fes) non-cash pre-tax impairment charge in the second quarter of 2016. furthermore, in november of 2016, firstenergy announced that it had begun a strategic review of its competitive operations as it transitions to a fully regulated utility with a target to implement its exit from competitive operations by mid-2018.
as a result of this strategic review, firstenergy announced in january 2017 that ae supply and agc had entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell four of ae supply's natural gas generating plants and approximately 59% of agc's interest in bath county (1,572 mws of combined capacity) for an all cash purchase price of $925 million, subject to customary and other closing conditions as further discussed below under "competitive generation asset sale", including the satisfaction and discharge of $305 million of ae supply's senior notes, which is expected to require the payment of a "make-whole" premium currently estimated to be approximately $100 million based on current interest rates. additionally, in connection with mp's rfp seeking additional generation capacity, ae supply offered the pleasants power station (1,300 mws) for approximately $195 million. a winning bidder is expected to be announced in connection with the filing of appropriate applications for approval of the transactions with the wvpsc and ferc.
although firstenergy is targeting mid-2018 to exit from competitive operations, the options for the remaining portion of ces' generation are still uncertain, but could include one or more of the following:
•   legislative or regulatory solutions for generation assets that recognize their environmental or energy security benefits,
•   additional asset sales and/or plant deactivations,
•   restructuring fes debt with its creditors, and/or
•   seeking protection under u.s. bankruptcy laws for fes and possibly fenoc.
furthermore, adverse outcomes in previously disclosed disputes regarding long-term coal transportation contracts and/or the inability to extend or refinance debt maturities at fes subsidiaries, could accelerate management's targeted timeline and limit its options to exit competitive operations to either restructuring debt with its creditors or seeking protection under u.s. bankruptcy laws for fes and possibly fenoc.
as part of assessing the viability of strategic alternatives, firstenergy determined that the carrying value of long-lived assets of the competitive business were not recoverable, specifically given firstenergy's target to implement its exit from competitive operations by mid-2018, significantly before the end of their original useful lives, and the anticipated cash flows over this shortened period.  as a result, ces recorded a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $9,218 million ($8,082 million at fes) in the fourth quarter of 2016 to reduce the carrying value of certain assets to their estimated fair value, including long-lived assets such as generating plants and nuclear fuel, as well as other assets such as materials and supplies.
today, the competitive generation portfolio is comprised of more than 13,000 mws of generation, primarily from coal, nuclear and natural gas and oil fuel sources. the assets can generate approximately 70-75 million mwhs annually, with up to an additional five million mwhs available from purchased power agreements for wind, solar, and ces' entitlement in ovec, of which a portion is sold through various retail channels and the remainder targeting forward wholesale or spot sales. subject to the completion of the sale of the ae supply natural gas generating plants and agc's interest in bath county and, if accepted in the mp rfp process as the winning bidder, the transfer of the pleasants power station to mp, the size and generation capacity of ces' current portfolio will reduce to approximately 10,000 mws with approximately 60-65 million mwhs produced annually.
the competitive business continues to be managed conservatively due to the stress of weak energy prices, insufficient results from recent capacity auctions and anemic demand forecasts that have lowered the value of the business. furthermore, the credit quality
56
of ces, specifically fes' unsecured debt rating of caa1 at moody's, ccc+ at s&p and c at fitch and negative outlook from each of the rating agencies has challenged its ability to hedge generation with retail and forward wholesale sales due to collateral requirements that otherwise would reduce available liquidity. a lack of viable alternative strategies for its competitive portfolio has and would further stress the financial condition of fes. as a result, ces' contract sales are expected to decline from 53 million mwhs in 2016 to 40-45 million mwhs in 2017 and to 35-40 million mwhs in 2018. while the reduced contract sales will decrease potential collateral requirements, market price volatility may significantly impact ces' financial results due to the increased exposure to the wholesale spot market.
as previously disclosed, fes has $130 million of debt maturities that need to be refinanced in 2017 (and $515 million of maturing debt in 2018 beginning in the second quarter). based on its current senior unsecured debt rating and current capital structure, reflecting the impact of the impairment charges discussed above, as well as the forecasted decline in wholesale forward market prices over the next few years, these debt maturities will be difficult to refinance, even on a secured basis, which would further stress fes' anticipated liquidity. furthermore, lack of clarity regarding the timing and viability of alternative strategies, including additional asset sales or deactivations and/or converting generation from competitive operations to a regulated or regulated-like construct in a way that provides fes with the means to satisfy its obligations over the long-term, may require fes to restructure debt and other financial obligations with its creditors or seek protection under u.s bankruptcy laws.  in the event fes seeks protection under u.s. bankruptcy laws, fenoc may similarly seek such protection. although management is exploring capital and other cost reductions, asset sales, and other options to improve cash flow as well as continuing with legislative efforts to explore a regulatory solution, these obligations and their impact on liquidity raise substantial doubt about fes' ability to meet its obligations as they come due over the next twelve months and, as such, its ability to continue as a going concern.
as firstenergy continues to evaluate and implement the strategic review for its competitive operations, management continues to focus on its two regulated businesses - regulated transmission and regulated distribution - which focus on delivering enhanced customer service and reliability, strengthening grid and cyber-security and adding resiliency and operating flexibility to the transmission and distribution infrastructure as well as improving the reliability and efficiency of regulated distribution's generation capacity - all while delivering solid results.
together, the regulated transmission and distribution businesses provide stable, predictable earnings and cash flows to support fe's dividend. these regulated businesses are expected to provide 4%-6% compounded annual earnings growth from 2016 to 2019, which increases to 7%-9% with the inclusion of the dmr in ohio which was implemented on january 1, 2017 to support investment in modernization of the ohio companies' distribution systems.
with more than 24,000 miles in operations, the transmission system is the centerpiece of firstenergy's regulated investment strategy. rate base is expected to grow 9% over the next five years as the company plans to invest $4.2 to $5.8 billion in capital from 2017 to 2021 as part of its energizing the future transmission plan, which began as a $4.2 billion investment plan from 2014 through 2017 to upgrade firstenergy's transmission system.
these investments continue to be focused in the stand-alone transmission companies with effective and proposed forward-looking formula rates including atsi, trail, mait (which include the transmission assets of me and pn, effective january 31, 2017), and jcp&l. filings were made with ferc on october 28, 2016 to implement and transition to a forward-looking formula rate for mait's and jcp&l's transmission investments. firstenergy believes its existing transmission infrastructure creates incremental investment opportunities of approximately $20 billion beyond those identified through 2021 which will make the transmission system more reliable, robust, secure and resistant to extreme weather events, with improved operational flexibility. firstenergy plans to fund a portion of these investments with $500 million of equity annually from 2017 through 2019.
in addition to the significant opportunities at regulated transmission, the scale and diversity of the ten utilities that comprise the regulated distribution segment uniquely position this business unit for growth and represents an additional investment opportunity. in 2016, eight of the ten utilities completed rate proceedings which will provide benefits to the customers and communities those utilities serve while providing for additional growth opportunities, such as future investments in smart meter technology and electric system improvement projects to increase reliability and improve service to their customers as well as exploring future opportunities in customer engagement that focuses on the electrification of customers' homes and businesses by providing a full range of products and services.
although weather adjusted distribution deliveries through 2019 are forecasted to be flat as compared to 2016, regulated distribution's earnings over the next three years are anticipated to increase as a result of (i) the puco-approved esp iv, which includes $204 million in additional annual revenue pursuant to dmr which became effective january 1, 2017, (ii) the papuc-approved settlement agreements in the pennsylvania companies' base rate cases, which include approximately $290 million in aggregate additional annual revenue, effective january 27, 2017, and (iii) the njbpu-approved settlement in jcp&l's base rate case, which provides for an $80 million annual revenue increase effective january 1, 2017.
planned capital expenditures for regulated distribution are approximately $1.3 billion, annually for 2017 through 2019.

nm - not meaningful firstenergy's net loss in 2016 was $(6,177) million, or a basic and diluted loss of $(14.49) per share of common stock, compared with net income of $578 million, or basic and diluted earnings of $1.37 per share of common stock in 2015, and $299 million, or basic and diluted earnings of $0.71 per share of common stock in 2014. highlights of the key changes in year-over-year financial results are included below:
2016 compared with 2015
firstenergy's operating results in 2016 decreased $6,755 million as compared to 2015, primarily reflecting pre-tax impairment charges of $10,665 million recognized in 2016, as discussed in the "executive summary" above, including the following:
•   the impairment of $800 million of goodwill at ces in the second quarter of 2016, reflecting a weak outlook for energy and capacity markets.
•   impairment charges totaling $647 million in the second quarter of 2016 resulting from management's decision to exit the bay shore unit 1 generating station and units 1-4 of the w.h. sammis generating station.
•   impairment charges of $9,218 million resulting from management's plans to exit competitive operations by mid-2018 and the anticipated cash flows over this shortened period.
additionally, the company recognized valuation allowances against state and local nol carryforwards of $168 million as further discussed below.
58
firstenergy's 2016 revenues decreased $464 million as compared to the same period in 2015, resulting from a $835 million decrease at ces, partially offset by an increases of $47 million and $97 million at regulated distribution and regulated transmission, respectively.
•   the decrease in revenue at ces resulted from a 15 million mwh decline in contract sales, as the segment continues to align sales to its generation, as well as lower capacity revenue associated with lower capacity auction prices. the decline in contract sales volume was partially offset by higher wholesale sales and higher net gains on financially settled contracts.
•   the increase in revenue at regulated transmission primarily reflect recovery of incremental operating expenses and a higher rate base at atsi and trail, partially offset by adjustments associated with atsi and trail's annual rate filing for costs previously recovered as well as a lower roe in 2016 at atsi under its ferc-approved comprehensive settlement related to the implementation of its forward-looking rate.
•   the increase in revenue at regulated distribution primarily resulted from higher weather-related distribution deliveries and the full year impact of net rate increases implemented in 2015, partially offset by lower generation sales. distribution deliveries increased 0.3%, or 0.4 million mwhs, reflecting higher weather-related sales partially offset by the impact of lower weather-adjusted average customer usage reflecting the impact of more energy efficient products and services.
operating expenses increased $10,090 million in 2016 as compared to 2015, reflecting increases at ces of $9,799 million, primarily associated with the asset impairment charges discussed above, and regulated transmission of $77 million, partially offset by a decrease of $50 million at regulated distribution.
changes in certain operating expenses include the following:
•   purchased power decreased $505 million mainly due to lower volumes at ces and regulated distribution and lower capacity expense at ces.
•   fuel expense decreased $189 million mainly resulting from lower generation at ces associated with outages and lower economic dispatch of fossil units reflecting low wholesale spot market energy prices, as well as lower unit prices on fossil fuel contracts.
•   pension and opeb mark-to-market adjustments decreased $95 million to $147 million in 2016. the 2016 adjustment resulted from a 25 bps decrease in the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations partially offset by higher than expected asset returns and changes in certain actuarial assumptions.
•   other operating expenses increased $109 million, primarily reflecting an increase at regulated distribution resulting from the recognition of economic development and energy efficiency obligations in accordance with the puco's order approving the ohio companies' esp iv, higher network transmission expenses, which are recovered through transmission rates, higher retirement benefit costs, and higher operating and maintenance expenses associated with storm restoration costs, partially offset by lower pjm transmission costs and lower nuclear planned outage costs at ces.
other expense decreased $429 million, primarily due to the absence of a $362 million pre-tax impairment charge associated with fev's investment in global holding recognized in 2015 and lower otti on ndt investments.
firstenergy's 2016 effective tax rate was 33.1% on pre-tax losses as compared to 35.3% on pre-tax income in 2015. the change primarily relates to the $800 million impairment of goodwill, of which $433 million was non-deductible for tax purposes. additionally, $168 million of valuation allowances were recorded against state and local nol carryforwards and $78 million of valuation allowances were recorded against state and local property deferred tax assets, that management believes, more likely than not, will not be realized.
2015 compared with 2014
firstenergy's 2015 income from continuing operations increased $365 million as compared to 2014, resulting from a year-over-year improvement of $506 million at ces, $155 million at regulated distribution and $73 million at regulated transmission.
in 2015, firstenergy's revenues decreased $23 million as compared to 2014, primarily resulting from a $905 million decrease at ces partially offset by a $528 million increase at regulated distribution and a $237 million increase at regulated transmission.
•   the decrease in revenue at ces resulted from a 31 million mwhs decline in contract sales, in line with ces' strategy to align sales to its generation, partially offset by higher wholesale sales, including increased capacity revenue associated with higher capacity auction prices.
•   the increase in revenue at regulated distribution resulted from the implementation of new rates at certain operating companies as well as a year-over-year increase in generation revenue. distribution deliveries decreased 0.8%, or 1.1 million mwhs, as weather adjusted sales declined as a result of energy efficiency products and services and decreases in certain industrial sectors, partially offset by an increase in weather-related sales.
•   the increase at regulated transmission primarily reflected a higher rate base and recovery of incremental operating expenses as well as atsi's transition to a forward-looking rate, effective january 1, 2015. these increases were partially offset by a lower roe at atsi in the last six months of 2015 as part of its ferc-approved settlement discussed above.
operating expenses decreased $1,253 million in 2015 as compared to 2014, including a $593 million decrease in the company's pension and opeb mark-to-market adjustment, reflecting a decrease at ces of $1,747 million, partially offset by increases at regulated distribution and regulated transmission of $257 million and $71 million, respectively.
59
changes in certain operating expenses include the following:
•   fuel expense declined $425 million, primarily at ces, resulting from lower fossil generation associated with low energy prices, lower unit costs, and lower settlement and termination charges on fuel and transportation contracts.
•   purchased power decreased $398 million, primarily reflecting lower volumes at ces, resulting from lower contract sales, partially offset by higher volumes at regulated distribution due to lower customer shopping as discussed above, and higher capacity expense associated with higher capacity rates.
•   other operating expenses decreased $213 million, primarily reflecting a decrease at ces associated with lower pjm transmission costs and retail-related costs partially offset by higher nuclear planned outage costs. regulated distribution other operating expenses increased $163 million resulting from higher network transmission expenses, which are recovered through transmission rates, and higher operating and maintenance expenses associated with reliability improvements.
•   amortization of regulatory assets, net increased $256 million primarily reflecting the recovery of deferred costs, including storm costs, associated with the implementation of new rates discussed above.
firstenergy's other expenses increased $508 million, or 57%, year-over-year, primarily resulting from a $362 million pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge associated with fev's investment in global holding, lower investment income, including a $65 million increase in otti on ndt investments, and higher interest expense associated with higher average debt levels.
firstenergy's effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 35.3% in 2015 compared to (24.6)% in 2014. the increase in the effective tax rate was attributable to tax planning initiatives executed during 2014, including tax benefits associated with an irs approved change in accounting method for costs associated with the refurbishment of meters and transformers and the expiration of the statute of limitations on uncertain state tax positions. additionally, during 2014, firstenergy recognized a reduction in income tax expense of $25 million that related to prior periods resulting from adjustments to its tax basis balance sheet.

results of operations the financial results discussed below include revenues and expenses from transactions among firstenergy's business segments. a reconciliation of segment financial results is provided in note 19, segment information, of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements. certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
during the fourth quarter of 2016, firstenergy modified its segment reporting to reclassify the results of operations from certain transmission assets of me, pn and jcp&l, from the regulated distribution segment to the regulated transmission segment. costs associated with these transmission assets, which are currently included in me, pn, and jcp&l's stated rates, will be recovered through mait's and jcp&l's formula rates prospectively, once approved by ferc. the external segment reporting is consistent with the internal financial reports used by firstenergy's chief executive officer (its chief operating decision maker) to regularly assess performance of the business and allocate resources. disclosures for firstenergy's reportable operating segments for 2015 and 2014 have been revised to conform to the current presentation reflecting the operating activity of the identified transmission assets within regulated transmission.

regulated distribution - 2016 compared with 2015
regulated distribution's net income increased $63 million in 2016 compared to 2015, including a $78 million decrease in its pension and opeb mark-to-market adjustment, partially offset by regulatory charges of $51 million resulting from the puco's march 31, 2016 opinion and order adopting and approving, with modifications, the ohio companies' esp iv. excluding the impact of these adjustments, year-over-year earnings reflect higher distribution deliveries and the full year impact of net rate increases implemented in 2015 as a result of approved rate cases at certain of the utilities, as further described below, partially offset by higher retirement benefit costs and other operating expenses.

distribution services revenues increased $275 million primarily resulting from the full year impact of approved base distribution rate increases at the pennsylvania companies, effective may 3, 2015, and mp and pe in west virginia, effective february 25, 2015, partially offset by a distribution rate decrease at jcp&l, including the recovery of 2011 and 2012 storm costs, effective april 1, 2015. additionally, distribution revenues were impacted by higher rates associated with the recovery of deferred costs as well as higher weather-related usage, as described below. distribution deliveries by customer class are summarized in the following table:

higher distribution deliveries to residential and commercial customers reflect increased weather-related usage resulting from cooling degree days that were 18% above 2015, and 37% above normal, partially offset by heating degree days that were 6% below 2015, and 9% below normal. additionally, distribution deliveries to residential and commercial customers were impacted by declining average customer usage associated with more energy efficient products and services. year-to-date deliveries to industrial customers declined slightly as the increase from shale customer usage was more than offset by a decrease from steel and chemical customer usage.

decrease in generation revenues                        $(260        )
the decrease in retail generation sales volumes was primarily due to increased customer shopping in ohio, pennsylvania, and new jersey. total generation provided by alternative suppliers as a percentage of total mwh deliveries increased to 83% from 80% for the ohio companies, to 67% from 65% for the pennsylvania companies and to 51% from 50% for jcp&l. the increase in retail generation prices primarily resulted from an enec rate increase in west virginia, effective january 1, 2016, partially offset by lower default service auction prices in ohio and pennsylvania.
wholesale generation revenues decreased $76 million in 2016 compared to the same period of 2015, primarily due to lower spot market energy prices, partially offset by higher wholesale sales. the difference between current wholesale generation revenues and certain energy costs incurred is deferred for future recovery or refund, with no material impact to earnings.
other revenues increased $32 million, primarily related to a $29 million gain on the sale of oil and gas rights at wp.
operating expenses -
total operating expenses decreased $50 million primarily due to the following:
•   fuel expense increased $34 million in 2016, as compared to the same period of 2015, primarily related to higher generation.
•   purchased power costs decreased $275 million in 2016, as compared to the same period of 2015, primarily due to lower volumes resulting from increased customer shopping, as described above, as well as lower unit costs reflecting lower default service auction prices in ohio and pennsylvania.

•   other operating expenses increased $196 million primarily due to:
•   an increase of $51 million resulting from the recognition of economic development and energy efficiency obligations in accordance with the puco's march 31, 2016 opinion and order adopting and approving, with modifications, the ohio companies' esp iv.
•   higher retirement benefit costs of $57 million.
•   higher transmission expenses of $56 million primarily related to an increase in network transmission expenses at the ohio companies, partially offset by lower congestion expenses at mp. the difference between current revenues and transmission costs incurred are deferred for future recovery or refund, resulting in no material impact on current period earnings.
•   higher operating and maintenance expense of $33 million, primarily due to increased storm restoration costs, which are deferred for future recovery resulting in no material impact on current period earnings.
•   pension and opeb mark-to-market adjustments decreased $78 million to $101 million in 2016. the 2016 adjustment resulted from a 25 bps decrease in the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations partially offset by higher than expected asset returns and changes in certain actuarial assumptions.
•   depreciation expenses increased $12 million due to a higher asset base.
•   net amortization of regulatory assets increased $52 million primarily due to:
•   a full year recovery of storm costs in new jersey, pennsylvania, and west virginia, effective with the implementation of new rates as discussed above ($35 million),
•   recovery of west virginia vegetation management program costs ($40 million), partially offset by
•   higher deferral of storm restoration costs ($39 million).
•   general taxes increased $17 million primarily due to higher revenue-related taxes in pennsylvania and higher property taxes in ohio.
other expense -
total other expense decreased $16 million primarily related to lower interest expense resulting from various debt maturities at jcp&l and oe in 2016.
income taxes -
regulated distribution's effective tax rate was 36.5% and 35.6% for 2016 and 2015, respectively.
regulated transmission - 2016 compared with 2015
net income increased $3 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily resulting from a higher rate base, partially offset by adjustments associated with atsi and trail's annual rate filing for costs previously recovered, a lower return on equity at atsi, and lower capitalized financing costs.
revenues -
total revenues increased $97 million principally due to recovery of incremental operating expenses and a higher rate base at atsi and trail, partially offset by adjustments associated with atsi's and trail's annual rate filing for costs previously recovered as well as a lower roe at atsi under its ferc-approved comprehensive settlement related to the implementation of its forward-looking rate effective january 1, 2015.

operating expenses -
total operating expenses increased $77 million principally due to higher property taxes and depreciation expense at atsi, which are recovered through atsi's forward-looking formula rate.
other expenses -
other expense increased $21 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to lower capitalized financing costs resulting from lower construction work in progress balances at atsi as well as increased interest expense resulting from a long-term debt issuance of $150 million at atsi in the fourth quarter of 2015, the proceeds of which, in part, paid off short-term borrowings.
income taxes -
regulated transmission's effective tax rate was 36.1% and 36.8% for 2016 and 2015, respectively.
ces - 2016 compared with 2015
operating results decreased $7,008 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily resulting from pre-tax asset impairment charges of $10,665 million discussed above, partially offset by lower mark-to-market gains on commodity contract positions, a lower pension and opeb mark-to-market adjustment and lower settlement and termination costs related to coal contracts. excluding these items, year-over-year operating results were impacted by lower capacity revenues, lower sales volumes, a termination charge associated with an fes customer contract, and higher retirement and employee benefit costs, partially offset by lower fuel costs, reduced transmission expenses, and lower purchased power.
revenues -
total revenues decreased $835 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to decreased sales volumes and lower capacity revenue, partially offset by higher net gains on financially settled contracts and an increase in short-term (net hourly position) transactions, as further described below.

lower sales volumes in the direct, governmental aggregation and mass market sales channels primarily reflects the continuation of fes' strategy to more effectively hedge its generation, as discussed above. the direct, governmental aggregation, and mass market customer base was 1.1 million as of december 31, 2016, compared to 1.6 million as of december 31, 2015. although unit pricing was lower year-over-year in the direct and governmental aggregation channels, the decrease was primarily attributable to lower capacity expenses, as discussed below, which is a component of the retail price.
the decrease in polr sales of $129 million was primarily due to lower volumes. structured sales decreased $95 million, primarily due to the impact of lower market prices and lower structured transaction volumes.
wholesale revenues increased $232 million, primarily due to an increase in short-term (net hourly position) transactions and higher net gains on financially settled contracts, partially offset by a decrease in capacity revenue from lower capacity auction prices and lower spot market energy prices.
transmission revenue decreased $65 million, primarily due to lower congestion revenue associated with less volatile market conditions.
other revenue decreased $27 million, primarily due to the absence of a gain on the sale of property to a regulated affiliate in 2015 and lower lease revenues from the expiration of a nuclear sale-leaseback agreement.
operating expenses -
total operating expenses increased $9,799 million in 2016 due to the following:
•   fuel costs decreased $223 million, primarily due to lower generation associated with outages and lower economic dispatch of fossil units resulting from low wholesale spot market energy prices, as discussed above, as well as lower unit prices on fossil fuel contracts. additionally, fuel costs were impacted by lower settlement and termination costs on coal contracts. the impact of settlements and terminations of coal contracts resulted in a pre-tax loss of $58 million and $67 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
69
•   purchased power costs decreased $437 million due to lower capacity expenses ($234 million) and lower volumes ($203 million). the decrease in capacity expense, which is a component of ces' retail price, was primarily the result of lower contract sales and lower capacity rates associated with ces' retail sales obligations. lower volumes primarily resulted from lower contract sales, as discussed above, partially offset by higher economic purchases, resulting from the low wholesale spot market price environment.
•   fossil operating costs increased $4 million, primarily due to increased outage costs and higher employee benefit costs, partially offset by lower operating costs from the deactivation of certain fossil plants in april 2015.
•   nuclear operating costs decreased $39 million, primarily as a result of lower refueling outage costs, partially offset by higher employee benefit costs. there were two refueling outages in 2016 as compared to three refueling outages in 2015.
•   retirement benefit costs increased $31 million.
•   transmission expenses decreased $175 million, primarily due to lower congestion and market-based ancillary costs associated with less volatile market conditions as compared to 2015, as well as lower load requirements.
•   other operating expenses increased $35 million, primarily due to lower mark-to-market gains on commodity contract positions of $84 million and a $37 million charge associated with the termination of an fes customer contract, partially offset by lower lease expense as a result of the expiration of a nuclear sale-leaseback agreement.
•   pension and opeb mark-to-market adjustments decreased $15 million to $45 million in 2016. the 2016 adjustment resulted from a 25 bps decrease in the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations, partially offset by higher than expected asset returns and changes in other actuarial assumptions.
•   depreciation expense decreased $7 million, primarily as a result of an out-of-period adjustment to reduce depreciation of a hydroelectric generating station, partially offset by a higher asset base.
•   general taxes decreased $6 million, primarily due to lower gross receipts taxes associated with lower retail sales volumes.
•   impairment of assets increased $10,631 million, primarily due to impairments of goodwill and the competitive generation assets discussed above.
other expense -
total other expense decreased $78 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower otti on ndt investments.
income taxes (benefits) -
ces' effective tax rate was 33.6% on pre-tax losses and 36.0% on pre-tax income for 2016 and 2015, respectively. the change in the effective tax rate is primarily due to $168 million of valuation allowances recorded against state and local nol carryforwards and $78 million of valuation allowances recorded against state and local property deferred tax assets, that management believes, more likely than not, will not be realized, as well as the impairment of $800 million of goodwill, of which $433 million is non-deductible for tax purposes.
corporate/other - 2016 compared with 2015
financial results and reconciling items included in corporate/other resulted in a $187 million increase in net income in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the absence of a $362 million pre-tax impairment of firstenergy's equity method investment in global holding recognized in 2015. excluding the impact of this adjustment, year-over-year results were impacted by higher operating and maintenance costs, higher interest expense and changes in the consolidated effective tax rate, which for 2016 was 33.1% on pre-tax losses and for 2015 was 35.5% on pre-tax income. the increased interest expense primarily relates to debt redemption costs related to the fe revolving credit facility and term loans, as discussed in "capital resources and liquidity". the higher consolidated effective tax rate primarily resulted from the absence of tax benefits recognized in 2015 associated with an irs-approved change in accounting method that increased the tax basis in certain assets resulting in higher future tax deductions, as well as from changes in state apportionment factors.

regulated distribution - 2015 compared with 2014
regulated distribution's net income increased $155 million in 2015 compared to 2014, including a $327 million decrease in its pension and opeb mark-to-market adjustment. excluding the impact of this adjustment, year-over-year earnings were impacted by increased operating expenses, including higher reliability maintenance expenses, higher benefit costs, and higher depreciation associated with increased capital investments, and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by a net increase in new rates implemented in 2015 at certain of the utilities.

increase in generation revenues                           $82
the increase in retail generation sales volume was primarily due to lower customer shopping in ohio, pennsylvania, and new jersey and an increase in weather-related usage, partially offset by the impacts of energy efficiency as described above. total generation provided by alternative suppliers as a percentage of total mwh deliveries decreased to 80% from 81% for the ohio companies, 65% from 67% for the pennsylvania companies and 50% from 52% for jcp&l. the increase in prices primarily resulted from higher default service auction prices.
wholesale generation revenue decreased $178 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily reflecting decreased volume associated with the termination of certain nug contracts at jcp&l and pn and lower economic dispatch of fossil generating units associated with low spot market energy prices. partially offsetting the decrease was an increase in capacity revenue resulting from higher capacity prices. the difference between current wholesale generation revenues and certain energy costs incurred are deferred for future recovery, with no material impact on earnings.
operating expenses -
total operating expenses increased $257 million primarily due to the following:
•   fuel expense decreased $34 million in 2015 primarily related to lower economic dispatch resulting from low spot market energy prices.
•   purchased power costs were $163 million higher in 2015 primarily due to increased volumes reflecting lower customer shopping as described above, higher unit costs related to higher default service auction prices, and higher capacity expense at mp, partially offset by lower volumes resulting from the termination of certain nug contracts at jcp&amp;l and pn.

other operating expenses increased $163 million primarily due to:
•   higher transmission expenses of $73 million primarily due to an increase in network transmission expenses at the ohio companies, partially offset by lower congestion expenses at mp. the differences between current retail transmission revenues and transmission costs incurred are deferred for future recovery, resulting in no material impact on current period earnings.
•   increased regulated generation operating and maintenance expenses of $7 million, reflecting higher planned outage expenses in 2015 compared to 2014.
•   higher retirement benefit costs of $22 million.
•   higher distribution operating and maintenance expenses of $61 million, reflecting increased reliability maintenance and other employee benefit costs, partially offset by lower storm restoration costs.
•   pension and opeb mark-to-market adjustments decreased $327 million to $179 million, which was impacted by lower than expected asset returns, partially offset by an increase in the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations.
•   depreciation expense increased $13 million due to a higher asset base, partially offset by lower depreciation rates at jcp&amp;l effective with the implementation of new rates from its distribution base rate case as well as lower depreciation rates in pennsylvania based on updated asset life studies approved by the ppuc.
•   net regulatory asset amortization increased $260 million primarily due to:
•   recovery of storm costs in new jersey, pennsylvania, and west virginia effective with the implementation of new rates as discussed above ($66 million),
•   higher energy efficiency program cost recovery ($66 million),
•   lower deferral of tts costs in west virginia ($37 million),
•   higher amortizations of above-market nug costs in pennsylvania and new jersey ($36 million),
•   lower deferral of west virginia vegetation management expenses ($31 million),
•   higher default generation service cost amortization ($28 million), and
•   recovery of pennsylvania legacy meter costs ($22 million); partially offset by
•   higher cost deferral of ohio network transmission expenses ($33 million).
•   general taxes increased $11 million primarily due to higher revenue-related taxes in pennsylvania, partially offset by lower property taxes in ohio.
other expense -
other expense was flat in 2015 as compared to 2014, as lower investment income was offset by lower interest expense and higher capitalized financing costs.
income taxes -
regulated distribution's effective tax rate was 35.6% and 32.6% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increase in the effective tax rate resulted from changes in state apportionment factors and tax benefits recognized in 2014.
regulated transmission - 2015 compared with 2014
net income increased $73 million in 2015 compared to 2014. higher transmission revenues associated with atsi's "forward looking" rate and higher rate base were partially offset by higher interest expense and lower capitalized financing costs.
revenues -
total revenues increased $237 million principally at atsi and trail, reflecting recovery of incremental operating expenses and a higher rate base. effective january 1, 2015, atsi's formula rate transitioned to a "forward looking" approach, where transmission revenues are based on actual costs.

operating expenses -
total operating expenses increased $71 million principally due to higher operating and maintenance expenses, depreciation, and property taxes at atsi, which are recovered through atsi's "forward looking" rate.
other expenses -
other expenses increased $41 million due to increased interest expense resulting from debt issuances of $1.0 billion at fet and $400 million at atsi, the proceeds of which, in part, paid off short term borrowings as well as lower capitalized financing costs.
income taxes -
regulated transmission's effective tax rate was 36.8% and 35.3% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increase in the effective tax rate resulted from changes in state apportionment factors and tax benefits recognized in 2014.
ces - 2015 compared with 2014
operating results increased $420 million in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily from higher capacity revenues and the absence of the impact of the high market prices associated with extreme weather events and unplanned outages in 2014 that resulted in higher purchased power and transmission costs, partially offset by lower contract sales volumes. additionally, changes in year-over-year operating results were impacted by lower pension and opeb mark-to-market adjustments, lower settlement and termination costs related to coal and transportation contracts, and the absence of a $78 million after-tax gain on the sale of certain hydroelectric facilities recognized in february 2014.
revenues -
total revenues decreased $905 million in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to decreased sales volumes. revenues were also impacted by higher unit prices compared to 2014 as a result of increased channel pricing, as well as higher capacity revenues, as further described below.

governmental aggregation, and mass market channels, the increase was primarily attributable to higher capacity expense as discussed below, which is a component of the retail price, partially offset by a lower energy component of the retail price resulting from lower year-over-year market prices. the direct, governmental aggregation and mass market customer base was 1.6 million as of december 31, 2015, compared to 2.1 million as of december 31, 2014.
the decrease in polr sales of $190 million was due to lower volumes, partially offset by higher rates associated with polr auctions. structured sales increased $36 million due to low market prices that increased the gains on various structured financial sales contracts and higher structured transaction volumes.
wholesale revenues increased $764 million, primarily due to an increase in capacity revenue from capacity auctions, increase in short-term (net hourly position) transactions, and higher net gains on financially settled contracts, partially offset by lower spot market energy prices, which limited additional wholesale sales.
transmission revenue decreased $82 million, primarily due to lower congestion revenue resulting from the market conditions associated with the extreme weather events in 2014.
other revenue increased $16 million, primarily due to a gain on the sale of property to a regulated affiliate in 2015 and higher lease revenues from additional equity interests in affiliated sale and leasebacks repurchased in november 2014. ces earns lease revenue associated with the equity interests it purchased.
operating expenses -
total operating expenses decreased $1,747 million in 2015 due to the following:
•   fuel costs decreased $391 million, primarily due to lower economic dispatch of fossil units resulting from low spot market energy prices and lower nuclear unit prices, resulting from the suspension of the doe nuclear disposal fee, effective may 16, 2014. additionally, fuel costs were impacted by a decrease in settlement and termination costs related to coal and transportation contracts. the impact of terminations and settlements of coal and transportation contracts resulted in a pre-tax loss of $67 million and $166 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
•   purchased power costs decreased $694 million due to lower volumes ($888 million), partially offset by higher unit prices ($39 million) and higher capacity expenses ($155 million). lower volumes were primarily due to decreased load requirements resulting from lower sales, as discussed above, partially offset by lower fossil generation, as discussed above. the higher unit prices are primarily due to higher losses on financially settled contracts, partially offset by lower market prices in 2015 as compared to 2014. the increase in capacity expense, which is a component of ces' retail price, was primarily the result of higher capacity rates associated with ces' retail sales obligations.
•   nuclear operating costs increased $84 million as a result of higher refueling outage costs and higher employee benefit expenses. there were three refueling outages in 2015 as compared to two refueling outages in 2014.
•   transmission expenses decreased $273 million, primarily due to lower operating reserve and market-based ancillary costs associated with market conditions resulting from the extreme weather events in 2014.
•   general taxes decreased $31 million, primarily due to lower gross receipts taxes associated with lower retail sales volumes.
•   pension and opeb mark-to-market adjustments decreased $267 million to $60 million, which was impacted by lower than expected asset returns, partially offset by an increase in the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations.
•   other operating expenses decreased $216 million, primarily due to a $141 million decrease in mark-to-market expenses on commodity contract positions reflecting lower market prices and a $71 million decrease in retail-related costs.
•   impairment of assets were $34 million in 2015 due to impairment charges associated with non-core assets.
other expense -
total other expense increased $63 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher otti on ndt investments, partially offset by the absence of an $8 million loss on debt redemptions in 2014.
discontinued operations -
there were no discontinued operations in 2015. in 2014, discontinued operations primarily included a pre-tax gain of approximately $142 million ($78 million after-tax) associated with the sale of certain hydroelectric assets on february 12, 2014.
79
income tax (benefits) -
ces' effective tax rate was 36.0% and 34.8% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increase in the effective tax rate resulted from changes in state apportionment factors and realized tax benefits recognized in 2014.
corporate/other - 2015 compared with 2014
financial results and reconciling items included in corporate/other resulted in a $369 million decrease in net income in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a $362 million pre-tax impairment of firstenergy's equity method investment in global holding, higher costs associated with environmental remediation at legacy plants, higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. during 2015, based on the significant decline in coal pricing and the current outlook for the coal market, firstenergy assessed the carrying value of its investment in global holding and determined there was an other than temporary decline in the fair value below its carrying value, which resulted in the impairment charge. the increased interest expense primarily relates to fe's $1 billion term loan entered into in march 2014 and the absence of a gain on the termination of interest rate swaps in 2014. the higher effective tax rate primarily resulted from the absence of tax benefits recognized in 2014 associated with an irs-approved change in accounting method that increased the tax basis in certain assets resulting in higher future tax deductions, a reduction in state deferred tax liabilities resulting from changes in state apportionment factors, the elimination of certain tax liabilities associated with basis differences as well as certain tax benefits recorded in 2014 that related to prior periods.
regulatory assets regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because of their probable future recovery from customers through regulated rates. regulatory liabilities represent amounts that are expected to be credited to customers through future regulated rates or amounts collected from customers for costs not yet incurred. firstenergy and the utilities net their regulatory assets and liabilities based on federal and state jurisdictions. the following table provides information about the composition of net regulatory assets as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, and the changes during the year ended december 31, 2016:

regulatory assets that do not earn a current return totaled approximately $153 million and $148 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily related to storm damage costs, and are currently being recovered through rates.
as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, firstenergy had approximately $157 million and $116 million of net regulatory liabilities that are primarily related to asset removal costs. net regulatory liabilities are classified within other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

capital resources and liquidity firstenergy's business is capital intensive, requiring significant resources to fund operating expenses, construction expenditures, scheduled debt maturities and interest payments, dividend payments, and contributions to its pension plan.
fe, and its utility and transmission subsidiaries, expect their existing sources of liquidity to remain sufficient to meet their respective anticipated obligations. in addition to internal sources to fund liquidity and capital requirements for 2017 and beyond, fe and its utility and transmission subsidiaries expect to rely on external sources of funds. short-term cash requirements not met by cash provided from operations are generally satisfied through short-term borrowings. long-term cash needs, including cash requirements to fund regulated transmission's capital program, may be met through a combination of an additional $500 million of equity in each year 2017 through 2019, and new long-term debt, in each case, subject to market conditions and other factors. firstenergy also expects to issue long-term debt at certain utilities to, among other things, refinance short-term and maturing long-term debt, subject to market conditions and other factors.
firstenergy's unregulated subsidiaries, specifically fes and ae supply, expect to rely on, in the case of ae supply, internal sources, the unregulated companies' money pool, and proceeds generated from previously disclosed asset sales, subject to closing, and with respect to fes, a two-year secured line of credit with fe of up to $500 million, as further described below. additionally, fes subsidiaries have debt maturities in 2017 and 2018 of $130 million and $515 million, respectively. the inability to refinance such debt maturities could cause fes to take one or more of the following actions: (i) restructuring of debt and other financial obligations, (ii) additional borrowings under its credit facility with fe, (iii) further asset sales or plant deactivations, and/or (iv) seek protection under u.s. bankruptcy laws. in the event fes seeks such protection, fenoc may similarly seek protection under u.s. bankruptcy laws.
in 2016, firstenergy satisfied its minimum required funding obligations of $382 million and addressed funding obligations for future years to its qualified pension plan with total contributions of $882 million (of which $138 million was cash contributions from fes), including $500 million of fe common stock contributed to the qualified pension plan on december 13, 2016.

firstenergy's strategy is to focus on investments in its regulated operations. the centerpiece of this strategy is the energizing the future transmission plan, which firstenergy plans to invest $4.2 to $5.8 billion in capital investments from 2017 to 2021, and began as a $4.2 billion investment plan from 2014 through 2017 to upgrade firstenergy's transmission system. this program is focused on projects that enhance system performance, physical security and add operating flexibility and capacity starting with the atsi system and moving east across firstenergy's service territory over time. through 2016, firstenergy's capital expenditures under this plan were $3.4 billion. in total, firstenergy has identified over $20 billion in transmission investment opportunities across the 24,000 mile transmission system, making this a continuing platform for investment in the years beyond 2021.
additionally, planned capital expenditures in 2019 for regulated distribution are approximately $1.3 billion primarily to enhance the utilities' distribution systems.
in alignment with firstenergy's strategy to invest in its regulated transmission and regulated distribution segments as it transitions to a fully regulated company, firstenergy is also focused on improving the balance sheet over time consistent with its business profile and maintaining investment grade ratings at its regulated businesses and fe. specifically, at the regulated businesses, authority has been obtained for various regulated distribution and transmission subsidiaries to issue and/or refinance debt.
any financing plans by fe or any of its subsidiaries, including the issuance of equity and debt, and the refinancing of short-term and maturing long-term debt are subject to market conditions and other factors, such as the impact of the current energy and capacity markets and potential credit rating changes. no assurance can be given that any such issuances, financing or refinancing, as the case may be, will be completed as anticipated or at all. any delay in the completion of financing plans could require fe or any of its subsidiaries to utilize short-term borrowing capacity, which could impact available liquidity. in particular, fes may borrow under its credit facility with fe, to the extent available, to refinance debt maturities and mandatory purchase obligations, which would impact available liquidity for fes and, fe to the extent it funds any such borrowings through its facility and/or cash. in addition, fe and its subsidiaries expect to continually evaluate any planned financings, which may result in changes from time to time.

as of december 31, 2016, firstenergy's net deficit in working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was due in large part to currently payable long-term debt and short-term borrowings. currently payable long-term debt as of december 31, 2016, included the following:

short-term borrowings / revolving credit facilities on december 6, 2016, fe and certain subsidiaries entered into new five-year syndicated credit facilities available through december 6, 2021, and concurrently terminated existing syndicated credit facilities that were to expire march 31, 2019, as follows:
•   fe and the utilities entered into a new $4 billion revolving credit facility, which represents an increase of $500 million over the existing $3.5 billion facility it replaced,
•   fet and its subsidiaries entered into a $1 billion revolving credit facility, which replaced their existing $1 billion facility, and
•   fes and ae supply terminated their unsecured $1.5 billion credit facility (commitments of $900 million and $600 million for fes and ae supply, respectively) and fes entered into a new, two-year secured credit facility with fe in which fe provided a committed line of credit to fes of up to $500 million and additional credit support of up to $200 million to cover a $169 million surety bond for the benefit of the pa dep with respect to lbr, and other bonds as designated in writing to fe. in connection with the cancellation of the prior fes/ae supply facility and entry into the new fes secured facility with fe, certain commitments and amendments associated with shared services and operational matters were made including, without limitation, as follows: (i) fe reaffirmed its obligations under the intercompany tax allocation agreement, and (ii) amendments to the service agreement by and among fesc, fes, fg and ng, to prevent termination until the earlier of december 31, 2018, or a change in control of fes or its subsidiaries.
fe, the utilities and fet and its subsidiaries may use borrowings under their new facilities for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including intercompany loans and advances by a borrower to any of its subsidiaries. fes expects to use its new facility with fe to conduct its ordinary course of business in lieu of borrowing under the unregulated money pool. the new facility matures on december 31, 2018, and is secured by fmbs issued by fg ($250 million) and ng ($450 million).
under the terms of the new fe and fet credit facilities, each borrower is required to maintain a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio, as defined, of no more than 0.65 to 1.00, or in the case of fet, 0.75 to 1.00. for purposes of calculating its ratio, fe is permitted certain adjustments to total capitalization including (i) an exclusion for certain previously incurred after-tax, non-cash write-downs and non-cash charges of approximately $2.75 billion and (ii) a new exclusion for additional after-tax, non-cash write-downs and non-cash charges up to $5.5 billion related to asset impairments attributable to the power generation assets owned by fes, ae supply and each of their subsidiaries. additionally, under the new credit facility, fe is now also required to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 1.75 to 1.00 until december 31, 2017, 2.00 to 1.00 beginning january 1, 2018 until december 31, 2018, 2.25 to 1.00 beginning january 1, 2019 until december 31, 2019, and 2.50 to 1.00 beginning january 1, 2020 until december 31, 2021. fe and each of the other borrowers under the new fe and fet credit facilities are currently in compliance with these financial covenants. in the case of fe, the impairment charges recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016 described above are excluded from fe's calculation of total capitalization pursuant to the new $5.5 billion after-tax exclusion referenced in (ii) above consistent with the terms of the facility. other terms of the new fe credit facility exclude fes and ae supply from the definition of "significant subsidiaries," which removes them from fe's covenants and defaults resulting from adverse judgments in excess of $100 million and eliminates lender approvals previously required for fes and ae supply asset sales.
outstanding alternate base rate advances under the new fe and fet facilities will bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum equal to the sum of an applicable margin for alternate base rate advances determined by reference to the applicable borrower's then-current senior unsecured non-credit enhanced debt ratings (reference ratings) plus the highest of (i) the "prime rate" published by the wall street journal from time to time, (ii) the sum of 1/2 of 1% per annum plus the federal funds rate in effect from time to time and (iii) the libor for a one-month interest period plus 1%. outstanding eurodollar rate advances will bear interest at libor for interest periods of one week or one, two, three or six months plus an applicable margin determined by reference to the applicable borrower's reference ratings. swing line loans under the new fe facility will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the alternate base rate plus an applicable margin determined by reference to the applicable borrower's reference ratings. changes in reference ratings of a borrower would lower or raise its applicable margin depending on whether ratings improved or were lowered, respectively.

the facilities do not contain provisions that restrict the ability to borrow or accelerate payment of outstanding advances in the event of any change in credit ratings of the borrowers. pricing is defined in "pricing grids," whereby the cost of funds borrowed under the facilities is related to the credit ratings of the company borrowing the funds, other than the fet facility, which is based on its subsidiaries' credit ratings. additionally, borrowings under each of the facilities are subject to the usual and customary provisions for acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default, including a cross-default for other indebtedness in excess of $100 million.
as of december 31, 2016, the borrowers were in compliance with the applicable debt to total capitalization ratio covenants as well as in the case of fe, the minimum interest coverage ratio requirement, in each case as defined under the respective facilities. in the case of fe, the impairment charges recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016 disclosed above are excluded from fe's calculation of total capitalization pursuant to the new exclusion referenced in (ii) above consistent with the terms of the facility.
term loans on december 6, 2016, fe terminated its existing $1 billion and $200 million term loan credit agreements and entered into a new $1.2 billion five-year syndicated term loan credit agreement. the term loan contains covenants and other terms and conditions substantially similar to those of the fe revolving credit facility described above, including a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio requirement.
the initial borrowing under the new $1.2 billion fe term loan, which took the form of a eurodollar rate advance, may be converted from time to time, in whole or in part, to alternate base rate advances or other eurodollar rate advances. outstanding alternate base rate advances will bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum equal to the sum of an applicable margin for alternate base rate advances determined by reference to fe's reference ratings plus the highest of (i) the administrative agent's publicly-announced "prime rate", (ii) the sum of 1/2 of 1% per annum plus the federal funds rate in effect from time to time and (iii) the rate of interest per annum appearing on a nationally-recognized service such as the dow jones market service (telerate) equal to one-month libor on each day plus 1%. outstanding eurodollar rate advances will bear interest at libor for interest periods of one week or one, two, three or six months plus an applicable margin determined by reference to fe's reference ratings. changes in fe's reference ratings would lower or raise its applicable margin depending on whether ratings improved or were lowered, respectively.
on february 16, 2017, fe entered into two separate $125 million three-year term loan credit agreements with bank of america, n.a. and the bank of nova scotia, respectively, the proceeds of which were used to reduce short-term debt. the terms and conditions of these new credit agreements are substantially similar to the december 6, 2016, $1.2 billion five-year syndicated term loan credit agreement.
as of december 31, 2016, fe was in compliance with the applicable consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio covenants as well as the interest coverage ratio requirement, as defined under its term loan.
firstenergy money pools firstenergy's utility operating subsidiary companies also have the ability to borrow from each other and the holding company to meet their short-term working capital requirements. a similar but separate arrangement exists among firstenergy's unregulated companies. fesc administers these two money pools and tracks surplus funds of firstenergy and the respective regulated and unregulated subsidiaries, as well as proceeds available from bank borrowings. companies receiving a loan under the money pool agreements must repay the principal amount of the loan, together with accrued interest, within 364 days of borrowing the funds. the rate of interest is the same for each company receiving a loan from their respective pool and is based on the average cost of funds available through the pool. the average interest rate for borrowings in 2016 was 0.69% per annum for the regulated companies' money pool and 2.02% per annum for the unregulated companies' money pool.
as discussed above, fes expects to use its new $500 million secured credit facility with fe in lieu of borrowing under the unregulated companies' money pool. in addition, a separate money pool for use by fes, its subsidiaries and fenoc is expected to be established in the first quarter of 2017 at which time those companies will no longer have access to the unregulated companies' money pool. as of january 31, 2017, fes, its subsidiaries and fenoc had no borrowings in the aggregate under the unregulated companies' money pool.
pollution control revenue bonds in 2016, as discussed below, fg remarketed $86 million of fixed rate pcrbs and retired $12 million of variable interest rate pcrbs, which resulted in the elimination of locs related to $92 million of variable interest rate pcrbs that are no longer outstanding.

in january 2017, fitch initiated coverage of fe's subsidiaries and established ratings as indicated in the above table.
on february 3, 2017, moody's upgraded the senior secured rating of wp, to a1 from a2 and the senior unsecured ratings of me to a3 from baa1 and pn to baa1 from baa2.
debt capacity is subject to the consolidated debt to total capitalization limits in the credit facilities previously discussed. as of december 31, 2016, fe and its subsidiaries could issue additional debt of approximately $4.6 billion, or incur a $2.5 billion reduction to equity, and remain within the limitations of the financial covenants required by the credit facilities.
changes in cash position as of december 31, 2016, firstenergy had $199 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to $131 million of cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2015. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, firstenergy had approximately $61 million and $82 million, respectively, of restricted cash included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
cash flows from operating activities firstenergy's most significant sources of cash are derived from electric service provided by its utility operating subsidiaries and the sales of energy and related products and services by its unregulated competitive subsidiaries. the most significant use of cash from operating activities is to buy electricity in the wholesale market and pay fuel suppliers, employees, tax authorities, lenders, and others for a wide range of material and services.
net cash provided from operating activities was $3,371 million during 2016, $3,447 million during 2015 and $2,713 million during 2014.
2016 compared with 2015
cash flows from operations decreased $76 million in 2016 compared with 2015. the year over year change in cash from operations decreased due to the following:
•   a $239 million increase in cash contributions to the qualified pension plan, partially offset by;
•   higher distribution deliveries and the full year impact of net rate increases implemented in 2015 at certain utilities;
•   higher transmission revenue, reflecting recovery of incremental operating expenses and a higher rate base;
86
•   lower disbursements for fuel and purchased power resulting from the lower sales volumes partially offset by lower capacity revenues at ces.
2015 compared with 2014
cash flows from operations increased $734 million in 2015 compared with 2014 due to the following:
•   distribution rate increases associated with the implementation of new rates, partially offset by a year-over-year decline in distribution deliveries;
•   higher transmission revenue and earnings, reflecting recovery of incremental operating expenses, a higher rate base and forward-looking rates at atsi;
•   higher capacity revenues at ces, partially offset by a decline in sales volume;
•   lower disbursements for fuel and purchased power resulting from lower sales volumes; and
•   lower posted collateral; partially offset by,
•   a $143 million contribution to the qualified pension plan in 2015.
cash flows from financing activities in 2016, cash used for financing activities was $22 million compared to $279 million in 2015 and $513 million of net cash provided from financing activities in 2014. the following table summarizes new debt financing (net of any discounts), redemptions and common stock dividend payments:

2016 compared with 2015
cash used for investing activity in 2016 increased $159 million, compared to the same period of 2015, primarily due to increases in nuclear fuel purchases and property additions. property additions increased primarily due to higher transmission investment and ces' purchase of the remaining non-affiliated leasehold interest in perry unit 1. the increase in nuclear fuel was due to the scheduled davis-besse refueling and maintenance outage in 2016.
2015 compared with 2014
cash used for investing activity in 2015 as compared to 2014 were impacted by lower property additions of $608 million, partially offset by a $374 million reduction in proceeds received from asset sales, as 2014 included proceeds from the sale of certain hydroelectric assets. the decline in property additions were due to the following:
•   a decrease of $351 million at ces, resulting from the absence of capital investments associated with the davis-besse steam generators that were placed into service in may 2014,
•   a decrease of $426 million at regulated transmission primarily relating to the timing of capital investments associated with its energizing the future investment program, partially offset by
•   an increase of $185 million at regulated distribution relating to utility specific project investments and costs associated with the pennsylvania smart meter program.

excluded from the table above are estimates for the cash outlays from power purchase contracts entered into by most of the utilities and under which they procure the power supply necessary to provide generation service to their customers who do not choose an alternative supplier. although actual amounts will be determined by future customer behavior and consumption levels, management currently estimates these cash outlays will be approximately $2.9 billion in 2017, of which $0.4 billion are expected to relate to the utilities' contracts with fes.
the table above also excludes regulatory liabilities (see note 15, regulatory matters), aros (see note 14, asset retirement obligations), reserves for litigation, injuries and damages, environmental remediation, and annual insurance premiums, including nuclear insurance (see note 16, commitments, guarantees and contingencies) since the amount and timing of the cash payments are uncertain. the table also excludes accumulated deferred income taxes and investment tax credits since cash payments for income taxes are determined based primarily on taxable income for each applicable fiscal year.
nuclear insurance the price-anderson act limits the public liability which can be assessed with respect to a nuclear power plant to $13.3 billion (assuming 102 units licensed to operate) for a single nuclear incident, which amount is covered by: (i) private insurance amounting to $375 million; and (ii) $13 billion provided by an industry retrospective rating plan required by the nrc pursuant thereto. under such retrospective rating plan, in the event of a nuclear incident at any unit in the united states resulting in losses in excess of private insurance, up to $127 million (but not more than $19 million per unit per year in the event of more than one incident) must be contributed for each nuclear unit licensed to operate in the country by the licensees thereof to cover liabilities arising out of the incident. based on their present nuclear ownership and leasehold interests, firstenergy's maximum potential assessment under these provisions would be $509 million (ng-$506 million) per incident but not more than $76 million (ng-$75 million) in any one year for each incident.
in addition to the public liability insurance provided pursuant to the price-anderson act, ng purchases insurance coverage in limited amounts for economic loss and property damage arising out of nuclear incidents. ng is a member insured of neil, which provides coverage for the extra expense of replacement power incurred due to prolonged accidental outages of nuclear units. ng, as the member insured and each entity with an insurable interest, purchases policies, renewable annually, corresponding to their respective nuclear interests, which provide an aggregate indemnity of up to approximately $1.40 billion (ng-$1.39 billion) for replacement power costs incurred during an outage after an initial 12-week waiting period.
ng, as the member insured and each entity with an insurable interest, is insured under property damage insurance provided by neil. under these arrangements, up to $2.75 billion of coverage for decontamination costs, decommissioning costs, debris removal and repair and/or replacement of property is provided. member insureds of neil pay annual premiums and are subject to retrospective premium assessments if losses exceed the accumulated funds available to the insurer. ng purchases insurance through neil that will pay its obligation in the event a retrospective premium call is made by neil, subject to the terms of the policy.
firstenergy intends to maintain insurance against nuclear risks as described above as long as it is available. to the extent that replacement power, property damage, decontamination, decommissioning, repair and replacement costs and other such costs
89
arising from a nuclear incident at any of ng's plants exceed the policy limits of the insurance in effect with respect to that plant, to the extent a nuclear incident is determined not to be covered by firstenergy's insurance policies, or to the extent such insurance becomes unavailable in the future, firstenergy would remain at risk for such costs.
the nrc requires nuclear power plant licensees to obtain minimum property insurance coverage of $1.06 billion or the amount generally available from private sources, whichever is less. the proceeds of this insurance are required to be used first to ensure that the licensed reactor is in a safe and stable condition and can be maintained in that condition so as to prevent any significant risk to the public health and safety. within 30 days of stabilization, the licensee is required to prepare and submit to the nrc a cleanup plan for approval. the plan is required to identify all cleanup operations necessary to decontaminate the reactor sufficiently to permit the resumption of operations or to commence decommissioning. any property insurance proceeds not already expended to place the reactor in a safe and stable condition must be used first to complete those decontamination operations that are ordered by the nrc. firstenergy is unable to predict what effect these requirements may have on the availability of insurance proceeds.
guarantees and other assurances firstenergy has various financial and performance guarantees and indemnifications which are issued in the normal course of business. these contracts include performance guarantees, stand-by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. firstenergy enters into these arrangements to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties by enhancing the value of the transaction to the third party. the maximum potential amount of future payments firstenergy could be required to make under these guarantees as of december 31, 2016, was approximately $3.3 billion, as summarized below:

fes' debt obligations are generally guaranteed by its subsidiaries, fg and ng, and fes guarantees the debt obligations of each of fg and ng. accordingly, present and future holders of indebtedness of fes, fg, and ng would have claims against each of fes, fg, and ng, regardless of whether their primary obligor is fes, fg, or ng.
collateral and contingent-related features in the normal course of business, fe and its subsidiaries routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts for the sale and purchase of electric capacity, energy, fuel and emission allowances. certain bilateral agreements and derivative instruments contain provisions that require fe or its subsidiaries to post collateral. this collateral may be posted in the form of cash or credit support with thresholds contingent upon fe's or its subsidiaries' credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies. the collateral and credit support requirements vary by contract and by counterparty. the incremental collateral requirement allows for the offsetting of assets and liabilities with the same counterparty, where the contractual right of offset exists under applicable master netting agreements.
bilateral agreements and derivative instruments entered into by fe and its subsidiaries have margining provisions that require posting of collateral. based on fes' power portfolio exposure as of december 31, 2016, fes has posted collateral of $190 million and ae supply has posted collateral of $4 million. the regulated distribution segment has posted collateral of $3 million.
these credit-risk-related contingent features, or the margining provisions within bilateral agreements, stipulate that if the subsidiary were to be downgraded or lose its investment grade credit rating (based on its senior unsecured debt rating), it would be required to provide additional collateral. depending on the volume of forward contracts and future price movements, higher amounts for margining, which is the ability to secure additional collateral when needed, could be required. the following table discloses the potential additional credit rating contingent contractual collateral obligations as of december 31, 2016:

(1) effective january 2017, fe is a guarantor for $169 million of fg surety bonds for the benefit of the pa dep with respect to lbr.
excluded from the preceding chart are the potential collateral obligations due to affiliate transactions between the regulated distribution segment and ces segment. as of december 31, 2016, neither fes nor ae supply had any collateral posted with their affiliates. moreover, a further downgrade for either fes or ae supply would not trigger any obligations to post any such collateral.
other commitments, contingencies and assurances fe is a guarantor under a syndicated senior secured term loan facility due march 3, 2020, under which global holding borrowed $300 million. in addition to firstenergy, signal peak, global rail, global mining group, llc and global coal sales group, llc, each being a direct or indirect subsidiary of global holding, continue to provide their joint and several guaranties of the obligations of global holding under the facility.
in connection with the facility, 69.99% of global holding's direct and indirect membership interests in signal peak, global rail and their affiliates along with fev's and wmb marketing ventures, llc's respective  33-1/3% membership interests in global holding, are pledged to the lenders under the current facility as collateral.
off-balance sheet arrangements fes and certain of the ohio companies have obligations that are not included on their consolidated balance sheets related to the perry unit 1, beaver valley unit 2, and 2007 bruce mansfield unit 1 sale and leaseback arrangements, which are satisfied through operating lease payments. the total present value of these sale and leaseback operating lease commitments, net of trust investments, was $879 million as of december 31, 2016 and primarily relates to the 2007 bruce mansfield unit 1 sale and leaseback arrangement expiring in 2040.
on june 24, 2014, oe exercised its irrevocable right to repurchase from the remaining owner participants the lessors' interests in beaver valley unit 2 at the end of the lease term (june 1, 2017), which right to repurchase was assigned to ng. upon the completion of this transaction, ng will have obtained all of the lessor equity interests at beaver valley unit 2. therefore, upon the expiration of the beaver valley unit 2 leases, ng will be the sole owner of beaver valley unit 2 and entitled to 100% of the unit's output. as of december 31, 2016, oe's leasehold interest was 2.60% of beaver valley unit 2 and fes' leasehold interest was 93.83% of bruce mansfield unit 1.
on may 23, 2016, ng completed the purchase of the 3.75% lessor equity interests of the remaining non-affiliated leasehold interest in perry unit 1 for $50 million. in addition, the perry unit 1 leases expired in accordance with their terms on may 30, 2016, resulting in ng being the sole owner of perry unit 1 and entitled to 100% of the unit's output.
market risk information firstenergy uses various market risk sensitive instruments, including derivative contracts, primarily to manage the risk of price and interest rate fluctuations. firstenergy's risk policy committee, comprised of members of senior management, provides general oversight for risk management activities throughout the company.
commodity price risk firstenergy is exposed to financial risks resulting from fluctuating commodity prices, including prices for electricity, natural gas, coal and energy transmission. firstenergy's risk management committee is responsible for promoting the effective design and implementation of sound risk management programs and oversees compliance with corporate risk management policies and established risk management practice. firstenergy uses a variety of derivative instruments for risk management purposes including forward contracts, options, futures contracts and swaps.
the valuation of derivative contracts is based on observable market information to the extent that such information is available. in cases where such information is not available, firstenergy relies on model-based information. the model provides estimates of future regional prices for electricity and an estimate of related price volatility. firstenergy uses these results to develop estimates

(2)   primarily represents contracts based on broker and ice quotes.
(3)   includes $(107) million in non-hedge derivative contracts that are primarily related to nug contracts at certain of the utilities. nug contracts are subject to regulatory accounting and do not impact earnings.
firstenergy performs sensitivity analyses to estimate its exposure to the market risk of its commodity positions. based on derivative contracts as of december 31, 2016, not subject to regulatory accounting, an increase in commodity prices of 10% would decrease net income by approximately $29 million during the next twelve months.
equity price risk as of december 31, 2016, the firstenergy pension plan assets were allocated approximately as follows: 46% in equity securities, 31% in fixed income securities, 8% in absolute return strategies, 10% in real estate, 1% in private equity, and 4% in cash and short-term securities. a decline in the value of plan assets could result in additional funding requirements. firstenergy's funding policy is based on actuarial computations using the projected unit credit method. in 2016, firstenergy satisfied its minimum required funding obligations of $382 million and addressed funding obligations for future years to its qualified pension plan with total contributions of $882 million (of which $138 million was cash contributions from fes), including $500 million of fe common stock contributed to the qualified pension plan on december 13, 2016. in 2017, firstenergy does not have a minimum required funding obligation to its qualified pension plan due to the equity contribution. see "note 4, pension and other postemployment benefits", of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details on firstenergy's pension plans and opeb. in 2016, firstenergy's pension plan assets earned approximately 8.6%, as compared to an expected return on plan assets of 7.5%.
as of december 31, 2016, firstenergy's opeb plans were invested in fixed income and equity securities. in 2016 firstenergy's opeb plans have earned approximately 7.0% as compared to an annual expected return on plan assets of 7.5%.
ndt funds have been established to satisfy ng's and other firstenergy subsidiaries' nuclear decommissioning obligations. as of december 31, 2016, approximately 61% of the funds were invested in fixed income securities, 37% of the funds were invested in equity securities and 2% were invested in short-term investments, with limitations related to concentration and investment grade ratings. the investments are carried at their market values of approximately $1,531 million, $925 million and $60 million for fixed income securities, equity securities and short-term investments, respectively, as of december 31, 2016, excluding $(2) million of net receivables, payables and accrued income. a hypothetical 10% decrease in prices quoted by stock exchanges would result in a $93 million reduction in fair value as of december 31, 2016. certain firstenergy subsidiaries recognize in earnings the unrealized losses on afs securities held in its ndt as otti. a decline in the value of firstenergy's ndt funds or a significant escalation in estimated decommissioning costs could result in additional funding requirements. during 2016, firstenergy contributed approximately $2 million to the ndt.
interest rate risk firstenergy's exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates is reduced since a significant portion of debt has fixed interest rates, as noted in the table below. firstenergy is subject to the inherent interest rate risks related to refinancing maturing debt by issuing new debt securities. as discussed in "note 7, leases" of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements, firstenergy's investments in capital trusts effectively reduce future lease obligations, also reducing interest rate risk.

credit risk credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty to a transaction will be unable to fulfill its contractual obligations. firstenergy evaluates the credit standing of a prospective counterparty based on the prospective counterparty's financial condition. firstenergy may impose specific collateral requirements and use standardized agreements that facilitate the netting of cash flows. firstenergy monitors the financial conditions of existing counterparties on an ongoing basis. an independent risk management group oversees credit risk.
wholesale credit risk firstenergy measures wholesale credit risk as the replacement cost for derivatives in power, natural gas, coal and emission allowances, adjusted for amounts owed to, or due from, counterparties for settled transactions. the replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains, net of any unrealized losses, where firstenergy has a legally enforceable right of offset. firstenergy monitors and manages the credit risk of wholesale marketing, risk management and energy transacting operations through credit policies and procedures, which include an established credit approval process, daily monitoring of counterparty credit limits, the use of credit mitigation measures such as margin, collateral and the use of master netting agreements. the majority of firstenergy's energy contract counterparties maintain investment-grade credit ratings.
retail credit risk firstenergy's principal retail credit risk exposure relates to its competitive electricity activities, which serve residential, commercial and industrial companies. retail credit risk results when customers default on contractual obligations or fail to pay for service rendered. this risk represents the loss that may be incurred due to the nonpayment of customer accounts receivable balances, as well as the loss from the resale of energy previously committed to serve customers.
retail credit risk is managed through established credit approval policies, monitoring customer exposures and the use of credit mitigation measures such as deposits in the form of locs, cash or prepayment arrangements.
retail credit quality is affected by the economy and the ability of customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes. if the business environment were to be negatively affected by changes in economic or other market conditions, firstenergy's retail credit risk may be adversely impacted.
outlook state regulation each of the utilities' retail rates, conditions of service, issuance of securities and other matters are subject to regulation in the states in which it operates - in maryland by the mdpsc, in ohio by the puco, in new jersey by the njbpu, in pennsylvania by the ppuc, in west virginia by the wvpsc and in new york by the nypsc. the transmission operations of pe in virginia are subject to certain regulations of the vscc. in addition, under ohio law, municipalities may regulate rates of a public utility, subject to appeal to the puco if not acceptable to the utility.
as competitive retail electric suppliers serving retail customers primarily in ohio, pennsylvania, illinois, michigan, new jersey and maryland, fes and ae supply are subject to state laws applicable to competitive electric suppliers in those states, including affiliate codes of conduct that apply to fes, ae supply and their public utility affiliates. in addition, if any of the firstenergy affiliates were
93
to engage in the construction of significant new transmission or generation facilities, depending on the state, they may be required to obtain state regulatory authorization to site, construct and operate the new transmission or generation facility.
maryland pe provides sos pursuant to a combination of settlement agreements, mdpsc orders and regulations, and statutory provisions. sos supply is competitively procured in the form of rolling contracts of varying lengths through periodic auctions that are overseen by the mdpsc and a third party monitor. although settlements with respect to sos supply for pe customers have expired, service continues in the same manner until changed by order of the mdpsc. pe recovers its costs plus a return for providing sos.
the maryland legislature adopted a statute in 2008 codifying the empower maryland goals to reduce electric consumption and demand and requiring each electric utility to file a plan every three years. pe's current plan, covering the three-year period 2015-2017, was approved by the mdpsc on december 23, 2014. on july 16, 2015, the mdpsc issued an order setting new incremental energy savings goals for 2017 and beyond, beginning with the goal of 0.97% savings set in pe's plan for 2016, and increasing 0.2% per year thereafter to reach 2%. the costs of the 2015-2017 plan are expected to be approximately $70 million, of which $43 million was incurred through december 31, 2016. pe continues to recover program costs subject to a five-year amortization. maryland law only allows for the utility to recover lost distribution revenue attributable to energy efficiency or demand reduction programs through a base rate case proceeding, and to date, such recovery has not been sought or obtained by pe.
on february 27, 2013, the mdpsc issued an order requiring the maryland electric utilities to submit analyses relating to the costs and benefits of making further system and staffing enhancements in order to attempt to reduce storm outage durations. pe's responsive filings discussed the steps needed to harden the utility's system in order to attempt to achieve various levels of storm response speed described in the february 2013 order, and projected that it would require approximately $2.7 billion in infrastructure investments over 15 years to attempt to achieve the quickest level of response for the largest storm projected in the february 2013 order. on july 1, 2014, the staff of the mdpsc issued a set of reports that recommended the imposition of extensive additional requirements in the areas of storm response, feeder performance, estimates of restoration times, and regulatory reporting, as well as the imposition of penalties, including customer rebates, for a utility's failure or inability to comply with the escalating standards of storm restoration speed proposed by the staff of the mdpsc. in addition, the staff of the mdpsc proposed that the maryland utilities be required to develop and implement system hardening plans, up to a rate impact cap on cost. the mdpsc conducted a hearing september 15-18, 2014, to consider certain of these matters, and has not yet issued a ruling on any of those matters.
on september 26, 2016, the mdpsc initiated a new proceeding to consider an array of issues relating to electric distribution system design, including matters relating to electric vehicles, distributed energy resources, advanced metering infrastructure, energy storage, system planning, rate design, and impacts on low-income customers. initial comments in the proceeding were filed on october 28, 2016, and the mdpsc held an initial hearing on the matter on december 8-9, 2016. on january 31, 2017, the mdpsc issued a notice establishing five working groups to address these issues over the following eighteen months, and also directed the retention of an outside consultant to prepare a report on costs and benefits of distributed solar generation in maryland.
new jersey jcp&l currently provides bgs for retail customers who do not choose a third party egs and for customers of third party egss that fail to provide the contracted service. the supply for bgs is comprised of two components, procured through separate, annually held descending clock auctions, the results of which are approved by the njbpu. one bgs component reflects hourly real time energy prices and is available for larger commercial and industrial customers. the second bgs component provides a fixed price service and is intended for smaller commercial and residential customers. all new jersey edcs participate in this competitive bgs procurement process and recover bgs costs directly from customers as a charge separate from base rates.
pursuant to the njbpu's march 26, 2015 final order in jcp&l's 2012 rate case proceeding directing that certain studies be completed, on july 22, 2015, the njbpu approved the njbpu staff's recommendation to implement such studies, which include operational and financial components. the independent consultant conducting the review issued a final report on july 27, 2016, recognizing that jcp&l is meeting the njbpu requirements and making various operational and financial recommendations. the njbpu issued an order on august 24, 2016, that accepted the independent consultant's final report and directed jcp&l, the division of rate counsel and other interested parties to address the recommendations.
in an order issued october 22, 2014, in a generic proceeding to review its policies with respect to the use of a cta in base rate cases (generic cta proceeding), the njbpu stated that it would continue to apply its current cta policy in base rate cases, subject to incorporating the following modifications: (i) calculating savings using a five-year look back from the beginning of the test year; (ii) allocating savings with 75% retained by the company and 25% allocated to rate payers; and (iii) excluding transmission assets of electric distribution companies in the savings calculation. on november 5, 2014, the division of rate counsel appealed the njbpu order regarding the generic cta proceeding to the new jersey superior court and jcp&l filed to participate as a respondent in that proceeding. briefing has been completed. the oral argument was held on october 25, 2016.
on april 28, 2016, jcp&l filed tariffs with the njbpu proposing a general rate increase associated with its distribution operations to improve service and benefit customers by supporting equipment maintenance, tree trimming, and inspections of lines, poles and substations, while also compensating for other business and operating expenses. the filing requested approval to increase annual
94
operating revenues by approximately $142.1 million based upon a hybrid test year for the twelve months ending june 30, 2016. on november 30, 2016, jcp&l submitted to the alj a stipulation of settlement achieved with all the intervening parties providing for an annual $80 million distribution revenue increase, effective january 1, 2017. the alj filed an initial decision concluding that the stipulation of settlement should be approved, and the njbpu approved the stipulation of settlement on december 12, 2016. as part of the stipulation of settlement the intervening parties agreed that jcp&l can accelerate the amortization of the 2012 major storm expenses (approximately $19 million annually) that are recovered through the src to achieve full recovery by december 31, 2019. on november 23, 2016, jcp&l filed an amendment to its january 15, 2016 src filing with the njbpu, requesting that jcp&l be able to accelerate the amortization of the 2012 major storm expenses as agreed to in the stipulation of settlement, and a stipulation of settlement with njbpu staff and the division of rate counsel regarding the src filing was filed on december 27, 2016. the njbpu approved this stipulation of settlement at the january 25, 2017 public meeting.
ohio the ohio companies currently operate under an esp iv which commenced june 1, 2016 and expires may 31, 2024. the material terms of esp iv, as approved in the puco's opinions and orders issued on march 31, 2016 and october 12, 2016, include rider dmr, which provides for the ohio companies to collect $132.5 million annually for three years, with the possibility of a two-year extension. the rider dmr will be grossed up for taxes, resulting in an approved amount of approximately $204 million annually. revenues from the rider dmr will be excluded from the significantly excessive earnings test for the initial three-year term but the exclusion will be reconsidered upon application for a potential two-year extension. the puco set three conditions for continued recovery under rider dmr: (1) retention of the corporate headquarters and nexus of operations in akron, ohio; (2) no change in control of the ohio companies; and (3) a demonstration of sufficient progress in the implementation of grid modernization programs approved by the puco. esp iv also continues a base distribution rate freeze through may 31, 2024. in addition, esp iv continues the supply of power to non-shopping customers at a market-based price set through an auction process.
esp iv also continues rider dcr, which supports continued investment related to the distribution system for the benefit of customers, with increased revenue caps of approximately $30 million per year from june 1, 2016 through may 31, 2019; $20 million per year from june 1, 2019 through may 31, 2022; and $15 million per year from june 1, 2022 through may 31, 2024. other material terms of esp iv include the collection of lost distribution revenues associated with energy efficiency and peak demand reduction programs, an agreement to file a grid modernization business plan for puco consideration and approval (which filing was made on february 29, 2016), a goal across firstenergy to reduce co2 emissions by 90% below 2005 levels by 2045, and contributions, totaling $51 million, to fund energy conservation programs, economic development and job retention in the ohio companies' service territory, and a fuel-fund in each of the ohio companies' service territories to assist low-income customers, and to establish a customer advisory council to ensure preservation and growth of the competitive market in ohio.
on april 29, 2016 and may 2, 2016, several parties, including the ohio companies, filed applications for rehearing on the ohio companies' esp iv with the puco. on september 6, 2016, while the applications for rehearing were still pending before the puco, the occ and noac filed a notice of appeal with the ohio supreme court appealing various puco and attorney examiner entries on the parties' applications for rehearing. on september 16, 2016, the ohio companies intervened and filed a motion to dismiss the appeal. the puco resolved such applications for rehearing in the october 12, 2016 opinion and order. the occ and noac appeal remains pending before the ohio supreme court.
on november 10, 2016 and november 14, 2016, several parties, including the ohio companies, filed additional applications for rehearing on the ohio companies' esp iv with the puco. the ohio companies' application for rehearing challenged, among other things, the puco's failure to adopt the ohio companies' suggested modifications to rider dmr. the ohio companies had previously suggested that a properly designed rider dmr would be valued at $558 million annually for eight years, and include an additional amount that recognizes the value of the economic impact of firstenergy maintaining its headquarters in ohio. other parties' applications for rehearing argued, among other things, that the puco's adoption of rider dmr is not supported by law or sufficient evidence. on december 7, 2016, the puco granted the applications for rehearing for further consideration of the matters specified in the applications for rehearing.  the matter remains pending before the puco. for additional information, see "ferc matters - ohio esp iv ppa," below.
under orc 4928.66, the ohio companies were required to implement energy efficiency programs that achieved a total annual energy savings of 1,990 gwhs and total peak demand reduction of 486 mws in 2015. on may 12, 2016, the ohio companies filed their energy efficiency and peak demand reduction program status report indicating compliance with their 2015 statutory benchmarks. in 2016, the ohio companies estimated the annual energy savings target and peak demand reduction target will be comparable to the 2015 targets due to the energy efficiency requirements under sb310, which amended orc 4928.66 to freeze the energy efficiency and peak demand reduction benchmarks for 2015 and 2016. starting in 2017, orc 4928.66 requires the energy savings benchmark to increase by 1% and the peak demand reduction benchmark to increase by 0.75% annually thereafter through 2020.
on april 15, 2016, the ohio companies filed an application for approval of their three-year energy efficiency portfolio plans for the period from january 1, 2017 through december 31, 2019. the plans as proposed comply with benchmarks contemplated by orc 4928.66 and provisions of the esp iv, and include a portfolio of energy efficiency programs targeted to a variety of customer segments, including residential customers, low income customers, small commercial customers, large commercial and industrial customers and governmental entities. on december 9, 2016, the ohio companies filed a stipulation and recommendation with
95
several parties that contained changes to the plan and a decrease in the plan costs. the ohio companies anticipate the cost of the plans will be approximately $268 million over the life of the portfolio plans and such costs are expected to be recovered through the ohio companies' existing rate mechanisms. the hearings were held in january 2017.
ohio law requires electric utilities and electric service companies in ohio to serve part of their load from renewable energy resources measured by an annually increasing percentage amount through 2026, except 2015 and 2016 that remain at the 2014 level. the ohio companies conducted rfps in 2009, 2010 and 2011 to secure recs to help meet these renewable energy requirements. in september 2011, the puco opened a docket to review the ohio companies' alternative energy recovery rider through which the ohio companies recover the costs of acquiring these recs. the puco issued an opinion and order on august 7, 2013, approving the ohio companies' acquisition process and their purchases of recs to meet statutory mandates in all instances except for certain purchases arising from one auction and directed the ohio companies to credit non-shopping customers in the amount of $43.4 million, plus interest, on the basis that the ohio companies did not prove such purchases were prudent. on december 24, 2013, following the denial of their application for rehearing, the ohio companies filed a notice of appeal and a motion for stay of the puco's order with the supreme court of ohio, which was granted. on february 18, 2014, the occ and the elpc also filed appeals of the puco's order. the ohio companies timely filed their merit brief with the supreme court of ohio and the briefing process has concluded. the matter is not yet scheduled for oral argument.
on april 9, 2014, the puco initiated a generic investigation of marketing practices in the competitive retail electric service market, with a focus on the marketing of fixed-price or guaranteed percent-off sso rate contracts where there is a provision that permits the pass-through of new or additional charges. on november 18, 2015, the puco ruled that on a going-forward basis, pass-through clauses may not be included in fixed-price contracts for all customer classes. on december 18, 2015, fes filed an application for rehearing seeking to change the ruling or have it only apply to residential and small commercial customers. on january 13, 2016, the puco granted reconsideration for further consideration of the matters specified in the applications for rehearing. the matter remains pending before the puco.
pennsylvania the pennsylvania companies currently operate under dsps that expire on may 31, 2017, and provide for the competitive procurement of generation supply for customers that do not choose an alternative egs or for customers of alternative egss that fail to provide the contracted service. the default service supply is currently provided by wholesale suppliers through a mix of long-term and short-term contracts procured through spot market purchases, quarterly descending clock auctions for 3-, 12- and 24-month energy contracts, and one rfp seeking 2-year contracts to serve srecs for me, pn and penn.
following the expiration of the current dsps, the pennsylvania companies will operate under new dsps for the june 1, 2017 through may 31, 2019 delivery period, which provide for the competitive procurement of generation supply for customers who do not choose an alternative egs or for customers of alternative egss that fail to provide the contracted service. under the new dsps, the supply will be provided by wholesale suppliers through a mix of 12- and 24-month energy contracts, as well as one rfp for 2-year srec contracts for me, pn and penn. in addition, the new dsps include modifications to the pennsylvania companies' existing por programs in order to reduce the level of uncollectible expense the pennsylvania companies experience associated with alternative egs charges.
pursuant to pennsylvania's ee&c legislation (act 129 of 2008) and ppuc orders, pennsylvania edcs implement energy efficiency and peak demand reduction programs. the pennsylvania companies' phase ii ee&c plans were effective through may 31, 2016. total phase ii costs of these plans were $174 million and are recoverable through the pennsylvania companies' reconcilable ee&c riders. on june 19, 2015, the ppuc issued a phase iii final implementation order setting: demand reduction targets, relative to each pennsylvania companies' 2007-2008 peak demand (in mw), at 1.8% for me, 1.7% for penn, 1.8% for wp, and 0% for pn; and energy consumption reduction targets, as a percentage of each pennsylvania companies' historic 2010 forecasts (in mwh), at 4.0% for me, 3.9% for pn, 3.3% for penn, and 2.6% for wp. the pennsylvania companies' phase iii ee&c plans for the june 2016 through may 2021 period, which were approved in march 2016, with expected costs up to $390 million, are designed to achieve the targets established in the ppuc's phase iii final implementation order with full recovery through the reconcilable ee&c riders.
pursuant to act 11 of 2012, pennsylvania edcs may establish a dsic to recover costs of infrastructure improvements and costs related to highway relocation projects with ppuc approval. pennsylvania edcs must file ltiips outlining infrastructure improvement plans for ppuc review and approval prior to approval of a dsic. on october 19, 2015, each of the pennsylvania companies filed ltiips with the ppuc for infrastructure improvement over the five-year period of 2016 to 2020 for the following costs: wp- $88.34 million; pn- $56.74 million; penn- $56.35 million; and me- $43.44 million. on february 11, 2016, the ppuc approved the pennsylvania companies' ltiips. on february 16, 2016, the pennsylvania companies filed dsic riders for ppuc approval for quarterly cost recovery associated with the capital projects approved in the ltiips. on june 9, 2016, the ppuc approved the pennsylvania companies' dsic riders to be effective july 1, 2016, subject to hearings and refund or reallocation among customers. the four proceedings were consolidated by the alj. on january 19, 2017, in the ppuc's order approving the pennsylvania companies' general rate cases, discussed below, the ppuc referred the issue of whether adit should be included in dsic calculations to the consolidated dsic proceeding. on february 2, 2017, the parties to the consolidated dsic proceeding submitted a joint settlement to the alj to resolve issues referred to by the alj in its june 9, 2016 order, subject to ppuc approval, and would not result in any refund or reallocation among customers. the adit issue will be considered separately from the issues
96
resolved in the joint settlement petition of february 2, 2017, and is the sole issue to be litigated in the consolidated dsic proceeding through a procedural schedule to be determined by the alj.
on april 28, 2016, each of the pennsylvania companies filed tariffs with the ppuc proposing general rate increases associated with their distribution operations to benefit customers by modernizing the grid with smart technologies, increasing vegetation management activities, and continuing other customer service enhancements. the filings requested approval to increase annual operating revenues by approximately $140.2 million at me, $158.8 million at pn, $42.0 million at penn, and $98.2 million at wp, based upon fully projected future test years for the twelve months ending december 31, 2017 at each of the pennsylvania companies. as a result of the enactment of act 40 of 2016 that terminated the practice of making a cta when calculating a utility's federal income taxes for ratemaking purposes, the pennsylvania companies submitted supplemental testimony on july 7, 2016, that quantified the value of the elimination of the cta and outlined their plan for investing 50 percent of that amount in rate base eligible equipment as required by the new law. formal settlement agreements for each of the pennsylvania companies were filed on october 14, 2016, which proposed increases in annual operating revenues of approximately $96 million at me, $100 million at pn, $29 million at penn, and $66 million at wp. one item related to the calculation of dsic rates was reserved for briefing, with briefs filed by two parties. on november 21, 2016, the alj issued a recommended decision recommending approval of the settlement agreements and dismissal of the one issue reserved for briefing. exceptions to that recommended decision were filed by one party on december 1, 2016, and reply exceptions were filed by the pennsylvania companies on december 8, 2016. on january 19, 2017, the ppuc issued an order approving the settlements and referring the reserved issue to the pennsylvania companies' consolidated dsic proceeding. on february 3, 2017, one party filed a petition for reconsideration or clarification relating to the limited issue of the scope of the record to be transferred to the dsic proceeding, discussed above. the outcome of this request will not affect the new rates which took effect on january 27, 2017.
west virginia mp and pe provide electric service to all customers through traditional cost-based, regulated utility ratemaking. mp and pe recover net power supply costs, including fuel costs, purchased power costs and related expenses, net of related market sales revenue through the enec. mp's and pe's enec rate is updated annually.
on march 31, 2016, mp and pe filed with the wvpsc seeking approval of their phase ii energy efficiency program including three mp and pe energy efficiency programs to meet their phase ii requirement of energy efficiency reductions of 0.5% of 2013 distribution sales for the january 1, 2017 through may 31, 2018 period, as agreed to by mp and pe, and approved by the wvpsc in the 2012 proceeding approving the transfer of ownership of the harrison power station to mp. the costs for the phase ii program are expected to be $10.4 million and are eligible for recovery through the existing energy efficiency rider which is reviewed in the fuel (enec) case each year. a unanimous settlement was reached by the parties on all issues and presented to the wvpsc on august 18, 2016.  an order approving the settlement in full without modification was issued by the wvpsc on september 23, 2016. the phase ii program began initial implementation in november 2016.
the staff of the wvpsc and the consumer advocate division filed a show cause petition on august 5, 2016, requesting that the wvpsc order mp and pe to file and implement rfps for all future capacity and energy requirements above 100 mws and that they comply with an rfp settlement provision from the harrison power station acquisition. mp and pe filed a timely response to the petition arguing for dismissal on september 7, 2016. on october 17, 2016, the wvpsc denied the petition filed by the staff of the wvpsc and the consumer advocate division and dismissed the case.
on august 16, 2016, mp and pe filed their annual enec case proposing an annual increase in rates of approximately $65 million effective january 1, 2017, which is a 4.7% increase over existing rates. the increase is comprised of a $119 million under-recovered balance as of june 30, 2016, and a projected $54 million over-recovery for the 2017 rate effective period. the parties reached a unanimous settlement providing for a $25 million increase beginning january 1, 2017 and keeping enec rates at the same level for a two year period. the settlement was presented to the wvpsc at a hearing on november 9, 2016. on december 9, 2016, the wvpsc approved the settlement as submitted.
on august 22, 2016, mp and pe filed an application for approval of a modernization and improvement plan for coal-fired boilers at electric power plants and cost-recovery surcharge proposing an approximate $6.9 million annual increase in rates to be effective may 1, 2017, which is a 0.5% increase over existing rates. the filing is in response to recent legislation by the west virginia legislature permitting accelerated recovery of costs related to modernizing and improving coal-fired boilers, including costs related to meeting environmental requirements and reducing emissions. the filing was supplemented on september 28, 2016, to add two additional projects, resulting in an approximate $7.4 million annual increase in rates. the staff of the wvpsc filed a motion to dismiss the case arguing the new statute was not meant to recover these types of projects, but the wvpsc set the case for hearing for february 21-23, 2017. as part of the annual enec settlement described above, the parties agreed that mp and pe will increase enec rates to provide for a return of and on mats/cspr capital costs incurred during 2016-2017. accordingly, mp and pe withdrew this case as part of the enec approval.
on december 30, 2015, mp filed an irp with the wvpsc identifying a capacity shortfall starting in 2016 and exceeding 700 mws by 2020 and 850 mws by 2027. on june 3, 2016, the wvpsc accepted the irp finding that irps are informational and that it must not approve or disapprove the irp. mp issued a rfp to address its generation shortfall identified in the irp on december 16, 2016 along with issuing a second rfp to sell its interest in bath county. bids were received by an independent evaluator in february
97
2017 for both rfps. mp expects to execute definitive agreements with selected respondent(s) and file the appropriate applications with the wvpsc and ferc by march 15, 2017.
reliability matters federally-enforceable mandatory reliability standards apply to the bulk electric system and impose certain operating, record-keeping and reporting requirements on the utilities, fes and its subsidiaries, ae supply, fenoc, atsi and trail. nerc is the ero designated by ferc to establish and enforce these reliability standards, although nerc has delegated day-to-day implementation and enforcement of these reliability standards to eight regional entities, including rfc. all of firstenergy's facilities are located within the rfc region. firstenergy actively participates in the nerc and rfc stakeholder processes, and otherwise monitors and manages its companies in response to the ongoing development, implementation and enforcement of the reliability standards implemented and enforced by rfc.
firstenergy, including fes, believes that it is in compliance with all currently-effective and enforceable reliability standards. nevertheless, in the course of operating its extensive electric utility systems and facilities, firstenergy, including fes, occasionally learns of isolated facts or circumstances that could be interpreted as excursions from the reliability standards. if and when such occurrences are found, firstenergy, including fes, develops information about the occurrence and develops a remedial response to the specific circumstances, including in appropriate cases "self-reporting" an occurrence to rfc. moreover, it is clear that nerc, rfc and ferc will continue to refine existing reliability standards as well as to develop and adopt new reliability standards. any inability on firstenergy's, including fes, part to comply with the reliability standards for its bulk electric system could result in the imposition of financial penalties, and obligations to upgrade or build transmission facilities, that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
ferc matters ohio esp iv ppa on august 4, 2014, the ohio companies filed an application with the puco seeking approval of their esp iv. esp iv included a proposed rider rrs, which would flow through to customers either charges or credits representing the net result of the price paid to fes through an eight-year ferc-jurisdictional ppa, referred to as the esp iv ppa, against the revenues received from selling such output into the pjm markets. the ohio companies entered into stipulations which modified esp iv, and on march 31, 2016, the puco issued an opinion and order adopting and approving the ohio companies' stipulated esp iv with modifications. fes and the ohio companies entered into the esp iv ppa on april 1, 2016.
on january 27, 2016, certain parties filed a complaint with ferc against fes and the ohio companies requesting ferc review the esp iv ppa under section 205 of the fpa. on april 27, 2016, ferc issued an order granting the complaint, prohibiting any transactions under the esp iv ppa pending authorization by ferc, and directing fes to submit the esp iv ppa for ferc review if the parties desired to transact under the agreement. fes and the ohio companies did not file the esp iv ppa for ferc review but rather agreed to suspend the esp iv ppa. fes and the ohio companies subsequently advised ferc of this course of action. on january 19, 2017, ferc issued an order accepting compliance filings by fes, its subsidiaries, and the ohio companies updating their respective market-based rate tariffs to clarify that affiliate sales restrictions under the tariffs apply to the esp iv ppa, and also that the esp iv ppa does not affect certain other waivers of its affiliate restrictions rules ferc previously granted these entities.
on may 2, 2016, the ohio companies filed an application for rehearing with the puco that included a modified rider rrs proposal that did not involve a ferc-jurisdictional ppa. several parties subsequently filed protests and comments with ferc alleging, among other things, that the modified rider rrs constituted a "virtual ppa". ferc rejected these protests in its january 19, 2017 order accepting the updated market-based rate tariffs of fes, its subsidiaries, and the ohio companies discussed below.
on march 21, 2016, a number of generation owners filed with ferc a complaint against pjm requesting that ferc expand the mopr in the pjm tariff to prevent the alleged artificial suppression of prices in the pjm capacity markets by state-subsidized generation, in particular alleged price suppression that could result from the esp iv ppa and other similar agreements. the complaint requested that ferc direct pjm to initiate a stakeholder process to develop a long-term mopr reform for existing resources that receive out-of-market revenue. on january 9, 2017, the generation owners filed to amend their complaint to include challenges to certain legislation and regulatory programs in illinois. on january 24, 2017, fesc, acting on behalf of its affected affiliates and along with other utility companies, filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint for various reasons, including that the esp iv ppa matter is now moot. in addition, on january 30, 2017, fesc along with other utility companies filed a substantive protest to the amended complaint, demonstrating that the question of the proper role for state participation in generation development should be addressed in the pjm stakeholder process. this proceeding remains pending before ferc.
pjm transmission rates pjm and its stakeholders have been debating the proper method to allocate costs for certain transmission facilities. while firstenergy and other parties advocate for a traditional "beneficiary pays" (or usage based) approach, others advocate for "socializing" the costs on a load-ratio share basis, where each customer in the zone would pay based on its total usage of energy within pjm. this question has been the subject of extensive litigation before ferc and the appellate courts, including before the seventh circuit. on june
98
25, 2014, a divided three-judge panel of the seventh circuit ruled that ferc had not quantified the benefits that western pjm utilities would derive from certain new 500 kv or higher lines and thus had not adequately supported its decision to socialize the costs of these lines. the majority found that eastern pjm utilities are the primary beneficiaries of the lines, while western pjm utilities are only incidental beneficiaries, and that, while incidental beneficiaries should pay some share of the costs of the lines, that share should be proportionate to the benefit they derive from the lines, and not on load-ratio share in pjm as a whole. the court remanded the case to ferc, which issued an order setting the issue of cost allocation for hearing and settlement proceedings. on june 15, 2016, various parties, including atsi and the utilities, filed a settlement agreement at ferc agreeing to apply a combined usage based/socialization approach to cost allocation for charges to transmission customers in the pjm region for transmission projects operating at or above 500 kv. certain other parties in the proceeding did not agree to the settlement and filed protests to the settlement seeking, among other issues, to strike certain of the evidence advanced by firstenergy and certain of the other settling parties in support of the settlement, as well as provided further comments in opposition to the settlement. the pjm tos responded to the protesting parties' various pleadings and motions. the settlement is pending before ferc.
rto realignment on june 1, 2011, atsi and the atsi zone transferred from miso to pjm. while many of the matters involved with the move have been resolved, ferc denied recovery under atsi's transmission rate for certain charges that collectively can be described as "exit fees" and certain other transmission cost allocation charges totaling approximately $78.8 million until such time as atsi submits a cost/benefit analysis demonstrating net benefits to customers from the transfer to pjm. subsequently, ferc rejected a proposed settlement agreement to resolve the exit fee and transmission cost allocation issues, stating that its action is without prejudice to atsi submitting a cost/benefit analysis demonstrating that the benefits of the rto realignment decisions outweigh the exit fee and transmission cost allocation charges. on march 17, 2016, ferc denied firstenergy's request for rehearing of ferc's earlier order rejecting the settlement agreement and affirmed its prior ruling that atsi must submit the cost/benefit analysis.
separately, the question of atsi's responsibility for certain costs for the "michigan thumb" transmission project continues to be disputed. potential responsibility arises under the miso mvp tariff, which has been litigated in complex proceedings before ferc and certain united states appellate courts. on october 29, 2015, ferc issued an order finding that atsi and the atsi zone do not have to pay miso mvp charges for the michigan thumb transmission project. miso and the miso tos filed a request for rehearing, which ferc denied on may 19, 2016. on july 15, 2016, the miso tos filed an appeal of ferc's orders with the sixth circuit. on november 16, 2016, the sixth circuit granted firstenergy's intervention on behalf of atsi, the ohio companies, and pp, and a procedural schedule has been established. on a related issue, firstenergy joined certain other pjm tos in a protest of miso's proposal to allocate mvp costs to energy transactions that cross miso's borders into the pjm region. on july 13, 2016, ferc issued its order finding it appropriate for miso to assess an mvp usage charge for transmission exports from miso to pjm. various parties, including firstenergy and the pjm tos, requested rehearing or clarification of ferc's order. the requests for rehearing remain pending before ferc.
in addition, in a may 31, 2011 order, ferc ruled that the costs for certain "legacy rtep" transmission projects in pjm approved before atsi joined pjm could be charged to transmission customers in the atsi zone. the amount to be paid, and the question of derived benefits, is pending before ferc as a result of the seventh circuit's june 25, 2014 order described above under pjm transmission rates.
the outcome of the proceedings that address the remaining open issues related to costs for the "michigan thumb" transmission project and "legacy rtep" transmission projects cannot be predicted at this time.
transfer of transmission assets to mait on june 10, 2015, mait, a delaware limited liability company, was formed as a new transmission-only subsidiary of fet for the purposes of owning and operating all ferc-jurisdictional transmission assets of jcp&l, me and pn following the receipt of all necessary state and federal regulatory approvals. in february and august 2016, respectively, ferc and the ppuc granted the authorization for pn and me to contribute their transmission assets to mait at book value, together with the approval of related intercompany agreements, including mait's participation in firstenergy's regulated companies' money pool. firstenergy subsequently withdrew its request for authorization before the njbpu to also transfer jcp&l's transmission assets to mait.
on october 28, 2016, mait and pjm submitted joint applications to ferc requesting authorization for (i) pjm to update its tariff and other agreements to reflect the withdrawal of me and pn as tos, and (ii) mait to become a participating pjm to. ferc approval would authorize mait to be a pjm to, and would permit pjm to implement mait's formula rate on mait's behalf. on january 26, 2017, ferc issued an order granting the requested authorization and mait now owns and operates the transmission assets of me and pn. on january 31, 2017, mait issued membership interests to fet, pn and me in exchange for their respective cash and asset contributions.
on october 14 and 28, 2016, mait submitted applications to ferc requesting authorization to issue equity, short-term debt, and long-term debt.  on december 8, 2016, ferc issued an order authorizing the application to issue equity as requested. mait is expected to issue short-term debt and participate in the firstenergy regulated companies' money pool for working capital, to fund day-to-day operations, and for other general corporate purposes. over the long-term, mait is expected to issue long-term debt to support capital investment and to establish an actual capital structure for ratemaking purposes. on february 3, 2017, mait amended
99
its debt authorization application to provide additional information regarding recovery of its investment and debt costs. mait requested an order from ferc on the debt authorization by february 28, 2017. ferc's order remains pending.
mait transmission formula rate on october 28, 2016, mait submitted an application to ferc requesting authorization to implement a forward-looking formula transmission rate to recover and earn a return on transmission assets effective january 1, 2017. on november 30, 2016, various intervenors submitted protests of the proposed mait formula rate. among other things, the protest asked ferc to suspend the proposed effective date for the formula rate until june 1, 2017. mait filed a response to the protests on december 12, 2016. on december 28, 2016, ferc staff issued a deficiency letter with respect to the pjm-related application, which also requested additional information regarding mait's proposed formula rate. as a result of the deficiency letter, ferc's order on the formula rate remains pending. mait responded to ferc staff's request on january 10, 2017, and requested that ferc issue an order approving the formula rate immediately after consummation of the transaction, which occurred on january 31, 2017. on february 15, 2017, mait filed a further answer to certain protesting parties' comments on its january 10th deficiency letter response.
jcp&l transmission formula rate on october 28, 2016, after withdrawing its request to the njbpu to transfer its transmission assets to mait, jcp&l submitted an application to ferc requesting authorization to implement a forward-looking formula transmission rate to recover and earn a return on transmission assets effective january 1, 2017. on november 18, 2016, a group of intervenors-including the njbpu and new jersey division of rate counsel-filed a protest of the proposed jcp&l transmission rate. among other things, the protest asked ferc to suspend the proposed effective date for the formula rate until june 1, 2017. on december 5, 2016, jcp&l filed a response to the protest. on december 28, 2016, ferc staff issued a deficiency letter requesting additional information regarding jcp&l's proposed transmission rate. as a result of the deficiency letter, ferc's order on the rate remains pending. jcp&l responded to ferc staff's request on january 10, 2017, and requested that ferc issue an order approving the formula rate effective january 1, 2017. on february 15, 2017, jcp&l filed a further answer to certain protesting parties' comments on its january 10th deficiency letter response.
competitive generation asset sale on february 17, 2017, ae supply and agc submitted filings with ferc for authorization to sell four natural gas generating plants and an undivided ownership interest in bath county to aspen for approximately $925 million, in an all cash transaction. the four natural gas plants are: springdale generating facility (638 mws), chambersburg generating facility (88 mws), gans generating facility (88 mws), and hunlock creek (45 mws). the 713 mw ownership interest in bath county represents ae supply's indirect ownership interest in the power station. the ferc applications include a request for authorization to transfer the hydroelectric license under part i of the fpa, and a request for authorization to transfer the ferc-jurisdictional facilities associated with the hydroelectric projects under part ii of the fpa. additional filings have been submitted to ferc for the purpose of amending affected ferc-jurisdictional rates and implementing the transaction once regulatory approval is obtained. the vscc also must approve the sale of the bath county hydro interest. the parties expect to close the transaction in the third quarter of 2017, subject to satisfaction of various customary and other closing conditions, including without limitation, receipt of regulatory approvals and third party consents. see "executive summary" above for additional information regarding the transaction.
california claims litigation since 2002, ae supply has been involved in litigation and claims based on its power sales to the california energy resource scheduling division of the cdwr during 2001-2003. this litigation and claims are related to litigation and claims advanced by the california attorney general and certain california utilities regarding alleged market manipulation of the wholesale energy markets in california during the 2000-2001 period. ae supply negotiated a settlement with the california attorney general and the california utilities and, on august 24, 2016, filed the settlement agreement for ferc approval. the settlement calls for ae supply to pay, without admission of any liability, $3.6 million in settlement in principle of all remaining claims that are based on ae supply's power sales in the western energy markets during the 2001-2003 time period. on october 27, 2016 ferc approved this settlement, and ae supply paid the settlement shortly thereafter.
path transmission project on august 24, 2012, the pjm board of managers canceled the path project, a proposed transmission line from west virginia through virginia and into maryland which pjm had previously suspended in february 2011. as a result of pjm canceling the project, approximately $62 million and approximately $59 million in costs incurred by path-allegheny and path-wv, respectively, were reclassified from net property, plant and equipment to a regulatory asset for future recovery. path-allegheny and path-wv requested authorization from ferc to recover the costs with a proposed roe of 10.9% (10.4% base plus 0.5% for rto membership) from pjm customers over five years. ferc issued an order denying the 0.5% roe adder for rto membership and allowing the tariff changes enabling recovery of these costs to become effective on december 1, 2012, subject to settlement proceedings and a hearing if the parties could not agree to a settlement. on march 24, 2014, the ferc chief alj terminated settlement proceedings and appointed an alj to preside over the hearing phase of the case, including discovery and additional pleadings leading up to hearing, which subsequently included the parties addressing the application of ferc's opinion no. 531, discussed below, to the
100
path proceeding. on september 14, 2015, the alj issued his initial decision, disallowing recovery of certain costs. on january 19, 2017, ferc issued an order accepting the initial decision in part and denying it in part. relying on its revised roe methodology described in ferc opinion no. 531, ferc reduced the path formula rate roe from 10.4% to 8.11% effective january 19, 2017. additionally, ferc allowed recovery of costs related to land acquisitions and dispositions and legal expenses, but disallowed certain costs related to advertising and outreach. path filed a request for rehearing with ferc on february 20, 2017, seeking recovery of the advertising and outreach costs and requesting that the roe be reset to 10.4%.
market-based rate authority, triennial update the utilities, ae supply, fes and its subsidiaries, buchanan generation, llc, and green valley hydro, llc each hold authority from ferc to sell electricity at market-based rates. one condition for retaining this authority is that every three years each entity must file an update with the ferc that demonstrates that each entity continues to meet ferc's requirements for holding market-based rate authority. on december 23, 2016, fesc, on behalf of its affiliates with market-based rate authority, submitted to ferc the most recent triennial market power analysis filing for each market-based rate holder for the current cycle of this filing requirement. the filings remain pending before ferc.
environmental matters various federal, state and local authorities regulate firstenergy with regard to air and water quality and other environmental matters. compliance with environmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on firstenergy's earnings and competitive position to the extent that firstenergy competes with companies that are not subject to such regulations and, therefore, do not bear the risk of costs associated with compliance, or failure to comply, with such regulations.
clean air act firstenergy complies with so2 and nox emission reduction requirements under the caa and sip(s) by burning lower-sulfur fuel, utilizing combustion controls and post-combustion controls, generating more electricity from lower or non-emitting plants and/or using emission allowances.
csapr requires reductions of nox and so2 emissions in two phases (2015 and 2017), ultimately capping so2 emissions in affected states to 2.4 million tons annually and nox emissions to 1.2 million tons annually. csapr allows trading of nox and so2 emission allowances between power plants located in the same state and interstate trading of nox and so2 emission allowances with some restrictions. the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit ordered the epa on july 28, 2015, to reconsider the csapr caps on nox and so2 emissions from power plants in 13 states, including ohio, pennsylvania and west virginia. this follows the 2014 u.s. supreme court ruling generally upholding epa's regulatory approach under csapr, but questioning whether epa required upwind states to reduce emissions by more than their contribution to air pollution in downwind states. epa issued a csapr update rule on september 7, 2016, reducing summertime nox emissions from power plants in 22 states in the eastern u.s., including ohio, pennsylvania and west virginia, beginning in 2017. various states and other stakeholders appealed the csapr update rule to the d.c. circuit in november and december 2016. depending on the outcome of the appeals and on how the epa and the states implement csapr, the future cost of compliance may be material and changes to firstenergy's and fes' operations may result.
the epa tightened the primary and secondary naaqs for ozone from the 2008 standard levels of 75 ppb to 70 ppb on october 1, 2015. the epa stated the vast majority of u.s. counties will meet the new 70 ppb standard by 2025 due to other federal and state rules and programs but the epa will designate those counties that fail to attain the new 2015 ozone naaqs by october 1, 2017. states will then have roughly three years to develop implementation plans to attain the new 2015 ozone naaqs. depending on how the epa and the states implement the new 2015 ozone naaqs, the future cost of compliance may be material and changes to firstenergy's and fes' operations may result. in august 2016, the state of delaware filed a caa section 126 petition with the epa alleging that the harrison generating facility's nox emissions significantly contribute to delaware's inability to attain the ozone naaqs. the petition seeks a short term nox emission rate limit of 0.125 lb/mmbtu over an averaging period of no more than 24 hours. on september 27, 2016, the epa extended the time frame for acting on the state of delaware's caa section 126 petition by six months to april 7, 2017. in november 2016, the state of maryland filed a caa section 126 petition with the epa alleging that nox emissions from 36 egus, including harrison units 1, 2 and 3, mansfield unit 1 and pleasants units 1 and 2, significantly contribute to maryland's inability to attain the ozone naaqs. the petition seeks nox emission rate limits for the 36 egus by may 1, 2017. on january 3, 2017, the epa extended the time frame for acting on the caa section 126 petition by six months to july 15, 2017. firstenergy is unable to predict the outcome of these matters or estimate the loss or range of loss.
mats imposes emission limits for mercury, pm, and hcl for all existing and new fossil fuel fired electric generating units effective in april 2015 with averaging of emissions from multiple units located at a single plant. firstenergy's total capital cost for compliance (over the 2012 to 2018 time period) is currently expected to be approximately $345 million (ces segment of $168 million and regulated distribution segment of $177 million), of which $286 million has been spent through december 31, 2016 ($125 million at ces and $161 million at regulated distribution).
on august 3, 2015, fg, a subsidiary of fes, submitted to the aaa office in new york, n.y., a demand for arbitration and statement of claim against bnsf and csx seeking a declaration that mats constituted a force majeure event that excuses fg's performance under its coal transportation contract with these parties. specifically, the dispute arises from a contract for the transportation by
101
bnsf and csx of a minimum of 3.5 million tons of coal annually through 2025 to certain coal-fired power plants owned by fg that are located in ohio. as a result of and in compliance with mats, all plants covered by this contract were deactivated by april 16, 2015. in january 2012, fg notified bnsf and csx that mats constituted a force majeure event under the contract that excused fg's further performance. separately, on august 4, 2015, bnsf and csx submitted to the aaa office in washington, d.c., a demand for arbitration and statement of claim against fg alleging that fg breached the contract and that fg's declaration of a force majeure under the contract is not valid and seeking damages under the contract through 2025. on may 31, 2016, the parties agreed to a stipulation that if fg's force majeure defense is determined to be wholly or partially invalid, liquidated damages are the sole remedy available to bnsf and csx. the arbitration panel consolidated the claims and held a liability hearing from november 28, 2016, through december 9, 2016, and, if necessary, a damages hearing is scheduled to begin on may 8, 2017. the decision on liability is expected to be issued within sixty days from the end of the liability hearing proceedings, which are scheduled to conclude february 24, 2017. firstenergy and fes continue to believe that mats constitutes a force majeure event under the contract as it relates to the deactivated plants and that fg's performance under the contract is therefore excused. fg intends to vigorously assert its position in the arbitration proceedings.  if, however, the arbitration panel rules in favor of bnsf and csx, the results of operations and financial condition of both firstenergy and fes could be materially adversely impacted. refer to the "executive summary" above for possible actions that may be taken by fes in the event of an adverse outcome, including, without limitation, seeking protection under u.s. bankruptcy laws. firstenergy and fes are unable to estimate the loss or range of loss.
on december 22, 2016, fg, a wholly owned subsidiary of fes, received a demand for arbitration and statement of claim from bnsf and ns who are the counterparties to the coal transportation contract covering the delivery of 2.5 million tons annually through 2025, for fg's coal-fired bay shore units 2-4, deactivated on september 1, 2012, as a result of the epa's mats and for fg's w.h. sammis plant. the demand for arbitration was submitted to the aaa office in washington, d.c. against fg alleging, among other things, that fg breached the agreement in 2015 and 2016 and repudiated the agreement for 2017-2025. the counterparties are seeking, among other things, damages, including lost profits through 2025, and a declaratory judgment that fg's claim of force majeure is invalid. fg intends to vigorously assert its position in this arbitration proceeding. if it were ultimately determined that the force majeure provisions or other defenses do not excuse the delivery shortfalls, the results of operations and financial condition of both firstenergy and fes could be materially adversely impacted. refer to the "executive summary" above for possible actions that may be taken by fes in the event of an adverse outcome, including, without limitation, seeking protection under u.s. bankruptcy laws. firstenergy and fes are unable to estimate the loss or range of loss.
as to both coal transportation agreements referenced in the above arbitration proceedings, fg paid approximately $70 million in the aggregate in liquidated damages to settle delivery shortfalls in 2014 related to its deactivated plants, which approximated full liquidated damages under the agreements for such year related to the plant deactivations. liquidated damages for the period 2015-2025 remain in dispute under both coal transportation agreements.
as to a specific coal supply agreement, ae supply asserted termination rights effective in 2015 as a result of mats. in response to notification of the termination, the coal supplier commenced litigation alleging ae supply does not have sufficient justification to terminate the agreement. ae supply has filed an answer denying any liability related to the termination. this matter is currently in the discovery phase of litigation and no trial date has been established. there are approximately 5.5 million tons remaining under the contract for delivery. at this time, ae supply cannot estimate the loss or range of loss regarding the ongoing litigation with respect to this agreement.
in september 2007, ae received an nov from the epa alleging nsr and psd violations under the caa, as well as pennsylvania and west virginia state laws at the coal-fired hatfield's ferry and armstrong plants in pennsylvania and the coal-fired fort martin and willow island plants in west virginia. the epa's nov alleges equipment replacements during maintenance outages triggered the pre-construction permitting requirements under the nsr and psd programs. on june 29, 2012, january 31, 2013, march 27, 2013 and october 18, 2016, epa issued caa section 114 requests for the harrison coal-fired plant seeking information and documentation relevant to its operation and maintenance, including capital projects undertaken since 2007. on december 12, 2014, epa issued a caa section 114 request for the fort martin coal-fired plant seeking information and documentation relevant to its operation and maintenance, including capital projects undertaken since 2009. firstenergy intends to comply with the caa but, at this time, is unable to predict the outcome of this matter or estimate the loss or range of loss.
climate change firstenergy has established a goal to reduce co2 emissions by 90% below 2005 levels by 2045. there are a number of initiatives to reduce ghg emissions at the state, federal and international level. certain northeastern states are participating in the rggi and western states led by california, have implemented programs, primarily cap and trade mechanisms, to control emissions of certain ghgs. additional policies reducing ghg emissions, such as demand reduction programs, renewable portfolio standards and renewable subsidies have been implemented across the nation.
the epa released its final "endangerment and cause or contribute findings for greenhouse gases under the clean air act" in december 2009, concluding that concentrations of several key ghgs constitutes an "endangerment" and may be regulated as "air pollutants" under the caa and mandated measurement and reporting of ghg emissions from certain sources, including electric generating plants. on june 23, 2014, the united states supreme court decided that co2 or other ghg emissions alone cannot trigger permitting requirements under the caa, but that air emission sources that need psd permits due to other regulated air pollutants can be required by the epa to install ghg control technologies. the epa released its final regulations in august 2015
102
(which have been stayed by the u.s. supreme court), to reduce co2 emissions from existing fossil fuel fired electric generating units that would require each state to develop sips by september 6, 2016, to meet the epa's state specific co2 emission rate goals. the epa's cpp allows states to request a two-year extension to finalize sips by september 6, 2018. if states fail to develop sips, the epa also proposed a federal implementation plan that can be implemented by the epa that included model emissions trading rules which states can also adopt in their sips. the epa also finalized separate regulations imposing co2 emission limits for new, modified, and reconstructed fossil fuel fired electric generating units. numerous states and private parties filed appeals and motions to stay the cpp with the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit in october 2015. on january 21, 2016, a panel of the d.c. circuit denied the motions for stay and set an expedited schedule for briefing and argument. on february 9, 2016, the u.s. supreme court stayed the rule during the pendency of the challenges to the d.c. circuit and u.s. supreme court. depending on the outcome of further appeals and how any final rules are ultimately implemented, the future cost of compliance may be material.
at the international level, the united nations framework convention on climate change resulted in the kyoto protocol requiring participating countries, which does not include the u.s., to reduce ghgs commencing in 2008 and has been extended through 2020. the obama administration submitted in march 2015, a formal pledge for the u.s. to reduce its economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 and joined in adopting the agreement reached on december 12, 2015 at the united nations framework convention on climate change meetings in paris. the paris agreement was ratified by the requisite number of countries (i.e. at least 55 countries representing at least 55% of global ghg emissions) in october 2016 and its non-binding obligations to limit global warming to well below two degrees celsius are effective on november 4, 2016. it remains unclear whether and how the results of the 2016 united states election could impact the regulation of ghg emissions at the federal and state level. firstenergy cannot currently estimate the financial impact of climate change policies, although potential legislative or regulatory programs restricting co2 emissions, or litigation alleging damages from ghg emissions, could require material capital and other expenditures or result in changes to its operations. the co2 emissions per kwh of electricity generated by firstenergy is lower than many of its regional competitors due to its diversified generation sources, which include low or non-co2 emitting gas-fired and nuclear generators.
clean water act various water quality regulations, the majority of which are the result of the federal cwa and its amendments, apply to firstenergy's plants. in addition, the states in which firstenergy operates have water quality standards applicable to firstenergy's operations.
the epa finalized cwa section 316(b) regulations in may 2014, requiring cooling water intake structures with an intake velocity greater than 0.5 feet per second to reduce fish impingement when aquatic organisms are pinned against screens or other parts of a cooling water intake system to a 12% annual average and requiring cooling water intake structures exceeding 125 million gallons per day to conduct studies to determine site-specific controls, if any, to reduce entrainment, which occurs when aquatic life is drawn into a facility's cooling water system. firstenergy is studying various control options and their costs and effectiveness, including pilot testing of reverse louvers in a portion of the bay shore plant's cooling water intake channel to divert fish away from the plant's cooling water intake system. depending on the results of such studies and any final action taken by the states based on those studies, the future capital costs of compliance with these standards may be material.
on september 30, 2015, the epa finalized new, more stringent effluent limits for the steam electric power generating category (40 cfr part 423) for arsenic, mercury, selenium and nitrogen for wastewater from wet scrubber systems and zero discharge of pollutants in ash transport water. the treatment obligations will phase-in as permits are renewed on a five-year cycle from 2018 to 2023. the final rule also allows plants to commit to more stringent effluent limits for wet scrubber systems based on evaporative technology and in return have until the end of 2023 to meet the more stringent limits. depending on the outcome of appeals and how any final rules are ultimately implemented, the future costs of compliance with these standards may be substantial and changes to firstenergy's and fes' operations may result.
in october 2009, the wvdep issued an npdes water discharge permit for the fort martin plant, which imposes tds, sulfate concentrations and other effluent limitations for heavy metals, as well as temperature limitations. concurrent with the issuance of the fort martin npdes permit, wvdep also issued an administrative order setting deadlines for mp to meet certain of the effluent limits that were effective immediately under the terms of the npdes permit. mp appealed, and a stay of certain conditions of the npdes permit and order have been granted pending a final decision on the appeal and subject to wvdep moving to dissolve the stay. the fort martin npdes permit could require an initial capital investment ranging from $150 million to $300 million in order to install technology to meet the tds and sulfate limits, which technology may also meet certain of the other effluent limits. additional technology may be needed to meet certain other limits in the fort martin npdes permit. mp intends to vigorously pursue these issues but cannot predict the outcome of the appeal or estimate the possible loss or range of loss.
firstenergy intends to vigorously defend against the cwa matters described above but, except as indicated above, cannot predict their outcomes or estimate the loss or range of loss.
regulation of waste disposal federal and state hazardous waste regulations have been promulgated as a result of the rcra, as amended, and the toxic substances control act. certain coal combustion residuals, such as coal ash, were exempted from hazardous waste disposal requirements pending the epa's evaluation of the need for future regulation.
103
in december 2014, the epa finalized regulations for the disposal of ccrs (non-hazardous), establishing national standards regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring and protection procedures and other operational and reporting procedures to assure the safe disposal of ccrs from electric generating plants. based on an assessment of the finalized regulations, the future cost of compliance and expected timing of spend had no significant impact on firstenergy's or fes' existing aros associated with ccrs. although not currently expected, any changes in timing and closure plan requirements in the future, including changes resulting from the strategic review at ces, could materially and adversely impact firstenergy's and fes' aros.
pursuant to a 2013 consent decree, pa dep issued a 2014 permit for the little blue run ccr impoundment requiring the bruce mansfield plant to cease disposal of ccrs by december 31, 2016 and fg to provide bonding for 45 years of closure and post-closure activities and to complete closure within a 12-year period, but authorizing fg to seek a permit modification based on "unexpected site conditions that have or will slow closure progress." the permit does not require active dewatering of the ccrs, but does require a groundwater assessment for arsenic and abatement if certain conditions in the permit are met. the ccrs from the bruce mansfield plant are being beneficially reused with the majority used for reclamation of a site owned by the marshall county coal company in moundsville, w. va. and the remainder recycled into drywall by national gypsum. these beneficial reuse options should be sufficient for ongoing plant operations, however, the bruce mansfield plant is pursuing other options. on may 22, 2015 and september 21, 2015, the pa dep reissued a permit for the hatfield's ferry ccr disposal facility and then modified that permit to allow disposal of bruce mansfield plant ccr. on july 6, 2015 and october 22, 2015, the sierra club filed notices of appeal with the pennsylvania environmental hearing board challenging the renewal, reissuance and modification of the permit for the hatfield's ferry ccr disposal facility.
firstenergy or its subsidiaries have been named as potentially responsible parties at waste disposal sites, which may require cleanup under the cercla. allegations of disposal of hazardous substances at historical sites and the liability involved are often unsubstantiated and subject to dispute; however, federal law provides that all potentially responsible parties for a particular site may be liable on a joint and several basis. environmental liabilities that are considered probable have been recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2016 based on estimates of the total costs of cleanup, fe's and its subsidiaries' proportionate responsibility for such costs and the financial ability of other unaffiliated entities to pay. total liabilities of approximately $137 million have been accrued through december 31, 2016. included in the total are accrued liabilities of approximately $89 million for environmental remediation of former manufactured gas plants and gas holder facilities in new jersey, which are being recovered by jcp&l through a non-bypassable sbc. firstenergy or its subsidiaries could be found potentially responsible for additional amounts or additional sites, but the loss or range of loss cannot be determined or reasonably estimated at this time.
other legal proceedings nuclear plant matters under nrc regulations, firstenergy must ensure that adequate funds will be available to decommission its nuclear facilities. as of december 31, 2016, firstenergy had approximately $2.5 billion invested in external trusts to be used for the decommissioning and environmental remediation of davis-besse, beaver valley, perry and tmi-2. the values of firstenergy's ndts fluctuate based on market conditions. if the value of the trusts decline by a material amount, firstenergy's obligation to fund the trusts may increase. disruptions in the capital markets and their effects on particular businesses and the economy could also affect the values of the ndts. fe and fes have also entered into a total of  $24.5 million in parental guarantees in support of the decommissioning of the spent fuel storage facilities located at the nuclear facilities. as fes no longer maintains investment grade credit ratings from either s&p or moody's, ng funded a $10 million supplemental trust in 2016 in lieu of the fes parental guarantee that would be required to support the decommissioning of the spent fuel storage facilities. the termination of the fes parental guarantee is subject to nrc review. as required by the nrc, firstenergy annually recalculates and adjusts the amount of its parental guarantees, as appropriate.
as part of routine inspections of the concrete shield building at davis-besse in 2013, fenoc identified changes to the subsurface laminar cracking condition originally discovered in 2011. these inspections revealed that the cracking condition had propagated a small amount in select areas. fenoc's analysis confirms that the building continues to maintain its structural integrity, and its ability to safely perform all of its functions. in a may 28, 2015, inspection report regarding the apparent cause evaluation on crack propagation, the nrc issued a non-cited violation for fenoc's failure to request and obtain a license amendment for its method of evaluating the significance of the shield building cracking. the nrc also concluded that the shield building remained capable of performing its design safety functions despite the identified laminar cracking and that this issue was of very low safety significance. fenoc plans to submit a license amendment application to the nrc related to the laminar cracking in the shield building.
on march 12, 2012, the nrc issued orders requiring safety enhancements at u.s. reactors based on recommendations from the lessons learned task force review of the accident at japan's fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant. these orders require additional mitigation strategies for beyond-design-basis external events, and enhanced equipment for monitoring water levels in spent fuel pools. the nrc also requested that licensees including fenoc re-analyze earthquake and flooding risks using the latest information available, conduct earthquake and flooding hazard walkdowns at their nuclear plants, assess the ability of current communications systems and equipment to perform under a prolonged loss of onsite and offsite electrical power and assess plant staffing levels needed to fill emergency positions. although a majority of the necessary modifications and upgrades at firstenergy's nuclear facilities have been implemented, the improvements still remain subject to regulatory approval.
104
fes provides a parental support agreement to ng of up to $400 million. the nrc typically relies on such parental support agreements to provide additional assurance that u.s. merchant nuclear plants, including ng's nuclear units have the necessary financial resources to maintain safe operations, particularly in the event of extraordinary circumstances. in addition to the $500 million credit facility with fe discussed above, fe is working with fes to establish conditional credit support on terms and conditions to be agreed upon for the $400 million fes parental support agreement that is currently in place for the benefit of ng in the event that fes is unable to provide the necessary support to ng.
other legal matters there are various lawsuits, claims (including claims for asbestos exposure) and proceedings related to firstenergy's normal business operations pending against firstenergy and its subsidiaries. the loss or range of loss in these matters is not expected to be material to firstenergy or its subsidiaries. the other potentially material items not otherwise discussed above are described under note 15, regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements.
firstenergy accrues legal liabilities only when it concludes that it is probable that it has an obligation for such costs and can reasonably estimate the amount of such costs. in cases where firstenergy determines that it is not probable, but reasonably possible that it has a material obligation, it discloses such obligations and the possible loss or range of loss if such estimate can be made. if it were ultimately determined that firstenergy or its subsidiaries have legal liability or are otherwise made subject to liability based on any of the matters referenced above, it could have a material adverse effect on firstenergy's or its subsidiaries' financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
critical accounting policies and estimates firstenergy prepares consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap. application of these principles often requires a high degree of judgment, estimates and assumptions that affect financial results. firstenergy's accounting policies require significant judgment regarding estimates and assumptions underlying the amounts included in the financial statements. additional information regarding the application of accounting policies is included in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition firstenergy follows the accrual method of accounting for revenues, recognizing revenue for electricity that has been delivered to customers but not yet billed through the end of the accounting period. the determination of electricity sales to individual customers is based on meter readings, which occur on a systematic basis throughout the month. at the end of each month, electricity delivered to customers since the last meter reading is estimated and a corresponding accrual for unbilled sales is recognized. the determination of unbilled sales and revenues requires management to make estimates regarding electricity available for retail load, transmission and distribution line losses, demand by customer class, applicable billing demands, weather-related impacts, number of days unbilled and tariff rates in effect within each customer class. see note 1, organization and basis of presentation for additional details.
regulatory accounting firstenergy's regulated distribution and regulated transmission segments are subject to regulations that set the prices (rates) the utilities, atsi, trail and path are permitted to charge customers based on costs that the regulatory agencies determine are permitted to be recovered. at times, regulators permit the future recovery through rates of costs that would be currently charged to expense by an unregulated company. this ratemaking process results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities based on anticipated future cash inflows and outflows. firstenergy regularly reviews these assets to assess their ultimate recoverability within the approved regulatory guidelines. impairment risk associated with these assets relates to potentially adverse legislative, judicial or regulatory actions in the future. see note 15, regulatory matters for additional information.
firstenergy reviews the probability of recovery of regulatory assets at each balance sheet date and whenever new events occur. similarly, firstenergy records regulatory liabilities when a determination is made that a refund is probable or when ordered by a commission. factors that may affect probability include changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of a regulatory commission order or passage of new legislation. if recovery of a regulatory asset is no longer probable, firstenergy will write off that regulatory asset as a charge against earnings.
pension and opeb accounting firstenergy provides noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all of its employees and non-qualified pension plans that cover certain employees. the plans provide defined benefits based on years of service and compensation levels.
firstenergy provides some non-contributory pre-retirement basic life insurance for employees who are eligible to retire. health care benefits and/or subsidies to purchase health insurance, which include certain employee contributions, deductibles and co-payments, may also be available upon retirement to certain employees, their dependents and, under certain circumstances, their survivors.
105
firstenergy also has obligations to former or inactive employees after employment, but before retirement, for disability-related benefits.
in 2016, firstenergy satisfied its minimum required funding obligations of $382 million and addressed funding obligations for future years to its qualified pension plan with total contributions of $882 million (of which $138 million was cash contributions from fes), including $500 million of fe common stock contributed to the qualified pension plan on december 13, 2016. the independent fiduciary representing the pension plan with respect to the equity contribution fully liquidated the fe common stock by january 31, 2017.
firstenergy recognizes a pension and opeb mark-to-market adjustment for the change in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement. the remaining components of pension and opeb expense, primarily service costs, interest on obligations, assumed return on assets and prior service costs, are recorded on a monthly basis. the pension and opeb mark-to-market adjustment for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $194 million ($147 million net of amounts capitalized), $369 million ($242 million net of amounts capitalized), and $1,243 million ($835 million net of amounts capitalized), respectively.
in selecting an assumed discount rate, firstenergy considers currently available rates of return on high-quality fixed income investments expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension and opeb obligations. the assumed discount rates for pension were 4.25%, 4.50% and 4.25% as of december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the assumed discount rates for opeb were 4.00%, 4.25% and 4.00% as of december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
firstenergy's assumed rate of return on pension plan assets considers historical market returns and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the pension trusts. in 2016, firstenergy's qualified pension and opeb plan assets experienced earnings of $472 million or 8.2% compared to losses of $(172) million, or (2.7)% in 2015 and earnings of $387 million, or 6.2% in 2014 and assumed a 7.50% rate of return on plan assets in 2016 and a 7.75% expected rate of return in 2015 and 2014 which generated $429 million, $476 million and $496 million of expected returns on plan assets, respectively. the expected return on pension and opeb assets is based on the trusts' asset allocation targets and the historical performance of risk-based and fixed income securities. the gains or losses generated as a result of the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets will increase or decrease future net periodic pension and opeb cost as the difference is recognized annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever a plan is determined to qualify for remeasurement. the expected return on plan assets for 2017 is 7.5%.
during 2016, the society of actuaries released its updated mortality improvement scale for pension plans, mp-2016, incorporating three additional years of ssa data on u.s. population mortality. mp-2016 incorporates ssa mortality data from 2012 to 2014 and a slight modification of two input values designed to improve the model's year-over-year stability. the updated improvement scale indicates a slight decline in life expectancy as a result of the slower average rate of mortality improvement. due to the additional years of data on population mortality, the rp2014 mortality table with the projection scale mp-2016 was utilized to determine the 2016 benefit cost and obligation as of december 31, 2016 for the firstenergy pension and opeb plans.the impact of using the projection scale mp-2016 resulted in a decrease in the projected benefit obligation of $141 million and $8 million for the pension and opeb plans, respectively, and was included in the 2016 pension and opeb mark-to-market adjustment.
based on discount rates of 4.25% for pension, 4.00% for opeb and an estimated return on assets of 7.5%, firstenergy expects its 2017 pre-tax net periodic benefit cost (including amounts capitalized) to be approximately $78 million (excluding any actuarial mark-to-market adjustments that would be recognized in 2017). the following table reflects the portion of pension and opeb costs that were charged to expense, including any pension and opeb mark-to-market adjustments, in the three years ended december 31, 2016.

health care cost trends continue to increase and will affect future opeb costs. the 2016 composite health care trend rate assumptions were approximately 6.0-5.5%, compared to 6.0-5.5% in 2015, gradually decreasing to 4.5% in later years. in determining firstenergy's trend rate assumptions, included are the specific provisions of firstenergy's health care plans, the demographics and utilization rates of plan participants, actual cost increases experienced in firstenergy's health care plans, and projections of future medical trend rates. the effects on 2017 pension and opeb net periodic benefit costs from changes in key assumptions are as follows:

see note 4, pension and other postemployment benefits for additional information long-lived assets firstenergy evaluates long-lived assets classified as held and used for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the long-lived assets may not be recoverable. first, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets is compared with the carrying value of the assets. if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount the carrying value of the assets exceeds its estimated fair value. see note 1, organization and basis of presentation.
see note 2, asset impairments for impairments recognized during 2016 and 2015.
asset retirement obligations fe recognizes an aro for the future decommissioning of its nuclear power plants and future remediation of other environmental liabilities associated with all of its long-lived assets. the aro liability represents an estimate of the fair value of fe's current obligation related to nuclear decommissioning and the retirement or remediation of environmental liabilities of other assets. a fair value measurement inherently involves uncertainty in the amount and timing of settlement of the liability. fe uses an expected cash flow approach to measure the fair value of the nuclear decommissioning and environmental remediation aro. this approach applies probability weighting to discounted future cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes. the scenarios consider settlement of the aro at the expiration of the nuclear power plant's current license, settlement based on an extended license term and expected remediation dates. the fair value of an aro is recognized in the period in which it is incurred. the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the long-lived asset and are depreciated over the life of the related asset.
conditional retirement obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets are recognized at fair value in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate can be made, even though there may be uncertainty about timing or method of settlement. when settlement is conditional on a future event occurring, it is reflected in the measurement of the liability, not the timing of the liability recognition.
aros as of december 31, 2016, are described further in "note 14, asset retirement obligations".
income taxes firstenergy records income taxes in accordance with the liability method of accounting. deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts recognized for tax purposes. investment tax credits, which were deferred when utilized, are being amortized over the recovery period of the related property. deferred income tax liabilities related to temporary tax and accounting basis differences and tax credit carryforward items are recognized at the statutory income tax rates in effect when the liabilities are expected to be paid. deferred tax assets are recognized based on income tax rates expected to be in effect when they are settled.
firstenergy accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in its financial statements. we account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach, a more-likely-than-not recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being ultimately realized upon settlement. if it is not more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit will be recorded. uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. firstenergy recognizes interest expense or income related to uncertain tax positions. that amount is computed by applying the applicable statutory interest rate to the difference between the tax position recognized and the amount previously taken or expected to be taken on the tax return. firstenergy includes net interest and penalties in the provision for income taxes. see note 6, taxes for additional information.
107
goodwill in a business combination, the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. firstenergy evaluates goodwill for impairment annually on july 31 and more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. in evaluating goodwill for impairment, firstenergy assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value (including goodwill). if firstenergy concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then no further testing is required. however, if firstenergy concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or bypasses the qualitative assessment, then the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed to identify a potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of impairment to be recognized, if any.
as of july 31, 2016, firstenergy performed a qualitative assessment of the regulated distribution and regulated transmission reporting units' goodwill, assessing economic, industry and market considerations in addition to the reporting units' overall financial performance. it was determined that the fair value of these reporting units were, more likely than not, greater than their carrying value and a quantitative analysis was not necessary.

new accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers". subsequent accounting standards updates have been issued which amend and/or clarify the application of asu 2014-09. the core principle of the new guidance is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. more detailed disclosures will also be required to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. for public business entities, the new revenue recognition guidance will be effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. earlier adoption is permitted for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016. firstenergy will not early adopt the standards. the standards shall be applied retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. firstenergy has evaluated a significant portion of its revenues and preliminarily expects limited impacts to current revenue recognition practices, dependent on the resolution of industry issues including accounting for contributions in aid of construction and the ability to recognize revenue for contracts where collectibility is in question. firstenergy continues to assess the remainder of its revenue streams and the impact on its financial statements and disclosures as well as which transition method it will select to adopt the guidance.
on august 27, 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-15, "disclosure of uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern." in connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, the asu requires an entity's management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. disclosures are required when management identifies conditions or events that raise substantial doubt. the new requirements were effective for the annual period ended december 31, 2016.
in january of 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-01, "financial instruments-overall: recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities", which primarily affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. in addition, the fasb clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. the asu will be effective in fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. early adoption for certain provisions can be elected for all financial statements of fiscal years and interim periods that have not yet been issued or that have not yet been made available for issuance. firstenergy is currently evaluating the impact on its financial statements of adopting this standard.
in february 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-02, "leases (topic 842)", which will require organizations that lease assets with lease terms of more than twelve months to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases on their balance sheets. in addition, new qualitative and quantitative disclosures of the amounts, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases will be required. the asu will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. lessors and lessees will be required to apply a modified retrospective transition approach, which requires adjusting the accounting for any leases existing at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the adoption-period financial statements. any leases that expire before the initial application date will not require any accounting adjustment. firstenergy is currently evaluating the impact on its financial statements of adopting this standard.
in march of 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-09, "improvements to employee share-based payment accounting", which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment. the new guidance will require all income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. it also will not require liability accounting when an employer repurchases more of an employee's shares for tax withholding purposes. the asu will be effective for fiscal
108
years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. upon adoption, january 1, 2017, firstenergy elected to account for forfeitures as they occur. the adoption of the asu did not have a material impact on firstenergy's financial statements.
in june 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-13, "financial instruments - credit losses (topic 326): measurement of credit losses on financial instruments", which removes all recognition thresholds and will require companies to recognize an allowance for credit losses for the difference between the amortized cost basis of a financial instrument and the amount of amortized cost that the company expects to collect over the instrument's contractual life. the asu is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2019. early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018. firstenergy is currently evaluating the impact on its financial statements of adopting this standard.
in august 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-15, "statement of cash flows (topic 230): classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments". the standard is intended to eliminate diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows, including the presentation of debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, all of which will be classified as financing activities. the guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is permitted for all entities. firstenergy expects to adopt this asu in 2017 and does not expect this asu to have a material effect on its financial statements.
in october 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-16, " accounting for income taxes: intra-entity asset transfers of assets other than inventory". asu 2016-16 eliminates the exception for all intra-entity sales of assets other than inventory, which allows companies to defer the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers. as a result, a reporting entity would recognize the tax expense from the sale of the asset in the seller's tax jurisdiction when the intra-entity transfer occurs, even though the pre-tax effects of that transaction are eliminated in consolidation. any deferred tax asset that arises in the buyer's jurisdiction would also be recognized at the time of the transfer. the guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is permitted and the modified retrospective approach will be required for transition to the new guidance, with a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded in retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. firstenergy is currently evaluating the impact on its financial statements of adopting this standard.
in november 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-18, "restricted cash" that will require entities to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. as a result, entities will no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. when cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are presented in more than one line item on the balance sheet, the new guidance requires a reconciliation of the totals in the statement of cash flows to the related captions in the balance sheet. the guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2019. early adoption in an interim period is permitted, but any adjustments must be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. firstenergy does not expect this asu to have a material effect on its financial statements.
additionally, during 2016, the fasb issued the following asus:
•   asu 2016-05, "effect of derivative contract novations on existing hedge accounting relationships,"
•   asu 2016-06, "contingent put and call options in debt instruments (a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force),"
•   asu 2016-07, "simplifying the transition to the equity method of accounting," and
•   asu 2016-17, "consolidation (topic 810): interests held through related parties that are under common control."
firstenergy does not expect these asus to have a material effect on its financial statements.

firstenergy solutions corp.
management's narrative analysis of results of operations fes, a subsidiary of fe, was organized under the laws of the state of ohio in 1997. fes provides energy-related products and services to retail and wholesale customers. fes also owns and operates, through its fg subsidiary, fossil generating facilities and owns, through its ng subsidiary, nuclear generating facilities. fes purchases the entire output of the generation facilities owned by fg and ng, and purchases the uncommitted output of ae supply, as well as the output relating to leasehold interests of oe and te in certain of those facilities that are subject to sale and leaseback arrangements, and pursuant to full output, cost-of-service psas. prior to april 1, 2016, fes financially purchased the uncommitted output of ae supply's generation facilities under a psa. on december 21, 2015, fes agreed, under a psa, to physically purchase all the output of ae supply's generation facilities effective april 1, 2016. fes and ae supply are evaluating the possible termination of the psa.
fes' revenues are derived primarily from sales to individual retail customers, sales to customers in the form of governmental aggregation programs, and participation in affiliated and non-affiliated polr auctions. fes' sales are primarily concentrated in ohio, pennsylvania, illinois, michigan, new jersey, and maryland. the demand for electricity produced and sold by fes, along with the price of that electricity, is principally impacted by conditions in competitive power markets, global economic activity as well as economic activity and weather conditions in the midwest and mid-atlantic regions of the united states.
fes is exposed to various market and financial risks, including the risk of price fluctuations in the wholesale power markets. wholesale power prices may be impacted by the prices of other commodities, including coal and natural gas, and energy efficiency and dr programs, as well as regulatory and legislative actions, such as mats among other factors. fes attempts to mitigate the market risk inherent in its energy position by economically hedging its exposure and continuously monitoring various risk measurement metrics to ensure compliance with its risk management policies.
today, fes' competitive generation portfolio is comprised of more than 10,000 mws of generation, primarily from coal, nuclear and natural gas and oil fuel sources. the assets generate approximately 60-65 million mwhs annually, with up to an additional 15 million mwhs available from purchased power agreements for wind, solar, fes' entitlement in ovec and, as discussed above, fes' psa with ae supply.
over the past several years, fes has been impacted by a prolonged decrease in demand and excess generation supply in the pjm region, which has resulted in a period of protracted low power and capacity prices. to address this, fes sold or deactivated approximately 2,700 mws of competitive generation from 2012 to 2015. additionally, fes has continued to focus on cost reductions, including those identified as part of firstenergy's previously disclosed cash flow improvement plan.
however, the energy and capacity markets continue to be weak, as evidenced by the significantly depressed capacity prices from the 2019/2020 pjm base residual auction in may of 2016 as well as the current forward pricing and the long-term fundamental view on energy and capacity prices, which resulted in a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $23 million recognized in the second quarter of 2016 representing the total amount of goodwill at fes.
as part of a continual process to evaluate its overall generation business, on july 22, 2016, firstenergy announced its intent to exit the 136 mw bay shore unit 1 generating station by october 2020 and to deactivate units 1-4 of the w.h. sammis generating station totaling 720 mws by may 2020, resulting in a $517 million non-cash pre-tax impairment charge in the second quarter of 2016. furthermore, in november of 2016, firstenergy announced that it had begun a strategic review of its competitive operations, including fes, as it transitions to a fully regulated utility with a target to implement its exit from competitive operations by mid-2018.
although firstenergy is targeting mid-2018 to exit from competitive operations, the options to exit are still uncertain, but could include one or more of the following:
•   legislative or regulatory solutions for generation assets that recognize their environmental or energy security benefits,
•   additional asset sales and/or plant deactivations,
•   restructuring fes debt with its creditors, and/or
•   seeking protection under u.s. bankruptcy laws for fes and possibly fenoc.
furthermore, adverse outcomes in previously disclosed disputes regarding long term-coal transportation contracts and/or the inability to extend or refinance debt maturities at fes subsidiaries, could accelerate management's targeted timeline and limit its options to exit competitive operations at fes to either restructuring debt with fes' creditors or seeking protection under u.s. bankruptcy laws.
as part of assessing the viability of strategic alternatives, firstenergy determined that the carrying value of long-lived assets of the competitive business were not recoverable, specifically given firstenergy's target to implement its exit from competitive operations by mid-2018, significantly before the end of their original useful lives, and the anticipated cash flows over this shortened period.  as a result, fes recorded a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $8,082 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 to reduce the carrying
110
value of certain assets to their estimated fair value, including long-lived assets such as generating plants and nuclear fuel, as well as other assets such as materials and supplies.
fes continues to be managed conservatively due to the stress of weak energy prices, insufficient results from recent capacity auctions and anemic demand forecasts that have lowered the value of the business. furthermore, the credit quality of fes, specifically its unsecured debt rating of caa1 at moody's, ccc+ at s&p and c at fitch and negative outlook from each of the rating agencies has challenged its ability to hedge generation with retail and forward wholesale sales due to collateral requirements that otherwise would reduce available liquidity. a lack of viable alternative strategies for its competitive portfolio has and would further stress the financial condition of fes. as a result, fes' contract sales are expected to decline from 52 million mwhs in 2016 to 40-45 million mwhs in 2017, and to 35-40 million mwhs in 2018. while the reduced contract sales will decrease potential collateral requirements, market price volatility may significantly impact fes' financial results due to the increased exposure to the wholesale spot market.
as previously disclosed, fes has $130 million of debt maturities that need to be refinanced in 2017 (and $515 million of maturing debt in 2018 beginning in the second quarter). based on its current senior unsecured debt rating and current capital structure, reflecting the impact of the impairment charges discussed above, as well as the forecasted decline in wholesale forward market prices over the next few years, these debt maturities will be difficult to refinance, even on a secured basis, which would further stress fes' anticipated liquidity. furthermore, lack of clarity regarding the timing and viability of alternative strategies, including additional asset sales or deactivations and/or converting generation from competitive operations to a regulated or regulated-like construct in a way that provides fes with the means to satisfy its obligations over the long-term may require fes to restructure debt and other financial obligations with its creditors or seek protection under u.s bankruptcy laws.  although management is exploring capital and other cost reductions, asset sales, and other options to improve cash flow as well as continuing with legislative efforts to explore a regulatory solution, these obligations and their impact on liquidity raise substantial doubt about fes' ability to meet its obligations as they come due over the next twelve months and, as such, its ability to continue as a going concern.
for additional information with respect to fes, please see the information contained in firstenergy's management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the following subheadings, which information is incorporated by reference herein: firstenergy's business and executive summary, capital resources and liquidity, guarantees and other assurances, off-balance sheet arrangements, market risk information, credit risk and outlook.
results of operations operating results decreased $5,537 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily resulting from the asset impairment charges discussed above. in addition to the asset impairment charges, operating results were impacted by lower mark-to-market gains on commodity contract positions, a lower pension and opeb mark-to-market adjustment and higher settlement and termination costs related to coal contracts. excluding these items, year-over-year operating results were impacted by lower sales volumes, a termination charge associated with an fes customer contract, and higher retirement and employee benefit costs, partially offset by higher capacity revenue and lower fuel, transmission and purchased power costs.
revenues -
total revenues decreased $607 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to lower sales volumes. revenues were also impacted by higher capacity revenues, an increase in short-term (net hourly position) transactions at higher rates, and higher net gains on financially settled contracts, as further described below.
the change in total revenues resulted from the following sources:

lower sales volumes in the direct, governmental aggregation and mass market sales channels primarily reflects the continuation of fes' strategy to more effectively hedge its generation, as discussed above. the direct, governmental aggregation and mass market customer base was 1.1 million as of december 31, 2016, compared to 1.6 million as of december 31, 2015. although unit pricing was lower year-over-year in the direct and governmental aggregation channels, the decrease was primarily attributable to lower capacity expense, as discussed below, which is a component of the retail price.
the decrease in polr sales of $129 million was primarily due to lower volumes. structured sales decreased $95 million, primarily due to the impact of lower market prices and lower structured transaction volumes.
wholesale revenues increased $448 million, primarily due to an increase in short-term (net hourly position) transactions at higher rates, an increase in capacity revenue, and higher net gains on financially settled contracts. capacity revenue increased as a result of a change in a psa between fes and ae supply, as discussed above.
transmission revenue decreased $52 million, primarily due to lower congestion revenues associated with less volatile market conditions.
other revenues decreased $28 million, primarily due to the absence of a gain on the sale of property to a regulated affiliate in 2015 and lower lease revenues from the expiration of a nuclear sale-leaseback agreement.
operating expenses -
total operating expenses increased $8,067 million in 2016 compared to 2015.

fossil and nuclear fuel costs decreased $91 million, primarily due to lower generation associated with outages and economic dispatch of fossil units resulting from low wholesale spot market energy prices, as described above, as well as lower unit prices on fossil fuel contracts. additionally, fuel costs were impacted by higher settlement and termination costs on coal contracts.
affiliated purchased power costs increased $271 million, primarily associated with lower net gains on settled contracts with ae supply resulting from lower wholesale spot market prices.
non-affiliated purchased power costs decreased $664 million due to lower volumes ($409 million), lower prices ($21 million) and lower capacity expenses ($234 million). lower volumes primarily resulted from lower contract sales, as discussed above, partially offset by higher economic purchases resulting from the low wholesale spot market energy price environment. the decrease in capacity expense was primarily the result of lower contract sales and lower capacity rates associated with fes' retail sales obligations.
other operating expenses decreased $31 million in 2016, compared to 2015 due to the following:
•   fossil operating costs decreased $12 million, primarily as a result of the deactivation of certain fossil plants in 2015, partially offset by increased outage costs and higher employee benefit costs
•   nuclear operating costs decreased $39 million, primarily as a result of lower refueling outage costs, partially offset by higher employee benefit costs. there were two refueling outages in 2016 as compared to three refueling outages in 2015.
•   retirement benefit costs increased $30 million.
•   transmission expenses decreased $145 million, primarily due to lower congestion and market-based ancillary costs associated with less volatile market conditions as compared to 2015, as well as lower load requirements.
•   other operating expenses increased $135 million, primarily due to lower mark-to-market gains on commodity contract positions of $85 million and a $37 million charge associated with the termination of an fes customer contract.
the pension and opeb mark-to-market adjustment decreased $9 million to $48 million in 2016. the 2016 adjustment resulted from a 25 bps decrease in the discount rate, partially offset by higher than expected asset returns and changes in other actuarial assumptions.
depreciation expense increased $12 million, primarily as a result of a higher asset base.
general taxes decreased $10 million, primarily due to lower gross receipts taxes associated with lower retail sales volumes.
impairment of assets increased $8,589 million, primarily due to impairments of the competitive generation assets discussed above.
other expense -
total other expense decreased $84 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to lower otti on ndt investments.
income taxes (benefits) -
fes' effective tax rate was 35.4% and 44.2% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. the decrease in the effective tax rate on pre-tax losses is primarily due to valuation allowances of $151 million recorded against state and local nol carryforwards that management believes, more likely than not, will not be realized as well as the impairment of $23 million of goodwill which is non-deductible for tax purposes.

changes in cash position fes expects to rely primarily on internal sources of funds, specifically a two-year secured line of credit with fe of up to $500 million, as further described below. additionally, fes subsidiaries have debt maturities in 2017 and 2018 of $130 million and $515 million, respectively. the inability to refinance such debt maturities at fes could cause fes to take one or more of the following actions: (i) restructuring of debt and other financial obligations, (ii) additional borrowings under its credit facility with fe, (iii) further asset sales or plant deactivations, and/or (iv) seek protection under bankruptcy laws. in the event fes seeks such protection, fenoc may similarly seek protection under bankruptcy laws.
fes and ae supply terminated their unsecured $1.5 billion credit facility (commitments of $900 million and $600 million for fes and ae supply, respectively) and fes entered into a new, two-year secured credit facility with fe in which fe provided a committed line of credit to fes of up to $500 million and additional credit support of up to $200 million to cover a $169 million surety bond for the benefit of the pa dep with respect to lbr, and other bonds as designated in writing to fe. in connection with the cancellation of the prior fes/ae supply facility and entry into the new fes secured facility with fe, certain commitments and amendments associated with shared services and operational matters were made including, without limitation, as follows: (i) fe reaffirmed its obligations under the intercompany tax allocation agreement, and (ii) amendments to the service agreement by and among fesc, fes, fg and ng, to prevent termination until the earlier of december 31, 2018, or a change in control of fes or its subsidiaries. in addition, a separate money pool for use by fes, its subsidiaries and fenoc is expected to be established in the first quarter of 2017 at which time those companies will no longer have access to the unregulated companies' money pool.
fes continues to be managed conservatively due to the stress of weak power prices, insufficient proceeds from recent capacity auctions and anemic demand forecasts that have lowered the value of the business. furthermore, the credit quality of fes, specifically its unsecured debt rating of caa1 at moody's, ccc+ at s&p and c at fitch and negative outlook from each of the rating agencies has challenged its ability to hedge generation with retail and forward wholesale sales without collateral obligations, which reduce the business units available liquidity. although fes has access to a $500 million credit facility with fe, which it expects to use in lieu of borrowing under the unregulated companies' money pool, all of which is available as of january 31, 2017, these conditions are a significant challenge to fes.  furthermore, lack of viable alternative strategies for its competitive portfolio would further stress the liquidity and financial condition of fes.
cash flows from operating activities fes' most significant sources of cash are derived from electric service provided by the sales of energy and related products and services. the most significant use of cash from operating activities is to buy electricity in the wholesale market and pay fuel suppliers, employees, tax authorities, lenders, and others for a wide range of material and services.
net cash provided from operating activities was $785 million during 2016, $1,151 million during 2015 and $571 million during 2014. cash flows from operations decreased $366 million in 2016 compared with 2015 due to a $138 million pension trust contribution in 2016 and increased cash collateral postings primarily associated with higher margin requirements by counterparties due to fes' credit rating downgrades in 2016; partially offset by increased capacity revenues, as discussed above in "results of operations".
cash flows from financing activities in 2016, cash provided from financing activities was $57 million, compared to cash used for financing activities of $272 million in 2015, and cash provided from financing activities of $246 million in 2014. the following table summarizes new debt financing (net of any discounts), redemptions and common stock dividend payments:

cash used for investing activity in 2016 decreased $37 million, compared to the same period of 2015, primarily due to lower property additions, partially offset by an increase in nuclear fuel purchases. property additions decreased due to the purchase of the non-affiliated leasehold interest in perry unit 1 during 2015. the increase in nuclear fuel was due to the scheduled davis-besse refueling and maintenance outage in 2016.
market risk information fes uses various market risk sensitive instruments, including derivative contracts, primarily to manage the risk of price and interest rate fluctuations. firstenergy's risk policy committee, comprised of members of senior management, provides general oversight for risk management activities throughout the company.
commodity price risk fes is exposed to financial risks resulting from fluctuating commodity prices, including prices for electricity, natural gas, coal and energy transmission. firstenergy's risk management committee is responsible for promoting the effective design and implementation of sound risk management programs and oversees compliance with corporate risk management policies and established risk management practice. fes uses a variety of derivative instruments for risk management purposes including forward contracts, options, futures contracts and swaps.

item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" as well as note 4 "impairments and losses on divestitures" and note 8 "goodwill" to our consolidated financial statements, discuss the impacts of the current commodity price environment on the energy industry, including our customers and us. refer to the developments addressed in these sections, including the resulting non-cash impairment charges related to goodwill, certain long-lived assets and equity method investments. for a more general discussion of these related risk factors, refer to item 1a. "risk factors."
2017 outlook we expect to declare dividends of $0.50 per share for 2017 and generate approximately $4.46 billion of distributable cash flow. we also expect to invest $3.2 billion on expansion projects during 2017 to be funded with internally generated cash flow without the need to access equity markets. our 2017 budget assumes a joint venture partner on our trans mountain expansion project and contributions from that partner to fund its share of expansion capital, but does not include any potential proceeds in excess of the partner's share of expansion capital to recognize the value created in developing the project to this stage. we are unable to provide budgeted net income attributable to common stockholders (the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow) due to the inherent difficulty and impracticality of predicting certain amounts required by gaap, such as ineffectiveness on commodity, interest rate and foreign currency hedges, unrealized gains and losses on derivatives marked to market, and potential changes in estimates for certain contingent liabilities.
these expectations assume an average 2017 wti crude oil price of $53 per barrel and an average 2017 henry hub natural gas price of $3 per mmbtu, which were consistent with the current forward curve at the time that our 2017 budget was prepared.
the overwhelming majority of cash we generate is supported by multi-year fee-based customer arrangements and therefore is not directly exposed to commodity prices. the primary area where we have direct commodity price sensitivity is in our co2 segment, where we hedge the majority of the next 12 months of oil production to minimize this sensitivity. for 2017, we estimate that every $1 change in the average wti crude oil price per barrel would impact our distributable cash flow by approximately $6 million and each $0.10 per mmbtu change in the average price of natural gas would impact distributable cash flow by approximately $1 million.
in addition, our expectations for 2017 discussed above involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and are not guarantees of performance. many of the factors that will determine these expectations are beyond our ability to control or predict, and because of these uncertainties, it is advisable to not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statement.  please read our item 1a "risk factors" below for more information.  furthermore, we plan to provide updates to our 2017 expectations when we believe previously disclosed expectations no longer have a reasonable basis.

(b) financial information about segments for financial information on our five reportable business segments, see note 16 "reportable segments" to our consolidated financial statements.
(c) narrative description of business business strategy our business strategy is to:
•   focus on stable, fee-based energy transportation and storage assets that are central to the energy infrastructure of growing markets within north america;
•   increase utilization of our existing assets while controlling costs, operating safely, and employing environmentally sound operating practices;
•   leverage economies of scale from incremental acquisitions and expansions of assets that fit within our strategy and are accretive to cash flow; and
•   maintain a strong balance sheet and return value to our stockholders.
it is our intention to carry out the above business strategy, modified as necessary to reflect changing economic conditions and other circumstances. however, as discussed under item 1a. "risk factors" below, there are factors that could affect our ability to carry out our strategy or affect its level of success even if carried out.
we regularly consider and enter into discussions regarding potential acquisitions, and full and partial divestitures, and we are currently contemplating potential transactions. any such transaction would be subject to negotiation of mutually agreeable terms and conditions, receipt of fairness opinions, and approval of our board of directors, if applicable. while there are currently no unannounced purchase or sale agreements for the acquisition or sale of any material business or assets, such transactions can be effected quickly, may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to our existing assets or operations.
business segments we operate the following reportable business segments. these segments and their principal sources of revenues are as follows:
•   natural gas pipelines-the ownership and operation of (i) major interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline and storage systems; (ii) natural gas and crude oil gathering systems and natural gas processing and treating facilities; (iii) ngl fractionation facilities and transportation systems; and (iv) lng facilities;
•   co2-(i) the production, transportation and marketing of co2 to oil fields that use co2 as a flooding medium for recovering crude oil from mature oil fields to increase production; (ii) ownership interests in and/or operation of oil fields and gas processing plants in west texas; and (iii) the ownership and operation of a crude oil pipeline system in west texas;
•   terminals-the ownership and/or operation of (i) liquids and bulk terminal facilities located throughout the u.s. and portions of canada that transload and store refined petroleum products, crude oil, chemicals, and ethanol and bulk products, including coal, petroleum coke, fertilizer, steel and ores and (ii) jones act tankers;
•   products pipelines-the ownership and operation of refined petroleum products, ngl and crude oil and condensate pipelines that primarily deliver, among other products, gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, propane, crude oil and condensate to various markets, plus the ownership and/or operation of associated product terminals and petroleum pipeline transmix facilities; and
•   kinder morgan canada-the ownership and operation of the trans mountain pipeline system that transports crude oil and refined petroleum products from edmonton, alberta, canada to marketing terminals and refineries in british columbia, canada and the state of washington, plus the jet fuel aviation turbine fuel pipeline that serves the vancouver (canada) international airport.
natural gas pipelines our natural gas pipelines segment includes interstate and intrastate pipelines and our lng terminals, and includes both ferc regulated and non-ferc regulated assets.

our primary businesses in this segment consist of natural gas sales, transportation, storage, gathering, processing and treating, and the terminaling of lng. within this segment, are: (i) approximately 46,000 miles of natural gas pipelines and (ii) our equity interests in entities that have approximately 26,000 miles of natural gas pipelines, along with associated storage and supply lines for these transportation networks, which are strategically located throughout the north american natural gas pipeline grid. our transportation network provides access to the major natural gas supply areas and consumers in the western u.s., louisiana, texas, the midwest, northeast, rocky mountain, midwest and southeastern regions. our lng storage and regasification terminals also serve natural gas supply areas in the southeast. the following tables summarize our significant natural gas pipelines segment assets, as of december 31, 2016. the design capacity represents either transmission, gathering or liquefaction capacity depending on the nature of the asset.

competition the market for supply of natural gas is highly competitive, and new pipelines, storage facilities, treating facilities, and facilities for related services are currently being built to serve the growing demand for natural gas in each of the markets served by the pipelines in our natural gas pipelines business segment. our operations compete with interstate and intrastate pipelines, and their shippers, for connections to new markets and supplies and for transportation, processing and treating services. we believe the principal elements of competition in our various markets are location, rates, terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service. from time to time, other projects are proposed that would compete with us. we do not know whether or when any such projects would be built, or the extent of their impact on our operations or profitability.
shippers on our natural gas pipelines compete with other forms of energy available to their natural gas customers and end users, including electricity, coal, propane, fuel oils and renewables such as wind and solar. several factors influence the demand for natural gas, including price changes, the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy, the level of business activity, conservation, legislation and governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels and weather.
co2
our co2 business segment produces, transports, and markets co2 for use in enhanced oil recovery projects as a flooding medium for recovering crude oil from mature oil fields.  our co2 pipelines and related assets allow us to market a complete package of co2 supply, transportation and technical expertise to our customers. we also hold ownership interests in several oil-producing fields and own a crude oil pipeline, all located in the permian basin region of west texas.
sales and transportation activities our principal market for co2 is for injection into mature oil fields in the permian basin, where industry demand is expected to remain stable for the next several years. our ownership of co2 resources as of december 31, 2016 includes:

_______
(a)   the terminals provide services including short-term product storage, truck loading, vapor handling, additive injection, dye injection and ethanol blending.
(b)   our west coast products pipelines assets include interstate common carrier pipelines rate-regulated by the ferc, intrastate pipelines in the state of california rate-regulated by the cpuc, and certain non rate-regulated operations and terminal facilities.
competition our products pipelines' pipeline operations compete against proprietary pipelines owned and operated by major oil companies, other independent products pipelines, trucking and marine transportation firms (for short-haul movements of products) and railcars. our products pipelines' terminal operations compete with proprietary terminals owned and operated by major oil companies and other independent terminal operators, and our transmix operations compete with refineries owned by major oil companies and independent transmix facilities.
kinder morgan canada our kinder morgan canada business segment includes our 100% owned and operated trans mountain pipeline system and a 25-mile jet fuel pipeline system.
trans mountain pipeline system the trans mountain pipeline system originates at edmonton, alberta and transports crude oil and refined petroleum products to destinations in the interior and on the west coast of british columbia. the trans mountain pipeline is 713 miles in length. we also own and operate a connecting pipeline that delivers crude oil to refineries in the state of washington. the
15
capacity of the line at edmonton ranges from 300 mbbl/d when heavy crude oil represents 20% of the total throughput (which is a historically normal heavy crude oil percentage), to 400 mbbl/d with no heavy crude oil.
jet fuel pipeline system we also own and operate the approximate 25-mile aviation fuel pipeline that serves the vancouver international airport, located in vancouver, british columbia, canada. the turbine fuel pipeline is referred to in this report as the jet fuel pipeline system. in addition to its receiving and storage facilities located at the westridge marine terminal, located in port metro vancouver, the jet fuel pipeline system's operations include a terminal at the vancouver airport that consists of five jet fuel storage tanks with an overall capacity of 15 mbbl.
competition trans mountain is one of several pipeline alternatives for western canadian crude oil and refined petroleum production, and it competes against other pipeline providers; however, it is the sole pipeline carrying crude oil and refined petroleum products from alberta to the west coast.  furthermore, as demonstrated by our previously announced expansion proposal, discussed above in "-(a) general development of business-recent developments-kinder morgan canada," we believe that the trans mountain pipeline facilities provide us the opportunity to execute on capacity expansions to the west coast as the market for offshore exports continues to develop.
in december 2013, the british columbia ministry of environment granted approval for a new, airport fuel consortium owned, jet fuel terminal to be located near the vancouver international airport. the impact of this facility on our existing jet fuel pipeline system is uncertain at this time.
major customers our revenue is derived from a wide customer base. for each of the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, no revenues from transactions with a single external customer accounted for 10% or more of our total consolidated revenues. our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline operations (includes the operations of kinder morgan tejas pipeline llc, kinder morgan border pipeline llc, kinder morgan texas pipeline llc, kinder morgan north texas pipeline llc and the mier-monterrey mexico pipeline system) buys and sells significant volumes of natural gas within the state of texas, and, to a far lesser extent, the co2 business segment also sells natural gas. combined, total revenues from the sales of natural gas from the natural gas pipelines and co2 business segments in 2016, 2015 and 2014 accounted for 19%, 20% and 25%, respectively, of our total consolidated revenues. to the extent possible, we attempt to balance the pricing and timing of our natural gas purchases to our natural gas sales, and these contracts are often settled in terms of an index price for both purchases and sales. we do not believe that a loss of revenues from any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
regulation interstate common carrier refined petroleum products and oil pipeline rate regulation - u.s. operations some of our u.s. refined petroleum products and crude oil gathering and transmission pipelines are interstate common carrier pipelines, subject to regulation by the ferc under the interstate commerce act, or ica. the ica requires that we maintain our tariffs on file with the ferc. those tariffs set forth the rates we charge for providing gathering or transportation services on our interstate common carrier pipelines as well as the rules and regulations governing these services. the ica requires, among other things, that such rates on interstate common carrier pipelines be "just and reasonable" and nondiscriminatory. the ica permits interested persons to challenge newly proposed or changed rates and authorizes the ferc to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for a period of up to seven months and to investigate such rates. if, upon completion of an investigation, the ferc finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful, it is authorized to require the carrier to refund the revenues in excess of the prior tariff collected during the pendency of the investigation. the ferc also may investigate, upon complaint or on its own motion, rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively. upon an appropriate showing, a shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained during the two years prior to the filing of a complaint.
the energy policy act of 1992 deemed petroleum products pipeline tariff rates that were in effect for the 365-day period ending on the date of enactment or that were in effect on the 365th day preceding enactment and had not been subject to complaint, protest or investigation during the 365-day period to be just and reasonable or "grandfathered" under the ica. the energy policy act also limited the circumstances under which a complaint can be made against such grandfathered rates.
16
certain rates on our pacific operations' pipeline system were subject to protest during the 365-day period established by the energy policy act. accordingly, certain of the pacific pipelines' rates have been, and continue to be, the subject of complaints with the ferc, as is more fully described in note 17 "litigation, environmental and other contingencies" to our consolidated financial statements.
petroleum products pipelines may change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index. shippers may protest rate increases made within the ceiling levels, but such protests must show that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline's increase in costs from the previous year. a pipeline must, as a general rule, utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates. cost-of-service ratemaking, market-based rates and settlement rates are alternatives to the indexing approach and may be used in certain specified circumstances to change rates.
common carrier pipeline rate regulation - canadian operations the canadian portion of our crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline systems is under the regulatory jurisdiction of the neb. the national energy board act gives the neb power to authorize pipeline construction and to establish tolls and conditions of service. our subsidiary trans mountain pipeline, l.p. is the sole owner of our trans mountain crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline system.
the toll charged for the portion of trans mountain's pipeline system located in the u.s. falls under the jurisdiction of the ferc. for further information, see "-interstate common carrier refined petroleum products and oil pipeline rate regulation - u.s. operations" above.
interstate natural gas transportation and storage regulation posted tariff rates set the general range of maximum and minimum rates we charge shippers on our interstate natural gas pipelines. within that range, each pipeline is permitted to charge discounted rates, so long as such discounts are offered to all similarly situated shippers and granted without undue discrimination. apart from discounted rates offered within the range of tariff maximums and minimums, the pipeline is permitted to charge negotiated rates where the pipeline and shippers want rate certainty, irrespective of changes that may occur to the range of tariff-based maximum and minimum rate levels. negotiated rates provide certainty to the pipeline and the shipper of agreed upon rates during the term of the transportation agreement, regardless of changes to the posted tariff rates. there are a variety of rates that different shippers may pay, but while the rates may vary by shipper and circumstance, pipelines must generally use the form of service agreement that is contained within their ferc approved tariff. any deviation from the pro forma service agreements must be filed with the ferc and only certain types of deviations are acceptable to the ferc.
the ferc regulates the rates, terms and conditions of service, construction and abandonment of facilities by companies performing interstate natural gas transportation services, including storage services, under the natural gas act of 1938. to a lesser extent, the ferc regulates interstate transportation rates, terms and conditions of service under the natural gas policy act of 1978. beginning in the mid-1980's, the ferc initiated a number of regulatory changes intended to ensure that interstate natural gas pipelines operated on a not unduly discriminatory basis and to create a more competitive and transparent environment in the natural gas marketplace. among the most important of these changes were:
•   order no. 436 (1985) which required open-access, nondiscriminatory transportation of natural gas;
•   order no. 497 (1988) which set forth new standards and guidelines imposing certain constraints on the interaction between interstate natural gas pipelines and their marketing affiliates and imposing certain disclosure requirements regarding that interaction;
•   order nos. 587, et seq., order no. 809 (1996-2015) which adopt regulations to standardize the business practices and communication methodologies of interstate natural gas pipelines to create a more integrated and efficient pipeline grid and wherein the ferc has incorporated by reference in its regulations standards for interstate natural gas pipeline business practices and electronic communications that were developed and adopted by the north american energy standards board (naesb). interstate natural gas pipelines are required to incorporate by reference or verbatim in their respective tariffs the applicable version of the naesb standards;
•   order no. 636 (1992) which required interstate natural gas pipelines that perform open-access transportation under blanket certificates to "unbundle" or separate their traditional merchant sales services from their transportation and storage services and to provide comparable transportation and storage services with respect to all natural gas supplies. natural gas pipelines must now separately state the applicable rates for each unbundled service they provide (i.e., for the natural gas commodity, transportation and storage);
17
•   order no. 637 (2000) which revised, among other things, ferc regulations relating to scheduling procedures, capacity segmentation, and pipeline penalties in order to improve the competitiveness and efficiency of the interstate pipeline grid; and
•   order no. 717 (2008) amending the standards of conduct for transmission providers (the standards of conduct or the standards) to make them clearer and to refocus the marketing affiliate rules on the areas where there is the greatest potential for abuse. the ferc standards of conduct address and clarify multiple issues with respect to the actions and operations of interstate natural gas pipelines and public utilities using a functional approach to ensure that natural gas transmission is provided on a nondiscriminatory basis, including (i) the definition of transmission function and transmission function employees; (ii) the definition of marketing function and marketing function employees; (iii) the definition of transmission function information and non-disclosure requirements regarding non-public information; (iv) independent functioning and no conduit requirements; (v) transparency requirements; and (vi) the interaction of ferc standards with the naesb business practice standards. the standards of conduct rules also require that a transmission provider provide annual training on the standards of conduct to all transmission function employees, marketing function employees, officers, directors, supervisory employees, and any other employees likely to become privy to transmission function information.
in addition to regulatory changes initiated by the ferc, the u.s. congress passed the energy policy act of 2005. among other things, the energy policy act amended the natural gas act to: (i) prohibit market manipulation by any entity; (ii) direct the ferc to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce; and (iii) significantly increase the penalties for violations of the natural gas act, the natural gas policy act of 1978, or ferc rules, regulations or orders thereunder.
cpuc rate regulation the intrastate common carrier operations of our pacific operations' pipelines in california are subject to regulation by the cpuc under a "depreciated book plant" methodology, which is based on an original cost measure of investment. intrastate tariffs filed by us with the cpuc have been established on the basis of revenues, expenses and investments allocated as applicable to the california intrastate portion of the pacific operations' business. tariff rates with respect to intrastate pipeline service in california are subject to challenge by complaint by interested parties or by independent action of the cpuc. a variety of factors can affect the rates of return permitted by the cpuc, and certain other issues similar to those which have arisen with respect to our ferc regulated rates also could arise with respect to its intrastate rates. the intrastate rates for movements in california on our sfpp and calnev systems have been, and may in the future be, subject to complaints before the cpuc, as is more fully described in note 17 "litigation, environmental and other contingencies" to our consolidated financial statements.
railroad commission of texas (rct) rate regulation the intrastate operations of our crude oil and liquids pipelines and natural gas pipelines and storage facilities in texas are subject to regulation with respect to such intrastate transportation by the rct. the rct has the authority to regulate our rates, though it generally has not investigated the rates or practices of our intrastate pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints.
mexico - energy regulatory commission the mier-monterrey pipeline has a natural gas transportation permit granted by the energy regulatory commission (the commission) that defines the conditions for the pipeline to carry out activity and provide natural gas transportation service. this permit expires in 2026.
this permit establishes certain restrictive conditions, including without limitations (i) compliance with the general conditions for the provision of natural gas transportation service; (ii) compliance with certain safety measures, contingency plans, maintenance plans and the official mexican standards regarding safety; (iii) compliance with the technical and economic specifications of the natural gas transportation system authorized by the commission; (iv) compliance with certain technical studies established by the commission; and (v) compliance with a minimum contributed capital not entitled to withdrawal of at least the equivalent of 10% of the investment proposed in the project.
mexico - nacional agency for industrial safety and environmental protection (asea)
asea regulates environmental compliance and industrial and operational safety. the mier-monterrey pipeline must satisfy and maintain asea's requirements, including compliance with certain safety measures, contingency plans, maintenance plans and the official mexican standards regarding safety, including a safety administration program.
18
safety regulation we are also subject to safety regulations imposed by phmsa, including those requiring us to develop and maintain pipeline integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate areas along our pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in what are referred to as high consequence areas, or hcas, where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm.
the ultimate costs of compliance with pipeline integrity management rules are difficult to predict. changes such as advances of in-line inspection tools, identification of additional integrity threats and changes to the amount of pipe determined to be located in hcas can have a significant impact on costs to perform integrity testing and repairs. we plan to continue our pipeline integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by phmsa regulations. these tests could result in significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines.
the protecting our infrastructure of pipelines and enhancing safety act of 2016 or "pipes act of 2016" requires phmsa, among others, to set minimum safety standards for underground natural gas storage facilities and allows states to go above those standards for intrastate pipelines. the act also authorizes emergency order authority that is tailored to the pipeline sector, taking into account public health and safety, network, and customer impacts. the financial impact of these two requirements, if any, is unknown at this time.
the pipeline safety, regulatory certainty, and job creation act of 2011, which was signed into law in 2012, increased penalties for violations of safety laws and rules and may result in the imposition of more stringent regulations in the next few years. in 2012, phmsa issued an advisory bulletin which, among other things, advises pipeline operators that if they are relying on design, construction, inspection, testing, or other data to determine maximum pressures at which their pipelines should operate, the records of that data must be traceable, verifiable and complete. locating such records and, in the absence of any such records, verifying maximum pressures through physical testing or modifying or replacing facilities to meet the advisory bulletin requirements, could significantly increase our costs. additionally, failure to locate such records to verify maximum pressures could result in reductions of allowable operating pressures, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines. there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity management regulation, and actual expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. regulations, changes to regulations or an increase in public expectations for pipeline safety may require additional reporting, the replacement of some of our pipeline segments, addition of monitoring equipment and more frequent inspection or testing of our pipeline facilities. repair, remediation, and preventative or mitigating actions may require significant capital and operating expenditures.
from time to time, our pipelines may experience leaks and ruptures. these leaks and ruptures may cause explosions, fire, damage to the environment, damage to property and/or personal injury or death. in connection with these incidents, we may be sued for damages caused by an alleged failure to properly mark the locations of our pipelines and/or to properly maintain our pipelines. depending upon the facts and circumstances of a particular incident, state and federal regulatory authorities may seek civil and/or criminal fines and penalties.
we are also subject to the requirements of the occupational safety and health administration (osha) and other federal and state agencies that address employee health and safety.  in general, we believe current expenditures are addressing the osha requirements and protecting the health and safety of our employees.  based on new regulatory developments, we may increase expenditures in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards.  however, such increases in our expenditures, and the extent to which they might be offset, cannot be estimated at this time.
state and local regulation our activities are subject to various state and local laws and regulations, as well as orders of regulatory bodies, governing a wide variety of matters, including marketing, production, pricing, pollution, protection of the environment, and human health and safety.
marine operations the operation of tankers and marine equipment create maritime obligations involving property, personnel and cargo under general maritime law. these obligations create a variety of risks including, among other things, the risk of collision, which may precipitate claims for personal injury, cargo, contract, pollution, third party claims and property damages to vessels and facilities.
19
we are subject to the jones act and other federal laws that restrict maritime transportation (between u.s. departure and destination points) to vessels built and registered in the u.s. and owned and manned by u.s. citizens. as a result, we monitor the foreign ownership of our common stock and under certain circumstances, consistent with our certificate of incorporation, we have the right to redeem shares of our common stock owned by non-u.s. citizens. if we do not comply with such requirements, we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in u.s. coastwise trade, and under certain circumstances we would be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved foreign transfer, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of u.s. coastwise trading rights for our vessels, fines or forfeiture of the vessels. furthermore, from time to time, legislation has been introduced unsuccessfully in congress to amend the jones act to ease or remove the requirement that vessels operating between u.s. ports be built and registered in the u.s. and owned and manned by u.s. citizens.  if the jones act were amended in such fashion, we could face competition from foreign flagged vessels.
in addition, the u.s. coast guard and the american bureau of shipping maintain the most stringent regime of vessel inspection in the world, which tends to result in higher regulatory compliance costs for u.s.-flag operators than for owners of vessels registered under foreign flags of convenience. the jones act and general maritime law also provide damage remedies for crew members injured in the service of the vessel arising from employer negligence or vessel unseaworthiness.
the merchant marine act of 1936 is a federal law that provides, upon proclamation by the u.s. president of a national emergency or a threat to the national security, the u.s. secretary of transportation the authority to requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by u.s. citizens (including us, provided that we are considered a u.s. citizen for this purpose). if one of our vessels were purchased or requisitioned by the u.s. government under this law, we would be entitled to be paid the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or, in the case of a requisition, the fair market value of charter hire. however, we would not be entitled to compensation for any consequential damages suffered as a result of such purchase or requisition.
environmental matters our business operations are subject to federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, pollution and human health and safety in the u.s. and canada. for example, if an accidental leak, release or spill of liquid petroleum products, chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines, or at or from our storage or other facilities, we may experience significant operational disruptions, and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up the leak, release or spill, pay for government penalties, address natural resource damages, compensate for human exposure or property damage, install costly pollution control equipment or a combination of these and other measures. furthermore, new projects may require approvals and environmental analysis under federal and state laws, including the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act. the resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. in addition, emission controls required under federal, state and provincial environmental laws could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities.
environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations are subject to change. the clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may be perceived to affect the environment, wildlife, natural resources and human health. there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental regulation compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
in accordance with gaap, we accrue liabilities for environmental matters when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. this policy applies to assets or businesses currently owned or previously disposed. we have accrued liabilities for estimable and probable environmental remediation obligations at various sites, including multi-party sites where the epa, or similar state or canadian agency has identified us as one of the potentially responsible parties. the involvement of other financially responsible companies at these multi-party sites could increase or mitigate our actual joint and several liability exposures.
we believe that the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. however, it is possible that our ultimate liability with respect to these environmental matters could exceed the amounts accrued in an amount that could be material to our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period. we have accrued an environmental reserve in the amount of $302 million as of december 31, 2016. our aggregate reserve estimate ranges in value from approximately $302 million to approximately $477 million, and we recorded our liability equal to the low end of the range, as we did not identify
20
any amounts within the range as a better estimate of the liability. for additional information related to environmental matters, see note 17 "litigation, environmental and other contingencies" to our consolidated financial statements.
hazardous and non-hazardous waste we generate both hazardous and non-hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act and comparable state and canadian statutes. from time to time, the epa and state and canadian regulators consider the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non‐hazardous waste. furthermore, it is possible that some wastes that are currently classified as non-hazardous, which could include wastes currently generated during our pipeline or liquids or bulk terminal operations, may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes. hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly handling and disposal requirements than non-hazardous wastes. such changes in the regulations may result in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses for us.
superfund the cercla or the superfund law, and analogous state laws, impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of potentially responsible persons for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. these persons include the owner or operator of a site and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. cercla authorizes the epa and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur, in addition to compensation for natural resource damages, if any. although petroleum is excluded from cercla's definition of a hazardous substance, in the course of our ordinary operations, we have and will generate materials that may fall within the definition of hazardous substance. by operation of law, if we are determined to be a potentially responsible person, we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such materials are present, in addition to compensation for natural resource damages, if any.
clean air act our operations are subject to the clean air act, its implementing regulations, and analogous state and canadian statutes and regulations. the epa regulations under the clean air act contain requirements for the monitoring, reporting, and control of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources. for further information, see "-climate change" below.
clean water act our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants. the federal water pollution control act of 1972, as amended, also known as the clean water act, and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the u.s. the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by applicable federal, state or canadian authorities. the oil pollution act was enacted in 1990 and amends provisions of the clean water act pertaining to prevention and response to oil spills. spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of the clean water act and some state and canadian laws require containment and similar structures to help prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of an overflow or release of oil.
epa revisions to ozone national ambient air quality standard (naaqs)
as required by the clean air act, epa establishes national ambient air quality standards (naaqs) for how much pollution is permissible and then the states have to adopt rules so their air quality meets the naaqs.  in october 2015, epa published a rule lowering the ground level ozone naaqs from 75 ppb to a more stringent 70 ppb standard.  this change triggers a process under which epa will designate the areas of the country that are in or out of attainment with the new naaqs standard.  then, certain states will have to adopt more stringent air quality regulations to meet the naaqs standard.  these new state rules, which are expected in 2020 or 2021, will likely require the installation of more stringent air pollution controls on newly installed equipment and possibly require retrofitting existing kmi facilities with air pollution controls.  given the nationwide implications of the new rule, it is expected that it will have financial impacts for each of our business units.
climate change studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as greenhouse gases, may be contributing to warming of the earth's atmosphere. methane, a primary component of natural gas, and co2, which is naturally occurring and
21
also a byproduct of the burning of natural gas, are examples of greenhouse gases. various laws and regulations exist or are under development that seek to regulate the emission of such greenhouse gases, including the epa programs to control greenhouse gas emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs. the u.s. congress has in the past considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
beginning in december 2009, epa published several findings and rulemakings under the clean air act requiring the permitting and reporting of certain greenhouse gases including co2 and methane. our facilities are subject to these requirements. operational and/or regulatory changes could require additional facilities to comply with greenhouse gas emissions reporting and permitting requirements. additionally, in june 2016, the epa published a proposed rule regarding the "oil and natural gas sector: emission standards for new and modified sources," otherwise known as the proposed new source performance standard (nsps) part ooooa rule. this rule is the first federal rule under the clean air act to regulate methane as a pollutant and would impose additional pollution control and work practice requirements on applicable kmi facilities.
on october 23, 2015, the epa published as a final rule the clean power plan, which sets interim and final co2 emission performance rates for power generating units that fire coal, oil or natural gas. the final rule is the focus of legislative discussion in the u.s. congress and litigation in federal court. on february 10, 2016, the u.s. supreme court stayed the final rule, effectively suspending the duty to comply with the rule until certain legal challenges are resolved.  the ultimate resolution of the final rule's validity remains uncertain.  while we do not operate power plants that would be subject to the clean power plan final rule, it remains unclear what effect the final rule, if it comes into force, might have on the anticipated demand for natural gas, including natural gas that we gather, process, store and transport.
at the state level, more than one-third of the states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas "cap and trade" programs. although many of the state-level initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of greenhouse gas emissions, such as electric power plants, it is possible that sources such as our gas-fired compressors and processing plants could become subject to related state regulations. various states are also proposing or have implemented more strict regulations for greenhouse gases that go beyond the requirements of the epa. depending on the particular program, we could be required to conduct monitoring, do additional emissions reporting and/or purchase and surrender emission allowances.
because our operations, including the compressor stations and processing plants, emit various types of greenhouse gases, primarily methane and co2, such new legislation or regulation could increase the costs related to operating and maintaining the facilities. depending on the particular law, regulation or program, we or our subsidiaries could be required to incur capital expenditures for installing new monitoring equipment of emission controls on the facilities, acquire and surrender allowances for the greenhouse gas emissions, pay taxes related to the greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program. we are not able at this time to estimate such increased costs; however, as is the case with similarly situated entities in the industry, they could be significant to us. while we may be able to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by our or our subsidiaries' pipelines, such recovery of costs in all cases is uncertain and may depend on events beyond their control, including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the ferc or other regulatory bodies, and the provisions of any final legislation or other regulations. any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.
some climatic models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels, increased intensity of hurricanes and tropical storms, and increased frequency of extreme precipitation and flooding. we may experience increased insurance premiums and deductibles, or a decrease in available coverage, for our assets in areas subject to severe weather. to the extent these phenomena occur, they could damage our physical assets, especially operations located in low-lying areas near coasts and river banks, and facilities situated in hurricane-prone regions. however, the timing and location of these climate change impacts is not known with any certainty and, in any event, these impacts are expected to manifest themselves over a long time horizon. thus, we are not in a position to say whether the physical impacts of climate change pose a material risk to our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
because natural gas emits less greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy than competing fossil fuels, cap-and-trade legislation or epa regulatory initiatives such as the proposed clean power plan could stimulate demand for natural gas by increasing the relative cost of fuels such as coal and oil.  in addition, we anticipate that greenhouse gas regulations will increase demand for carbon sequestration technologies, such as the techniques we have successfully demonstrated in our enhanced oil recovery operations within our co2 business segment.  however, these positive effects on our markets may be offset if these same regulations also cause the cost of natural gas to increase relative to competing non-fossil fuels.  although we currently
22
cannot predict the magnitude and direction of these impacts, greenhouse gas regulations could have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
department of homeland security the department of homeland security, referred to in this report as the dhs, has regulatory authority over security at certain high-risk chemical facilities. the dhs has promulgated the chemical facility anti-terrorism standards and required all high-risk chemical and industrial facilities, including oil and gas facilities, to comply with the regulatory requirements of these standards. this process includes completing security vulnerability assessments, developing site security plans, and implementing protective measures necessary to meet dhs-defined, risk based performance standards. the dhs has not provided final notice to all facilities that it determines to be high risk and subject to the rule; therefore, neither the extent to which our facilities may be subject to coverage by the rules nor the associated costs to comply can currently be determined, but it is possible that such costs could be substantial.
other employees we employed 11,121 full-time people at december 31, 2016, including approximately 907 full-time hourly personnel at certain terminals and pipelines covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2017 and 2022. we consider relations with our employees to be good.
most of our employees are employed by us and a limited number of our subsidiaries and provide services to one or more of our business units. the direct costs of compensation, benefits expenses, employer taxes and other employer expenses for these employees are allocated to our subsidiaries. our human resources department provides the administrative support necessary to implement these payroll and benefits services, and the related administrative costs are allocated to our subsidiaries pursuant to our board-approved expense allocation policy. the effect of these arrangements is that each business unit bears the direct compensation and employee benefits costs of its assigned or partially assigned employees, as the case may be, while also bearing its allocable share of administrative costs.
properties we believe that we generally have satisfactory title to the properties we own and use in our businesses, subject to liens for current taxes, liens incident to minor encumbrances, and easements and restrictions, which do not materially detract from the value of such property, the interests in those properties or the use of such properties in our businesses.  our terminals, storage facilities, treating and processing plants, regulator and compressor stations, oil and gas wells, offices and related facilities are located on real property owned or leased by us.  in some cases, the real property we lease is on federal, state, provincial or local government land.
we generally do not own the land on which our pipelines are constructed.  instead, we obtain the right to construct and operate the pipelines on other people's land for a period of time.  substantially all of our pipelines are constructed on rights-of-way granted by the apparent record owners of such property.  in many instances, lands over which rights-of-way have been obtained are subject to prior liens that have not been subordinated to the right-of-way grants.  in some cases, not all of the apparent record owners have joined in the right-of-way grants, but in substantially all such cases, signatures of the owners of a majority of the interests have been obtained.  permits have been obtained from public authorities to cross over or under, or to lay facilities in or along, water courses, county roads, municipal streets and state highways, and in some instances, such permits are revocable at the election of the grantor, or, the pipeline may be required to move its facilities at its own expense.  permits also have been obtained from railroad companies to run along or cross over or under lands or rights-of-way, many of which are also revocable at the grantor's election.  some such permits require annual or other periodic payments.  in a few minor cases, property for pipeline purposes was purchased in fee.

item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.  we prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap. additional sections in this report which should be helpful to the reading of our discussion and analysis include the following: (i) a description of our business strategy found in items 1 and 2 "business and properties-(c) narrative description of business-business strategy;" (ii) a description of developments during 2016, found in items 1 and 2 "business and properties-(a) general development of business-recent developments;" and (iii) a description of risk factors affecting us and our business, found in item 1a "risk factors."
inasmuch as the discussion below and the other sections to which we have referred you pertain to management's comments on financial resources, capital spending, our business strategy and the outlook for our business, such discussions contain forward-looking statements.  these forward-looking statements reflect the expectations, beliefs, plans and objectives of management about future financial performance and assumptions underlying management's judgment concerning the matters discussed, and accordingly, involve estimates, assumptions, judgments and uncertainties.  our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.  factors that could cause or contribute to any differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in item 1a "risk factors" and at the beginning of this report in "information regarding forward-looking statements."
general our business model, through our ownership and operation of energy related assets, is built to support two principal objectives:
•   helping customers by providing safe and reliable natural gas, liquids products and bulk commodity transportation, storage and distribution; and
•   creating long-term value for our shareholders.
to achieve these objectives, we focus on providing fee-based services to customers from a business portfolio consisting of energy-related pipelines, natural gas storage, processing and treating facilities, and bulk and liquids terminal facilities. we also produce and sell crude oil. our reportable business segments are based on the way our management organizes our enterprise, and each of our business segments represents a component of our enterprise that engages in a separate business activity and for which discrete financial information is available.
our reportable business segments are:
•   natural gas pipelines-the ownership and operation of (i) major interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline and storage systems; (ii) natural gas and crude oil gathering systems and natural gas processing and treating facilities; (iii) ngl fractionation facilities and transportation systems; and (iv) lng facilities;
•   co2-(i) the production, transportation and marketing of co2 to oil fields that use co2 as a flooding medium for recovering crude oil from mature oil fields to increase production; (ii) ownership interests in and/or operation of oil fields and gas processing plants in west texas; and (iii) the ownership and operation of a crude oil pipeline system in west texas;
•   terminals-the ownership and/or operation of (i) liquids and bulk terminal facilities located throughout the u.s. and portions of canada that transload and store refined petroleum products, crude oil, chemicals, and ethanol and bulk products, including coal, petroleum coke, fertilizer, steel and ores and (ii) jones act tankers;
•   products pipelines-the ownership and operation of refined petroleum products, ngl and crude oil and condensate pipelines that primarily deliver, among other products, gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, propane, crude oil and condensate to various markets, plus the ownership and/or operation of associated product terminals and petroleum pipeline transmix facilities; and
37
•   kinder morgan canada-the ownership and operation of the trans mountain pipeline system that transports crude oil and refined petroleum products from edmonton, alberta, canada to marketing terminals and refineries in british columbia, canada and the state of washington, plus the jet fuel aviation turbine fuel pipeline that serves the vancouver (canada) international airport.
as an energy infrastructure owner and operator in multiple facets of the various u.s. and canadian energy industries and markets, we examine a number of variables and factors on a routine basis to evaluate our current performance and our prospects for the future.
with respect to our interstate natural gas pipelines, related storage facilities and lng terminals, the revenues from these assets are primarily received under contracts with terms that are fixed for various and extended periods of time.  to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors, we generally attempt to mitigate risk of reduced volumes and prices by negotiating contracts with longer terms, with higher per-unit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity.  these long-term contracts are typically structured with a fixed-fee reserving the right to transport or store natural gas and specify that we receive the majority of our fee for making the capacity available, whether or not the customer actually chooses to utilize the capacity.  similarly, the texas intrastate natural gas pipeline operations, currently derives approximately 77% of its sales and transport margins from long-term transport and sales contracts.  as contracts expire, we have additional exposure to the longer term trends in supply and demand for natural gas.  as of december 31, 2016, the remaining weighted average contract life of our natural gas transportation contracts (including intrastate pipelines' purchase and sales contracts) was approximately six years.
our midstream assets provide gathering and processing services for natural gas and gathering services for crude oil. these assets are generally fee-based and the revenues and earnings we realize from gathering natural gas, processing natural gas in order to remove ngl from the natural gas stream, and fractionating ngl into their base components, are affected by the volumes of natural gas made available to our systems. such volumes are impacted by producer rig count and drilling activity. in addition to fee based arrangements, we also provide some services based on percent-of-proceeds, percent-of-index and keep-whole contracts some of which may include minimum volume requirements. our service contracts may rely solely on a single type of arrangement, but more often they combine elements of two or more of the above, which helps us and our counterparties manage the extent to which each shares in the potential risks and benefits of changing commodity prices.
the co2 source and transportation business primarily has third-party contracts with minimum volume requirements, which as of december 31, 2016, had a remaining average contract life of approximately nine years.  co2 sales contracts vary from customer to customer and have evolved over time as supply and demand conditions have changed.  our recent contracts have generally provided for a delivered price tied to the price of crude oil, but with a floor price.  on a volume-weighted basis, for third-party contracts making deliveries in 2017, and utilizing the average oil price per barrel contained in our 2017 budget, approximately 98% of our revenue is based on a fixed fee or floor price, and 2% fluctuates with the price of oil. in the long-term, our success in this portion of the co2 business segment is driven by the demand for co2. however, short-term changes in the demand for co2 typically do not have a significant impact on us due to the required minimum sales volumes under many of our contracts.  in the co2 business segment's oil and gas producing activities, we monitor the amount of capital we expend in relation to the amount of production that we expect to add.  in that regard, our production during any period is an important measure.  in addition, the revenues we receive from our crude oil, ngl and co2 sales are affected by the prices we realize from the sale of these products.  over the long-term, we will tend to receive prices that are dictated by the demand and overall market price for these products.  in the shorter term, however, market prices are likely not indicative of the revenues we will receive due to our risk management, or hedging, program, in which the prices to be realized for certain of our future sales quantities are fixed, capped or bracketed through the use of financial derivative contracts, particularly for crude oil.  the realized weighted average crude oil price per barrel, with the hedges allocated to oil, was $61.52 per barrel in 2016, $73.11 per barrel in 2015, and $88.41 per barrel in 2014.  had we not used energy derivative contracts to transfer commodity price risk, our crude oil sales prices would have averaged $41.36 per barrel in 2016, $47.56 per barrel in 2015, and $86.48 per barrel in 2014.
the factors impacting our terminals business segment generally differ depending on whether the terminal is a liquids or bulk terminal, and in the case of a bulk terminal, the type of product being handled or stored.  our liquids terminals business generally has longer-term contracts that require the customer to pay regardless of whether they use the capacity.  thus, similar to our natural gas pipeline business, our liquids terminals business is less sensitive to short-term changes in supply and demand.  therefore, the extent to which changes in these variables affect our terminals business in the near term is a function of the length of the underlying service contracts (which on average is approximately four years), the extent to which revenues under the contracts are a function of the amount of product stored or transported, and the extent to which such contracts expire during any given period of time.  as with our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation business, the revenues from our bulk terminals business are generally driven by the volumes we handle and/or store, as well as the prices we receive for our
38
services, which in turn are driven by the demand for the products being shipped or stored.  while we handle and store a large variety of products in our bulk terminals, the primary products are steel, coal and petroleum coke. for the most part, we have contracts for this business that contain minimum volume guarantees and/or service exclusivity arrangements under which customers are required to utilize our terminals for all or a specified percentage of their handling and storage needs.  the profitability of our minimum volume contracts is generally unaffected by short-term variation in economic conditions; however, to the extent we expect volumes above the minimum and/or have contracts which are volume-based we can be sensitive to changing market conditions.  to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors, we generally attempt to mitigate the risk of reduced volumes and pricing by negotiating contracts with longer terms, with higher per-unit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity.  in addition, weather-related factors such as hurricanes, floods and droughts may impact our facilities and access to them and, thus, the profitability of certain terminals for limited periods of time or, in relatively rare cases of severe damage to facilities, for longer periods. in addition to liquid and bulk terminals, we also own jones act tankers. as of december 31, 2016, we have twelve jones act qualified tankers that operate in the marine transportation of crude oil, condensate and refined products in the u.s. and are currently operating pursuant to multi-year predominately fixed price charters with major integrated oil companies, major refiners and the u.s. military sealift command.
the profitability of our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation and storage business is generally driven by the volume of refined petroleum products that we transport and the prices we receive for our services. we also have approximately 55 liquids terminals in this business segment that store fuels and offer blending services for ethanol and biofuels. the transportation and storage volume levels are primarily driven by the demand for the refined petroleum products being shipped or stored.  demand for refined petroleum products tends to track in large measure demographic and economic growth, and with the exception of periods of time with very high product prices or recessionary conditions, demand tends to be relatively stable.  because of that, we seek to own refined petroleum products pipelines located in, or that transport to, stable or growing markets and population centers.  the prices for shipping are generally based on regulated tariffs that are adjusted annually based on changes in the u.s. producer price index.
our crude and condensate transportation services are primarily provided either pursuant to (i) long-term contracts that normally contain minimum volume commitments or (ii) through terms prescribed by the toll settlements with shippers and approved by regulatory authorities. as a result of these contracts, our settlement volumes are generally not sensitive to changing market conditions in the shorter term, however, in the longer term the revenues and earnings we realize from our crude and condensate pipelines in the u.s. and canada are affected by the volumes of crude and condensate available to our pipeline systems, which are impacted by the level of oil and gas drilling activity in the respective producing regions that we serve. our petroleum condensate processing facility splits condensate into its various components, such as light and heavy naphtha, under a long-term fee-based agreement with a major integrated oil company.
a portion of our business portfolio transacts in and/or uses the canadian dollar as the functional currency, which affects segment results due to the variability in u.s. - canadian dollar exchange rates.  our canadian operations are included in three of our business segments: (i) our kinder morgan canada segment, which is comprised of the trans mountain pipeline, an oversubscribed common carrier crude oil and refined petroleum pipeline serving western canada, the trans mountain (puget) pipeline serving washington state; and the jet fuel pipeline serving vancouver international airport; (ii) terminal facilities located in western canada that are included in our terminals business segment; and (iii) the canadian portion of our cochin pipeline, which is included in our products pipelines business segment.
in our discussions of the operating results of individual businesses that follow (see "-results of operations" below), we generally identify the important fluctuations between periods that are attributable to acquisitions and dispositions separately from those that are attributable to businesses owned in both periods.
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting standards require information in financial statements about the risks and uncertainties inherent in significant estimates, and the application of gaap involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment.  certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated, requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time our financial statements are prepared.  these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for our assets and liabilities, our revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements.  we routinely evaluate these estimates, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances.  nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates, and any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.
39
in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, examples of certain areas that require more judgment relative to others include our use of estimates in determining: (i) revenue recognition and income taxes, (ii) the economic useful lives of our assets and related depletion rates; (iii) the fair values used to assign purchase price from business combinations, determine possible asset and equity investment impairment charges, and calculate the annual goodwill impairment test; (iv) reserves for environmental claims, legal fees, transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities; (v) provisions for uncollectible accounts receivables; and (vi) exposures under contractual indemnifications.
for a summary of our significant accounting policies, see note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements.  we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our consolidated financial statement preparation process than others, which policies are discussed as follows.
acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses, we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. determining the fair value of these items requires management's judgment, the utilization of independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, market prices and asset lives, among other items. the judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee, as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability, can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition, such as through depreciation and amortization expense. for more information on our acquisitions and application of the acquisition method, see note 3 "acquisitions and divestitures" to our consolidated financial statements.
environmental matters with respect to our environmental exposure, we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts.  we expense or capitalize, as appropriate, environmental expenditures that relate to current operations, and we record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable and we can reasonably estimate the costs.  generally, we do not discount environmental liabilities to a net present value, and we recognize receivables for anticipated associated insurance recoveries when such recoveries are deemed to be probable. we record at fair value, where appropriate, environmental liabilities assumed in a business combination.
our recording of our environmental accruals often coincides with our completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action, but generally, we recognize and/or adjust our environmental liabilities following routine reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that could impact our assets or operations.  these adjustments may result in increases in environmental expenses and are primarily related to quarterly reviews of potential environmental issues and resulting environmental liability estimates. in making these liability estimations, we consider the effect of environmental compliance, pending legal actions against us, and potential third party liability claims.  for more information on environmental matters, see items 1 and 2 "business and properties-(c) narrative description of business-environmental matters". for more information on our environmental disclosures, see note 17 "litigation, environmental and other contingencies" to our consolidated financial statements.
legal and regulatory matters many of our operations are regulated by various u.s. and canadian regulatory bodies and we are subject to legal and regulatory matters as a result of our business operations and transactions.  we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders, judgments or settlements.  in general, we expense legal costs as incurred.  when we identify contingent liabilities, we identify a range of possible costs expected to be required to resolve the matter.  generally, if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount, we record a liability equal to the low end of the range.  any such liability recorded is revised as better information becomes available. accordingly, to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates, or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates, our earnings will be affected. for more information on legal proceedings, see note 17 "litigation, environmental and other contingencies" to our consolidated financial statements.
40
intangible assets intangible assets are those assets which provide future economic benefit but have no physical substance.  identifiable intangible assets having indefinite useful economic lives, including goodwill, are not subject to regular periodic amortization, and such assets are not to be amortized until their lives are determined to be finite.  instead, the carrying amount of a recognized intangible asset with an indefinite useful life must be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value.  we evaluate goodwill for impairment on may 31 of each year. at year end and during other interim periods we evaluate our reporting units for events and changes that could indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit could be less than its carrying amount.
excluding goodwill, our other intangible assets include customer contracts, relationships and agreements, lease value, and technology-based assets.  these intangible assets have definite lives, are being amortized in a systematic and rational manner over their estimated useful lives, and are reported separately as "other intangibles, net" in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
hedging activities we engage in a hedging program that utilizes derivative contracts to mitigate (offset) our exposure to fluctuations in energy commodity prices, foreign currency exposure on euro denominated debt, and to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates, and we believe that these hedges are generally effective in realizing these objectives.  according to the provisions of gaap, to be considered effective, changes in the value of a derivative contract or its resulting cash flows must substantially offset changes in the value or cash flows of the item being hedged, and any ineffective portion of the hedge gain or loss and any component excluded from the computation of the effectiveness of the derivative contract must be reported in earnings immediately.
all of our derivative contracts are recorded at estimated fair value. we utilize published prices, broker quotes, and estimates of market prices to estimate the fair value of these contracts; however, actual amounts could vary materially from estimated fair values as a result of changes in market prices. in addition, changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations. we do not anticipate future changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these derivative contracts. for more information on our hedging activities, see note 14, "risk management" to our consolidated financial statements.
employee benefit plans we reflect an asset or liability for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on their overfunded or underfunded status. as of december 31, 2016, our pension plans were underfunded by $724 million and our other postretirement benefits plans were underfunded by $141 million. our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net benefit costs are primarily based on actuarial calculations. we use various assumptions in performing these calculations, including those related to the return that we expect to earn on our plan assets, the rate at which we expect the compensation of our employees to increase over the plan term, the estimated cost of health care when benefits are provided under our plan and other factors. a significant assumption we utilize is the discount rate used in calculating our benefit obligations. we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost (credit) for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans which applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows. the selection of these assumptions is further discussed in note 10 "share-based compensation and employee benefits" to our consolidated financial statements.
actual results may differ from the assumptions included in these calculations, and as a result, our estimates associated with our pension and other postretirement benefits can be, and often are, revised in the future. the income statement impact of the changes in the assumptions on our related benefit obligations are deferred and amortized into income over either the period of expected future service of active participants, or over the expected future lives of inactive plan participants. as of december 31, 2016, we had deferred net losses of approximately $613 million in pretax accumulated other comprehensive loss and noncontrolling interests related to our pension and other postretirement benefits.

(a)   includes amounts deferred as either accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) or as a regulatory asset or liability for certain of our regulated operations.
income taxes income tax expense is recorded based on an estimate of the effective tax rate in effect or to be in effect during the relevant periods. changes in tax legislation are included in the relevant computations in the period in which such changes are effective. we do business in a number of states with differing laws concerning how income subject to each state's tax structure is measured and at what effective rate such income is taxed. therefore, we must make estimates of how our income will be apportioned among the various states in order to arrive at an overall effective tax rate. changes in our effective rate, including any effect on previously recorded deferred taxes, are recorded in the period in which the need for such change is identified.
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance for the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. while we have considered estimated future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the amount of our valuation allowance, any change in the amount that we expect to ultimately realize will be included in income in the period in which such a determination is reached.
in determining the deferred income tax asset and liability balances attributable to our investments, we apply an accounting policy that looks through our investments. the application of this policy resulted in no deferred income taxes being provided on the difference between the book and tax basis on the non-tax-deductible goodwill portion of our investments.
results of operations overview our management evaluates our performance primarily using the measures of segment ebda and, as discussed below under "-non-gaap measures," distributable cash flow, or dcf, and segment ebda before certain items. segment ebda is a useful measure of our operating performance because it measures the operating results of our segments before dd&a and certain expenses that are generally not controllable by our business segment operating managers, such as general and administrative expenses, interest expense, net, and income taxes. our general and administrative expenses include such items as employee benefits, insurance, rentals, unallocated litigation and environmental expenses, and shared corporate services including accounting, information technology, human resources and legal services.

segment results for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the elimination of the other segment as a reportable segment. the activities that previously comprised the other segment are now presented within the corporate non-segment activities in reconciling to the consolidated totals in the respective segment reporting tables. the other segment had historically been comprised primarily of legacy operations of acquired businesses not associated with our ongoing operations. these business activities have since been sold or have otherwise ceased. in addition, the other segment included certain company owned real estate assets which are primarily leased to our operating subsidiaries as well as third party tenants. this activity is now reflected within corporate activity. in addition, the portions of interest income and income tax expense previously allocated to our business segments are now included in "interest expense, net" and "income tax expense" for all periods presented in the following tables.

year ended december 31, 2016 vs. 2015
the certain item totals reflected in footnotes (b), (c), (d) and (e) to the table above accounted for $866 million of the increase in income before income taxes in 2016 as compared to 2015 (representing the difference between decreases of $915 million and $1,781 million in income before income taxes for 2016 and 2015, respectively). after giving effect to these certain items, which are discussed in more detail in the discussion that follows, income before income taxes for 2016 when compared to the prior year was flat. increased results in our products pipelines and terminals business segments and decreased dd&a expense and interest expense, net, were offset by unfavorable commodity prices affecting our co2 business segment and decreased results on our natural gas pipelines business segment. the decrease in dd&a was primarily driven by lower dd&a in our co2 business segment and the decrease in interest expense was due to lower weighted average debt balances, partially offset by a slightly higher overall weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt.
year ended december 31, 2015 vs. 2014
the certain item totals reflected in footnotes (b), (c), (d) and (e) to the table above accounted for $1,767 million of the decrease in income before income taxes in 2015 as compared to 2014 (representing the difference between decreases of $1,781 million and $14 million in income before income taxes for 2015 and 2014, respectively). after giving effect to these certain items, which are discussed in more detail in the discussion that follows, the remaining decrease of $552 million (18%) from the prior year in income before income taxes is primarily attributable to increased dd&a expense, general and administrative expense and interest expense, net. as explained further below, our total segment earnings before dd&a did not change significantly when compared to the prior year as unfavorable commodity prices affecting our co2 business segment were offset by increased results from our products pipelines, terminals and natural gas pipelines business segments.
non-gaap financial measures our non-gaap performance measures are dcf, both in the aggregate and per share, and segment ebda before certain items. certain items are items that are required by gaap to be reflected in net income, but typically either (i) do not have a cash impact (for example, asset impairments), or (ii) by their nature are separately identifiable from our normal business operations and in our view are likely to occur only sporadically (for example certain legal settlements, hurricane impacts and casualty losses).
our non-gaap performance measures described below should not be considered alternatives to gaap net income or other gaap measures and have important limitations as analytical tools. our computations of dcf and segment ebda before certain items may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. you should not consider these non-gaap performance measures in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap. dcf should not be used as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities computed under gaap. management compensates for the limitations of these non-gaap performance measures by reviewing our comparable gaap measures, understanding the differences between the measures and taking this information into account in its analysis and its decision making processes.
distributable cash flow dcf is a significant performance measure used by us and by external users of our financial statements to evaluate our performance and to measure and estimate the ability of our assets to generate cash earnings after servicing our debt and preferred stock dividends, paying cash taxes and expending sustaining capital, that could be used for discretionary purposes such as common stock dividends, stock repurchases, retirement of debt, or expansion capital expenditures. management uses this performance measure and believes it provides users of our financial statements a useful performance measure reflective of our business's ability to generate cash earnings to supplement the comparable gaap measure. we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to dcf is net income available to common stockholders. a reconciliation of dcf to net income available to common stockholders is provided in the table below. dcf per share is dcf divided by average outstanding shares, including restricted stock awards that participate in dividends.
segment ebda before certain items segment ebda before certain items is used by management in its analysis of segment performance and management of our business. general and administrative expenses are generally not under the control of our segment operating managers, and therefore, are not included when we measure business segment operating performance. we believe segment ebda before certain items is a significant performance metric because it provides us and external users of our financial statements additional insight into the ability of our segments to generate segment cash earnings on an ongoing basis. we believe it is useful to
44
investors because it is a performance measure that management uses to allocate resources to our segments and assess each segment's performance. we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to segment ebda before certain items is segment earnings before dd&a and amortization of excess cost of equity investments (segment ebda).
in the tables for each of our business segments under "- segment earnings results" below, segment ebda before certain items is calculated by adjusting the segment ebda for the applicable certain item amounts, which are totaled in the tables and described in the footnotes to those tables.

the changes in segment ebda for our natural gas pipelines business segment are further explained by the following discussion of the significant factors driving segment ebda before certain items in the comparable years of 2016 and 2015:
•   decrease of $109 million (25%) from sng primarily due to our sale of a 50% interest in sng to the southern company (southern company) on september 1, 2016;
•   decrease of $62 million (18%) from south texas midstream primarily due to lower volumes and price. revenue decreased approximately $229 million partially offset by a decrease in costs of sales;
•   decrease of $48 million (36%) from kinderhawk due to lower volumes;
•   decrease of $31 million (135%) from kmlp as a result of a customer contract buyout in the fourth quarter of 2015;
•   decrease of $27 million (9%) from cig primarily due to a recent rate case settlement and lower firm reservation revenues due to contract expirations and contract renewals at lower rates;
•   decrease of $22 million (37%) from cpg primarily due to lower transport revenues as a result of contract expirations;
•   decrease of $15 million (48%) from transcolorado primarily due to lower transport revenues as a result of contract expirations;
•   increase of $171 million (18%) from tgp primarily due to a full year of earnings from expansion projects placed in service during 2015 and favorable 2016 firm transport revenues;
•   increase of $59 million (42%) from hiland midstream primarily due to favorable margins on renegotiated contracts, along with results of a full year from our february 2015 hiland acquisition; and
•   increase of $7 million (2%) from our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline operations (including the operations of its kinder morgan tejas, border, kinder morgan texas, north texas and mier-monterrey mexico pipeline systems) primarily due to higher storage margins partially offset by lower sales and transportation margins as a result of lower volumes. the decrease in revenues of $278 million resulted primarily from a decrease in sales revenue due to lower commodity prices which was largely offset by a corresponding decrease in costs of sales.

the changes in segment ebda for our natural gas pipelines business segment are further explained by the following discussion of the significant factors driving segment ebda before certain items in the comparable years of 2015 and 2014:
•   increase of $140 million from our february 2015 acquisition of the hiland midstream asset;
•   increase of $36 million (4%) from tgp primarily due to higher revenues from firm transportation and storage services due largely to expansion projects placed in service in the fourth quarter 2014 and during 2015. partially offsetting this was an increase in the provision for revenue sharing during 2015, lower transportation usage revenues and natural gas park and loan revenues due to milder winter weather in 2015 and higher ad valorem taxes;
•   increase of $35 million (9%) from epng due largely to additional firm transport revenues due, in part, to additional demand from mexico;
•   increase of $31 million (443%) from eaglehawk driven by higher volumes and lower pipeline integrity costs;
•   increase of $15 million (4%) from our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline operations (including the operations of its kinder morgan tejas, border, kinder morgan texas, north texas and mier-monterrey mexico pipeline systems) due largely to higher transportation and natural gas sales margins as a result of new customer contracts, partially offset by lower processing margins due to the non-renewal of a customer contract in the second quarter of 2014 and lower storage margins. the decrease in revenues of $1,231 million and associated decrease in costs of goods sold were caused by lower natural gas prices;
•   decrease of $67 million (34%) from kinderhawk primarily due to the expiration of a minimum volume contract;
•   decrease of $38 million (57%) from oklahoma midstream primarily due to lower commodity prices and lower volumes. lower revenues of $247 million and associated decrease in costs of goods sold were also due to lower commodity prices;
•   decrease of $33 million (59%) from kmlp as a result of a customer contract buyout in the third quarter of 2014;
•   decrease of $24 million (29%) from cpg due primarily to lower transport revenues as a result of contract expirations;
•   decrease of $21 million (35%) from altamont midstream primarily due to lower commodity prices partially offset by higher volumes; and
•   decrease of $9 million (3%) from south texas midstream primarily due to lower commodity prices, partially offset by higher gathering and processing volumes. lower revenues of $417 million and associated decrease in costs of goods sold were due to lower commodity prices.

the changes in segment ebda for our terminals business segment are further explained by the following discussion of the significant factors driving segment ebda before certain items in the comparable years of 2016 and 2015:
•   increase of $52 million (51%) from our marine operations related to the incremental earnings from the december 2015, may 2016, july 2016, september 2016 and december 2016 in-service of the jones act tankers the lone star state, magnolia state, garden state, bay state,and american endurance, respectively, and increased charter rates on the empire state jones act tanker;
•   increase of $14 million (12%) from our alberta, canada terminals, driven by a full year of earnings from our edmonton south rail terminal joint venture expansion, which began operations in second quarter 2015;
•   increase of $14 million (6%) from our gulf liquids terminals, primarily related to higher volumes as a result of various expansion projects, including marine infrastructure improvements at our galena park and north docks terminals, as well as higher rates and ancillary service activities on existing business;
•   increase of $11 million (10%) from our northeast terminals, primarily due to contributions from two terminals acquired as part of the bp products north america inc. acquisition which was completed in february 2016;
•   increase of $4 million (7%) from our lower river terminals, due to a $15 million write-off of certain coal customers accounts receivable which occurred in 2015 and favorable results from certain lower river terminals, partially offset by decreased revenues and earnings of $18 million due to certain coal customer bankruptcies;
•   decrease of $13 million (17%) from our gulf bulk terminals, driven by decreased revenues and earnings of $41 million due to certain coal customer bankruptcies offset by a $28 million write-off of a certain coal customer's accounts receivable which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2015;
•   decrease of $2 million (67%) from our sale of certain bulk and transload terminal facilities to watco companies, llc in early 2015; and
•   included in "all others" is a decrease in revenues and earnings of $11 million due to certain coal customer bankruptcies as compared to a $4 million write-off of certain coal customers accounts receivable which occurred in 2015.

n/a - not applicable the changes in segment ebda for our terminals business segment are further explained by the following discussion of the significant factors driving segment ebda before certain items in the comparable years of 2015 and 2014:
•   increase of $52 million (76%) from our alberta, canada terminals, driven by our edmonton-area expansion projects, including storage and connectivity additions at our edmonton south and north 40 terminals as well as the commissioning of two joint venture rail terminals;
•   increase of $44 million from our marine operations related primarily to the incremental earnings from the jones act tankers we acquired in the first and fourth quarters of 2014 as well as the december 2015 delivery from the nassco shipyard of the first new build tanker, the lone star state;
•   increase of $24 million (11%) from our gulf liquids terminals, related to the vopak terminal acquisition completed in first quarter 2015 and the addition of nine new tanks at galena park placed into service during fourth quarter 2014 and first quarter 2015;
•   increase of $23 million (52%) from our gulf central terminals, driven by higher earnings from our expansion projects at our joint venture terminals, battleground oil specialty terminal company llc (bostco) and deeprock development llc;
•   decrease of $17 million (77%) from our sale of certain bulk and transload terminal facilities to watco companies, llc in early 2015;
•   decrease of $16 million (18%) from our gulf bulk terminals, primarily from reduced coal earnings due to certain coal customers bankruptcies of $27 million partially offset by increased shortfall revenue from take-or-pay coal contracts;
•   decrease of $21 million (29%) from our mid atlantic terminals, driven by lower revenues as a result of lower tonnage partially offset by higher shortfall revenue from take-or-pay coal contracts; and
•   decrease of $21 million primarily from reduced coal earnings due to certain coal customers bankruptcies, which impacted our international marine terminals and mid river terminals included in "all others" and the mid atlantic terminals noted above by $16 million, $3 million and $2 million, respectively.

the changes in segment ebda for our products pipelines business segment are further explained by the following discussion of the significant factors driving segment ebda before certain items in the comparable years of 2016 and 2015:
•   increase of $37 million (20%) from kinder morgan crude &amp; condensate pipeline driven primarily by an increase in pipeline throughput volumes from existing customers and additional volumes associated with expansion projects;
•   increase of $20 million (53%) from our kmcc - splitter due to first and second phases being in full operation for 2016. start up of first phase was in march 2015 and second phase was in july 2015;
•   increase of $15 million (34%) due to full year of results from our double h pipeline, which began operations in march 2015;
•   increase of $9 million (17%) from our equity investment in plantation pipe line primarily due to lower operating costs;
•   increase of $8 million (26%) from our transmix processing operations largely due to unfavorable market price impacts during the fourth quarter of 2015. the decrease in revenues of $286 million and associated decrease in costs of goods sold were driven by lower sales volumes primarily due to the sale of our indianola plant in august 2016; and
•   decrease of $13 million (11%) from cochin primarily due to higher pipeline integrity costs.

the changes in segment ebda for our products pipelines business segment are further explained by the following discussion of the significant factors driving segment ebda before certain items in the comparable years of 2015 and 2014:
•   increase of $102 million (124%) from kinder morgan crude &amp; condensate pipeline driven primarily by an increase of pipeline throughput volumes due to the ramp up of existing customer volumes and additional volumes from new customers;
•   increase of $33 million from our kmcc - splitter due to the startup of the first and second phases in march 2015 and july 2015;
•   increase of $44 million from our double h pipeline which was acquired in february 2015 as part of the hiland acquisition;
•   increase of $35 million (40%) from cochin driven by higher service revenues due to the completion of the cochin reversal project in the third quarter of 2014;
•   increase of $23 million (7%) from our pacific operations due to higher service revenues, resulting from higher volumes and margins; and
•   increase of $8 million (33%) from our transmix processing operations primarily due to favorable inventory adjustments impacting margins. the decrease in revenues of $490 million and associated decrease in costs of goods sold were caused by lower commodity prices.

_______
certain items
(a)   2016 amount includes increases in expense of (i) $14 million related to severance costs; and (ii) $12 million related to acquisition costs; offset by a decrease in expense of $31 million related to certain corporate litigation matters. 2015 and 2014 amounts include decreases in expense of $35 million and $39 million related to pension credit income. 2015 amount also includes increases in expense of $45 million related to certain corporate legal matters and $15 million related to costs associated with acquisitions. 2014 amount also includes a net increase of $11 million in expense for various other certain items.
(b)   2016, 2015 and 2014 amounts include (i) decreases in interest expense of $115 million, $71 million and $65 million, respectively, related to non-cash debt fair value adjustments associated with acquisitions; (ii) a $34 million decrease, a $21 million increase and a $15 million increase, respectively, in interest expense related to certain litigation matters; and (iii) a $44 million decrease, a $23 million increase and
57
a $1 million decrease, respectively, in interest expense primarily related to non-cash true-ups of our estimates of swap ineffectiveness. 2014 amount also includes (i) increases in expense of $9 million of amortization of capitalized financing fees; (ii) $12 million of interest expense on margin for marketing contracts associated with legacy operations; and (iii) $27 million of interest expense related to the merger transactions.
(c)   2015 amount is primarily related to a litigation matter and 2014 amount is primarily related to our foreign operations.
(d)   2015 amount reflects the noncontrolling interest portion of certain items including (i) a $43 million impairment and a $6 million loss associated with terminals segment certain items and disclosed above in "-terminals" and (ii) a $14 million loss associated with a natural gas pipelines segment impairment certain item and disclosed above in "-natural gas pipelines."
other
(e)   2016, 2015 and 2014 amounts include certain equity investee management fee revenue of $34 million, $37 million and $36 million, respectively. these amounts are recorded to the "product sales and other" caption with the offsetting expenses primarily included in the "general and administrative" expense caption in our accompanying consolidated statements of income.
general and administrative expenses before certain items increased $12 million in 2016 and $26 million in 2015 when compared with the respective prior year. the increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily driven by higher benefit costs and lower capitalized costs partially offset by lower labor, outside services and insurance costs. the increase in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily driven by the acquisition of hiland (effective february 13, 2015), lower capitalized costs and higher labor expenses partially offset by lower benefit and insurance costs.
in the table above, we report our interest expense as "net," meaning that we have subtracted interest income and capitalized interest from our total interest expense to arrive at one interest amount.  our consolidated interest expense net of interest income before certain items, decreased $79 million in 2016 and increased $277 million in 2015, respectively, when compared with the respective prior year. the decrease in interest expense in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower weighted average debt balances, partially offset by a slightly higher overall weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt. the increase in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to higher weighted average debt balances as a result of capital expenditures, joint venture contributions and acquisitions that were made during 2014 and 2015, and incremental debt borrowings to fund the $3.9 billion cash portion of the merger transactions in november 2014.
we use interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our long-term fixed rate debt securities (senior notes) into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 28% and 27%, respectively, of our debt balances (excluding debt fair value adjustments) were subject to variable interest rates-either as short-term or long-term variable rate debt obligations or as fixed-rate debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps. for more information on our interest rate swaps, see note 14 "risk management-interest rate risk management" to our consolidated financial statements.
after taking into effect the certain items, the corporate expense for 2016 and 2015 increased by $5 million for each respective period when compared with the respective prior year.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, represents the allocation of our consolidated net income attributable to all outstanding ownership interests in our consolidated subsidiaries that are not held by us.  net income attributable to noncontrolling interests before certain items for 2016 as compared to 2015 increased $3 million (17%). the $1,399 million decrease (99%) for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to our purchase of the kmp and epb limited partner units and kmr shares formerly owned by the public in the fourth quarter of 2014 as part of the merger transactions.
income taxes year ended december 31, 2016 versus year ended december 31, 2015
our tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2016 is approximately $917 million, as compared with 2015 tax expense of $564 million.  the $353 million increase in tax expense is primarily due to (i) an increase in our earnings as a result of lower impairments in 2016; (ii) the year over year increase in the deferred state tax expense as a result of our sale of a 50% interest in sng in 2016 and the hiland acquisition in 2015; and (iii) valuation allowances recorded in 2016 for foreign tax credits and capital loss carryforwards for which we do not expect to recognize any future tax benefits. these increases are partially offset by adjustments to our income tax reserve for uncertain tax positions.
year ended december 31, 2015 versus year ended december 31, 2014
our tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2015 was $564 million, as compared with 2014 tax expense of $648 million.  the $84 million decrease in tax expense is due primarily to (i) the tax impact of lower pretax earnings in 2015 primarily due to our recognition of $929 million of impairments on long-lived assets and investments and $1,150 million
58
goodwill impairment of natural gas pipelines non-regulated midstream assets, of which $882 million is not tax deductible; (ii) the tax benefit of an increase in the deferred state tax rate as a result of the hiland acquisition; (iii) the 2014 recording of a valuation allowance related to our investment in ngpl; and (iv) the elimination, as a result of the merger transactions, of the amortization of the deferred charge recorded as a result of the drop-downs of tgp, epng, and the midstream assets. these decreases are partially offset by the 2014 benefit of a worthless stock deduction related to our brazil operations.
liquidity and capital resources general as of december 31, 2016, we had $684 million of "cash and cash equivalents," an increase of $455 million (199%) from december 31, 2015.  we believe our cash position, remaining borrowing capacity on our credit facility (discussed below in "-short-term liquidity"), and our cash flows from operating activities are adequate to allow us to manage our day-to-day cash requirements and anticipated obligations as discussed further below.
we have consistently generated substantial cash flow from operations, providing a source of funds of $4,787 million and $5,303 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. the year-to-year decrease is discussed below in "cash flows-operating activities." we have relied on cash provided from operations to fund our operations as well as our debt service, sustaining capital expenditures, and dividend payments, and during 2016, to fund our expansion capital expenditures.
on september 1, 2016, we completed the sale of a 50% interest in our sng natural gas pipeline system to southern company, receiving proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion. we used the proceeds from this transaction to reduce outstanding debt. in addition to repaying outstanding commercial paper and credit facility borrowings, proceeds from the sale were also used on september 30, 2016 to repay the $332 million principal amount of copano's 7.125% notes due 2021, and on october 1, 2016, to repay the $749 million principal amount of hiland's 7.25% senior notes due 2020 (see note 9 "debt"). as of september 1, 2016, sng had $1,211 million of debt outstanding (including a current portion of $500 million) which is no longer consolidated on our balance sheet.
on august 16, 2016, cig completed a private offering of $375 million in principal amount of 4.15% senior notes due august 15, 2026. we received net proceeds of $372 million from the offering and used the proceeds from the sale of the notes to reduce debt incurred as the result of the repayment of cig's senior notes that matured in 2015 and for general corporate purposes.
on january 26, 2016, we announced the issuance of a new $1.0 billion term loan facility and the expansion of our revolving credit facility from $4.0 billion to $5.0 billion. the proceeds of the three-year unsecured term loan facility were used to refinance maturing long-term debt.
in general, we expect that our short-term liquidity needs will be met primarily through retained cash from operations, short-term borrowings or by issuing new long-term debt to refinance certain of our maturing long-term debt obligations. we also expect that our current common stock dividend level will allow us to use retained cash to fund our growth projects in 2017. moreover, as a result of our current common stock dividend policy and by continuing to focus on high-grading our growth project backlog to allocate capital to the highest return opportunities, we do not expect to need to access the equity capital markets to fund our growth projects for the foreseeable future.
credit ratings and capital market liquidity we believe that our capital structure will continue to allow us to achieve our business objectives. we expect that our short-term liquidity needs will be met primarily through retained cash from operations or short-term borrowings. however, over the long term, we are subject to uncertain capital market conditions and there can be no assurance we will be able or willing to access the public or private markets for equity and/or long-term senior notes in the future. if we were unable or unwilling to access the capital markets, we would be required to either continue utilizing internally generated cash, restrict expansion capital expenditures and/or potential future acquisitions or pursue debt financing alternatives, some of which could involve higher costs or negatively affect our and/or our subsidiaries' credit ratings.
as of december 31, 2016, our short-term corporate debt ratings were a-3, prime-3 and f3 at standard and poor's, moody's investor services and fitch ratings, inc., respectively.

the following table represents kmi's and kmp's senior unsecured debt ratings as of december 31, 2016.

as of december 31, 2016, our $2,696 million of short-term debt consisted primarily of senior notes that mature in 2017. we intend to refinance our short-term debt through credit facility borrowings, commercial paper borrowings, or by issuing new long-term debt or paying down short-term debt using cash retained from operations or received from asset sales. our short-term debt balance as of december 31, 2015 was $821 million.
we had working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) deficits of $2,695 million and $1,241 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. our current liabilities may include short-term borrowings used to finance our expansion capital expenditures, which we may periodically replace with long-term financing and/or partially pay down using retained cash from operations. the overall $1,454 million (117%) unfavorable change from year-end 2015 was primarily due to a net increase in our current portion of long-term debt, offset partially by a favorable change in cash. generally, our working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments, timing differences in the collection and payment of receivables and payables, the change in fair value of our derivative contracts, and changes in our cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of excess cash from operations after payments for investing and financing activities (discussed below in "-long-term financing" and "- capital expenditures").
we employ a centralized cash management program for our u.s.-based bank accounts that concentrates the cash assets of our wholly owned subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purpose of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing. these programs provide that funds in excess of the daily needs of our wholly owned subsidiaries are concentrated, consolidated or otherwise made available for use by other entities within the consolidated group. we place no material restrictions on the ability to move cash between entities, payment of intercompany balances or the ability to upstream dividends to kmi other than restrictions that may be contained in agreements governing the indebtedness of those entities.
certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries are subject to ferc-enacted reporting requirements for oil and natural gas pipeline companies that participate in cash management programs. ferc-regulated entities subject to these rules must, among other things, place their cash management agreements in writing, maintain current copies of the documents authorizing and supporting their cash management agreements, and file documentation establishing the cash management program with the ferc.
long-term financing our equity consists of class p common stock and mandatory convertible preferred stock each with a par value of $0.01 per share. in 2015, through an equity distribution agreement, we issued and sold through or to our sales agents and/or principals shares of our class p common stock. for more information on our equity issuances during 2015 and our equity distribution agreement, see note 11, "stockholders' equity" to our consolidated financial statements.
from time to time, we issue long-term debt securities, often referred to as senior notes.  all of our senior notes issued to date, other than those issued by certain of our subsidiaries, generally have very similar terms, except for interest rates, maturity dates and prepayment premiums. all of our fixed rate senior notes provide that the notes may be redeemed at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date, and, in most cases, plus a make-whole premium.  in addition, from time to time our subsidiaries, have issued long-term debt securities. furthermore, we and almost all of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are parties to a cross guaranty wherein we each
60
guarantee the debt of each other. see note 19 "guarantee of securities of subsidiaries" to our consolidated financial statements. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, the aggregate principal amount outstanding of our various long-term debt obligations (excluding current maturities) was $36,205 million and $40,732 million, respectively. for more information regarding our debt-related transactions in 2016, see note 9 "debt" to our consolidated financial statements.
we achieve our variable rate exposure primarily by issuing long-term fixed rate debt and then swapping the fixed rate interest payments for variable rate interest payments and through the issuance of commercial paper or credit facility borrowings.
to date, our debt balances have not adversely affected our operations, our ability to grow or our ability to repay or refinance our indebtedness. for additional information about our debt-related transactions in 2016, see note 9 "debt" to our consolidated financial statements.  for information about our interest rate risk, see item 7a "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk-interest rate risk."
capital expenditures we account for our capital expenditures in accordance with gaap. we also distinguish between capital expenditures that are maintenance/sustaining capital expenditures and those that are expansion capital expenditures (which we also refer to as discretionary capital expenditures). expansion capital expenditures are those expenditures which increase throughput or capacity from that which existed immediately prior to the addition or improvement, and are not deducted in calculating dcf (see "results of operations-distributable cash flow"). with respect to our oil and gas producing activities, we classify a capital expenditure as an expansion capital expenditure if it is expected to increase capacity or throughput (i.e. production capacity) from the capacity or throughput immediately prior to the making or acquisition of such additions or improvements. maintenance capital expenditures are those which maintain throughput or capacity. the distinction between maintenance and expansion capital expenditures is a physical determination rather than an economic one, irrespective of the amount by which the throughput or capacity is increased.
budgeting of maintenance capital expenditures is done annually on a bottom-up basis. for each of our assets, we budget for and make those maintenance capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain safe and efficient operations, meet customer needs and comply with our operating policies and applicable law. we may budget for and make additional maintenance capital expenditures that we expect to produce economic benefits such as increasing efficiency and/or lowering future expenses. budgeting and approval of expansion capital expenditures are generally made periodically throughout the year on a project-by-project basis in response to specific investment opportunities identified by our business segments from which we generally expect to receive sufficient returns to justify the expenditures. generally, the determination of whether a capital expenditure is classified as maintenance/sustaining or as expansion capital expenditures is made on a project level. the classification of our capital expenditures as expansion capital expenditures or as maintenance capital expenditures is made consistent with our accounting policies and is generally a straightforward process, but in certain circumstances can be a matter of management judgment and discretion . the classification has an impact on dcf because capital expenditures that are classified as expansion capital expenditures are not deducted from dcf, while those classified as maintenance capital expenditures are. see "-common dividends" and "-preferred dividends"
our capital expenditures for the year ended december 31, 2016, and the amount we expect to spend for 2017 to sustain and grow our business are as follows (in millions):
2016                                                            expected 2017

cash flows operating activities the net decrease of $516 million (10%) in cash provided by operating activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to:
•   a $414 million decrease in cash from overall net income after adjusting our period-to-period $513 million increase in net income for non-cash items primarily consisting of the following: (i) loss on impairment of goodwill; (ii) net losses on impairments and divestitures; (iii) losses on impairment and divestitures of equity investments; (iv) gains on early extinguishment of debt; (see discussion above in "-results of operations" for further information regarding these items); (v) dd&amp;a expenses (including amortization of excess cost of equity investments); (vi) deferred income taxes; and (vii) equity earnings from our equity investments; and
•   a $102 million decrease in cash associated with net changes in working capital items and other non-current assets and liabilities. the decrease was driven, among other things, primarily by a $195 million income tax refund received in 2015, and lower cash flow due to unfavorable changes in the collection of trade and exchange gas receivables. these decreases were offset partially by higher cash flows associated with the timing of payments from our trade payables.
investing activities the $4,001 million net decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to:
•   a $1,746 million decrease in expenditures for acquisitions and investments in 2016 compared to the respective 2015 period. the overall decrease in acquisitions was primarily related to the $324 million portion of the purchase price we paid in 2016 for the bp terminals acquisition, versus the $1,706 million (net of cash assumed) and $158 million we paid for the hiland and vopak acquisitions, respectively, and the $134 million we paid to increase our ownership in ngpl holdings llc to 50% in the 2015 period;
•   a $1,401 million net increase in cash due to proceeds from the sale of a 50% equity interest in sng;
•   a $1,014 million reduction in capital expenditures; and
•   a $291 million increase in cash due to an increase in proceeds from sales of other long-lived assets; partially offset by,
•   a $312 million increase in contributions to equity investments in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a $312 million contribution to our 50% investment in ngpl holdings llc in 2016; and
•   a $142 million decrease in other, net primarily due to unfavorable changes in restricted deposits associated with our hedging activities.
financing activities the net decrease of $2,956 million in cash provided by financing activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to:
•   a $3,870 million decrease in financing activities resulting from the issuances of our class p shares under our equity distribution agreement in 2015 with no class p share issuance activity in 2016;
•   a $1,541 million decrease in financing activities due to the issuance of our mandatory convertible preferred stock in 2015;
•   a $626 million decrease in net debt proceeds. see note 9 "debt" for further information regarding our debt activity; and
•   a $154 million increase in dividends paid to our mandatory convertible preferred shareholders in 2016;
partially offset by,
•   a $3,106 million reduction in dividend payments paid to our common shareholders; and
•   a $106 million increase in contributions provided by noncontrolling interests, primarily reflecting the contributions received from bp for its 25% share of a newly formed joint venture.

the actual amount of common dividends to be paid on our capital stock will depend on many factors, including our financial condition and results of operations, liquidity requirements, business prospects, capital requirements, legal, regulatory and contractual constraints, tax laws, delaware laws and other factors. see item 1a.

our common stock dividends are not cumulative. consequently, if dividends on our common stock are not paid at the intended levels, our common stockholders are not entitled to receive those payments in the future. our common stock dividends generally will be paid on or about the 15th day of each february, may, august and november.

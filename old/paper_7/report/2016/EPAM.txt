the key highlights of our consolidated results for 2016 were as follows:
•   we recorded revenues of $1.16 billion, or a 26.9% increase from $914.1 million reported last year, making fiscal 2016 a milestone year, having crossed the $1 billion revenue mark. revenue growth excluding acquisitions, which accounted for 5.4% of total growth, was 21.5% despite significant currency headwinds.
•   income from operations grew 26.2% to $133.7 million from $106.0 million reported in the corresponding period of last year. expressed as a percentage of revenues, income from operations was 11.5% compared to 11.6% last year. a slight decrease was primarily driven by fluctuations in utilization.
•   our effective tax rate was 21.5% compared to 20.4% last year.
•   net income grew 17.5% to $99.3 million compared to $84.5 million reported in 2015. expressed as a percentage of revenues, net income decreased 0.6% compared to last year, which was largely driven by higher foreign exchange losses reported in 2016.
•   diluted earnings per share increased 15.4% to $1.87 for the year ended december 31, 2016 from $1.62 reported in 2015.
•   cash provided by operations increased $88.4 million, or 115.7%, to $164.8 million during fiscal 2016.
during 2016, we continued to expand our global delivery footprint which brought very important hands-on experience in several new geographies.this allowed us to better understand how to integrate and develop, from one side, and position and benefit, from another, such new global delivery locations within the company and within our clients. we are confident that our strategy of combining our traditional technology and engineering advantage with proven capabilities in digital transformation, design, and emerging consultancy should enable us to navigate considerable market, geo-political and economic uncertainties.
the operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period.
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), which require us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect: (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, (ii) disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period and (iii) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. we evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions, and expectations regarding the future based on available information and reasonable assumptions, which together form a basis for making judgments about matters not readily apparent from other sources. since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. when reviewing our audited consolidated financial statements, you should consider (i) our selection of critical accounting policies, (ii) the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies and (iii) the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions. we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application places significant demands on the judgment of our management.
28
an accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. we believe that the following critical accounting policies are the most sensitive and require more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. you should read the following descriptions of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report.
revenues - we recognize revenue when realized or realizable and earned, which is when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. if there is an uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. at the time revenues are recognized, we provide for any contractual deductions and reduce revenues accordingly. we defer amounts billed to our clients for revenues not yet earned. such amounts are anticipated to be recorded as revenues as services are performed in subsequent periods. unbilled revenues represent services provided which are billed subsequent to the period end in accordance with the contract terms.
we derive our revenues from a variety of service offerings, which represent specific competencies of our it professionals. contracts for these services have different terms and conditions based on the scope, deliverables, and complexity of the engagement, which require management to make judgments and estimates in determining appropriate revenue recognition. fees for these contracts may be in the form of time-and-materials or fixed-price arrangements.
the majority of our revenues (88.2% of revenues in 2016, 85.8% in 2015 and 84.7% in 2014) are generated under time-and-material contracts whereby revenues are recognized as services are performed with the corresponding cost of providing those services reflected as cost of revenues when incurred. the majority of such revenues are billed on an hourly, daily or monthly basis whereby actual time is charged directly to the client. we expect time-and-material arrangements to continue to comprise the majority of our revenues in the future.
revenues from fixed-price contracts (10.4% of revenues in 2016, 12.8% in 2015 and 13.6% in 2014) are determined using the proportional performance method. in instances where final acceptance of the product, system, or solution is specified by the client, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. in absence of a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenue is recognized upon receipt of final acceptance from the client. the complexity and judgment of our estimation process and issues related to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent in the application of the proportional performance method of accounting could affect the amounts of revenue, receivables and deferred revenue at each reporting period.
business combinations - we account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method, which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the fasb asc topic 805, "business combinations." we identify and attribute fair values and estimated lives to the intangible assets acquired and allocate the total cost of an acquisition to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values. determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and involves the use of significant estimates, including projections of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples. there are different valuation models for each component, the selection of which requires considerable judgment. these determinations will affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods. we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe are reasonable, but recognize that the assumptions are inherently uncertain.
if initial accounting for the business combination has not been completed by the end of the reporting period in which the business combination occurs, provisional amounts are reported to present information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. once the measurement period ends, which in no case extends beyond one year from the acquisition date, revisions of the accounting for the business combination are recorded in earnings.
goodwill and other intangible assets - the acquired assets typically include customer relationships, trade names, non-competition agreements, and workforce. as a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets.
29
we assess goodwill for impairment as of october 31st of each fiscal year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of our reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying value. when conducting our annual goodwill impairment assessment, we use a three-step process. the first step is to perform an optional qualitative evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value, using an assessment of relevant events and circumstances. in performing this assessment, we are required to make assumptions and judgments including but not limited to an evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as they relate to our business, industry and market trends, as well as the overall future financial performance of our reporting unit and future opportunities in the markets in which it operates. if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we are not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for impairment. however, if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment, we perform a second step for our reporting unit, consisting of a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment. this quantitative assessment requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit and compare the estimated fair value to its respective carrying value (including goodwill) as of the date of the impairment test. the third step, employed for our reporting unit if it fails the second step, is used to measure the amount of any potential impairment and compares the implied fair value of our reporting unit with the carrying amount of goodwill.
historically, a significant portion of the purchase consideration was allocated to customer relationships. in valuing customer relationships, we typically utilize the multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach. the principle behind this method is that the value of the intangible asset is equal to the present value of the after-tax cash flows attributable to the intangible asset only. we amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be consumed utilizing expected discounted future cash flows. amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives that are predominantly ranging, on average, from five to ten years. we do not have any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
we review our intangible assets subject to amortization to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows, we will write down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified. in assessing fair value, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount rates. if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges. if the estimate of an intangible asset's remaining useful life is changed, we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life.
accounting for income taxes - we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes. we estimate separately our deferred tax assets, related valuation allowances, current tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities. the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the u.s. internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions.
the provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local and foreign taxes. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of changes. we evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognize a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
the realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future earnings. any reduction in estimated forecasted results may require that we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. once a valuation allowance has been established, it will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. a pattern of sustained profitability will generally be considered as sufficient positive evidence to reverse a valuation allowance. if the allowance is reversed in a future period, the income tax provision will be correspondingly reduced. accordingly, the increase and decrease of valuation allowances could have a significant negative or positive impact on future earnings.
stock-based compensation - equity-based compensation cost relating to the issuance of share-based awards to employees is based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant, which is expensed over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures. equity-based awards that do not require future service are expensed immediately. if factors change and we employ different assumptions, stock-based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past.
30
significant judgment is required in determining the adjustment to stock-based compensation expense for estimated forfeitures. stock-based compensation expense in a period could be impacted, favorably or unfavorably, by differences between forfeiture estimates and actual forfeitures. if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unvested stock-based compensation expense.
equity-based awards that do not meet the criteria for equity classification are recorded as liabilities and adjusted to fair value based on the closing price of our stock at the end of each reporting period. future stock-based compensation expense related to our liability-classified awards may increase or decrease as a result of changes in the market price for our stock, adding to the volatility in our operating results. as of december 31, 2016, 4.1% of outstanding equity awards were classified as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
recent accounting pronouncements from time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") or other standards-setting bodies that we adopt according to the various timetables the fasb specifies. unless otherwise discussed below, we believe the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows upon adoption.
stock-based compensation - in march 2016, the fasb issued accounting guidance to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payments. we will adopt the various amendments of the new accounting guidance in the consolidated financial statements for the quarterly period ending march 31, 2017 with an effective date of january 1, 2017. we believe the new standard will cause volatility in our effective tax rates and diluted earnings per share due to the tax effects related to share-based payments being recorded to the income statement (rather than equity). the volatility in future periods will depend on our stock price at the awards' vesting dates, geographical mix and tax rates in applicable jurisdictions, as well as the number of awards that vest in each period. while we are continuing to assess the impact of the new standard, we currently expect to recognize approximately $0.01 and $0.05 benefit to the diluted eps for the first quarter and fiscal year 2017, respectively; and approximately a 1.2% and 1.7% benefit to the effective tax rate for the same periods. however, the benefit realized from the adoption of this accounting standard could vary significantly given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future share-based transactions.
revenue recognition - in may 2014, the fasb issued new revenue recognition guidance to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers. under the new guidance, an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. a five-step model has been introduced for an entity to apply when recognizing revenue. the new guidance also includes enhanced disclosure requirements, and is effective january 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted for january 1, 2017. entities have the option to apply the new guidance under a retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented, or a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance recognized at the date of initial application within the consolidated statement of changes in stockholders' equity. we plan to adopt the new guidance effective january 1, 2018 and have not yet determined which transition method we will apply.
we have performed a review of the requirements of the new revenue standard and are monitoring the activity of the fasb and the transition resource group as it relates to specific interpretive guidance. we are currently reviewing customer contracts and are in the process of applying the five-step model of the new standard to each contract category we have identified and will compare the results to our current accounting practices, as well as assessing the enhanced disclosure requirements of the new guidance. the new standard could change the amount and timing of revenue and costs recognized under certain arrangement types and could increase the administrative burden on our operations to properly account for customer contracts and provide the more expansive required disclosures. we are also assessing pricing provisions contained in certain of our customer contracts. these provisions represent variable consideration or may provide the customer with a material right, potentially resulting in a different allocation of the transaction price than under the current guidance. due to the complexity of certain of our contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the new standard for these arrangements may be dependent on contract-specific terms and vary in some instances. we have not yet determined what effect the new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and/or related disclosures and expect to further our assessment of the financial impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements during fiscal 2017.
leases - effective january 1, 2019, we will be required to adopt the new guidance of accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 842, leases, which will supersede asc topic 840, leases. the new guidance requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. we have not yet completed the assessment of the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements or determined which transition method we will apply.
31
measurement of credit losses on financial instruments - effective january 1, 2020, we will be required to adopt the amended guidance on measurement of credit losses on financial instruments (with early adoption permitted effective january 1, 2019.) the amendments in this update change how companies measure and recognize credit impairment for many financial assets. the new expected credit loss model will require companies to immediately recognize an estimate of credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of the financial assets (including trade receivables) that are in the scope of the update. we have not yet completed the assessment of the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements or concluded on when we will adopt the standard.
results of operations the following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated. this information should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report. the operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period.

during 2015, our revenues grew 25.2% over 2014, from $730.0 million to $914.1 million. the increase was attributable to a combination of factors, including deeper penetration into existing customers and attainment of new customers, both organically and through acquisitions. in 2015, revenue from new customers was $45.7 million, primarily resulting from our acquisitions in 2015, and does not include new clients that are affiliates of existing customers whom we consider an expansion of existing business. in addition, total revenues in 2015 and 2014 included $9.5 million and $8.4 million of reimbursable expenses and other revenues, respectively, which increased by 13.1% in 2015 as compared to 2014, but remained relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues.
we discuss below the breakdown of our revenue by client location, service offering, vertical, contract type, and client concentration.
revenues by client location our revenues are sourced from four geographic markets: north america, europe, cis, and apac. we present and discuss our revenues by client location based on the location of the specific client site that we serve, irrespective of the location of the headquarters of the client or the location of the delivery center where the work is performed. revenue by client location is different from the revenue by reportable segment in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. segments are not based on the geographic location of the clients, but instead they are based on the location of the management responsible for a particular client.
the following table sets forth revenues by client location by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated:

2016 compared to 2015
during the year ended december 31, 2016, revenues in our largest geography, north america, closed at $664.6 million growing $179.5 million, or 37.0%, from $485.1 million reported for the year ended december 31, 2015. revenues from this geography accounted for 57.3% of total revenues in fiscal 2016, an increase of 4.2% from 53.1% reported in the corresponding period last year.
within north america, we experienced strong growth across all verticals despite considerable market, geo-political, and economic uncertainties: each of the two verticals, media and entertainment and life sciences and healthcare, grew above 40%; while emerging verticals and financial services grew 60.0% and 94.1%, respectively. in addition, our traditionally strong software & hi-tech portfolio grew 27.3%, which allowed us to keep this important segment at our strategic target of 20% of consolidated revenues.
we saw continued traction with customers in the pharmaceutical segment of our life sciences and healthcare vertical, and significantly grew our portfolio of customers in emerging verticals with over 30% growth in revenues there coming from customers who have been with us less than one year. combined growth in our software & hi-tech and media & entertainment verticals accounted for 48.4% of the overall growth in the north america geography, of which $19.3 million, or 22.3%, was attributable to the expansion of existing relationship with certain long-standing customers within our media and entertainment vertical.
revenues in our europe geography were $412.1 million, an increase of $59.6 million, or 16.9% over $352.5 million reported last year. revenues in this geography accounted for 35.5% of consolidated revenues in 2016 as compared to 38.6% last year. the slowdown in revenue growth in 2016 was largely attributable to decelerated growth in revenues from our top customer in this geography, coupled with increased internal and external pressures on customers within our travel and consumer vertical, and currency headwinds, primarily due to the depreciation of the british pound relative to the u.s. dollar.
33
consistent with results in our north america geography, europe experienced strong growth in the media and entertainment, life sciences and healthcare, and emerging verticals, each of which grew over 48% during fiscal 2016. over 40% of growth in life sciences and healthcare and emerging verticals came from customers who have been with us less than one year. financial services remained our largest vertical in this geography and accounted for 33.4% of the overall growth in 2016.
revenues in the cis geography showed an increase of $3.0 million, or 6.9%, from last year. the increase in cis revenues came predominantly from customers within the financial services and travel and consumer verticals. ongoing economic and geo-political uncertainty in the region, as well as significant volatility of the russian ruble limit revenue growth in this geography.
2015 compared to 2014
during the year ended december 31, 2015, revenues in our largest geography, north america closed at $485.1 million growing $117.6 million, or 32.0%, as compared with the year ended december 31, 2014. expressed as a percentage of consolidated revenues, the north america geography accounted for 53.1% in 2015, which represented an increase of 2.7% over 2014. the increase was primarily a result of growth in business from several of our top clients as well as new revenue from the acquisition of navigationarts, llc and alliance consulting global holdings, inc.
revenues from all major verticals in north america grew during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared with the year ended december 31, 2014. the largest contributor to revenue growth in north america, was its travel and consumer vertical, which increased $32.9 million, or 48.6%, as compared with the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase in this vertical was primarily driven by the rapid expansion of our strategic relationship with a large retail chain, a relationship we acquired in 2012.
our life sciences and healthcare vertical in north america continued its impressive growth since we acquired new clients in the healthcare, insurance and life sciences industries in one of our 2014 acquisitions and created synergies with existing customers in those markets. combined revenue growth from customers in this vertical accounted for $29.0 million representing the largest percentage growth of all north america's verticals at 75.9% growth over prior year.
revenues from the media and entertainment vertical in north america increased by $25.3 million, or 36.2%, as compared with the year ended december 31, 2014. the growth in this vertical in 2015 was attributable to resumed growth in revenues from certain long-time major customers who had decreased demand for our services in prior years.
north america's largest vertical, software and hi-tech, experienced growth of $24.5 million or 17.2% during the year.
the financial services vertical remained our dominant vertical in the european geography. in 2015 revenues from the financial services vertical increased by $28.3 million, or 19.0%, respectively, over the corresponding period of 2014. continued solid performance of the financial services vertical was attributable to an increased demand for our services and ongoing relationships with existing top customers located in europe. we experienced increased business from our top customer located in switzerland, who was responsible for the majority of the revenue growth in the financial services vertical during 2015 as compared with the year ended december 31, 2014. furthermore, we continue to see growing demand for our services from european-based customers within the travel and consumer vertical. during the year ended december 31, 2015 revenues from this vertical increased by $24.0 million as compared with the year ended december 31, 2014 and accounted for 35.5% of total growth in this geography during period indicated. europe's software and hi-tech vertical experienced a significant increase of 66.5% in 2015 compared to 2014, in part due to business from a new significant customer in germany engaged in 2015.
revenues in the cis geography showed a decrease of $12.8 million or 22.9% on a year-to-date basis compared to 2014. the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to a decline in the financial services vertical, which was significantly impacted by the microeconomic situation in the region. additionally, significant foreign currency fluctuations in russia and cis countries had a material negative impact on the revenues from those locations.

revenues by contract type our services are performed under both time-and-material and fixed-price arrangements. our engagement models depend on the type of services provided to a client, the mix and locations of professionals involved and the business outcomes our clients are looking to achieve. historically, the vast majority of our revenues have been generated under time-and-material contracts. under time-and-material contracts, we are compensated for actual time incurred by our it professionals at negotiated hourly, daily or monthly rates. fixed-price contracts require us to perform services throughout the contractual period and we are paid in installments on pre-agreed intervals. we expect time-and-material arrangements to continue to comprise the majority of our revenues in the future.

top five clients      $327,092          28.2   %          $298,063          32.6   %          $239,396          32.8   %
top ten clients       $442,253          38.1   %          $400,250          43.8   %          $320,126          43.9   %
during the year ended december 31, 2016, our growth rate outside the top twenty accounts was 44.3%, while the top twenty accounts grew 12.5%. while we seek to grow revenues from our existing clients by continually expanding the scope and size of our engagements, we expect client concentration from our top ten clients to continue to decrease over the long-term.
our focus on delivering quality to our clients is reflected by an average of 96.2% and 81.9% of our revenues in 2016 coming from clients that had used our services for at least one and two years, respectively. we have long-standing relationship with many of our customers, and revenues derived from these customers may fluctuate as these accounts reach their maturity or upon completion of multi-year projects. while we believe there's a significant potential for future growth as we expand our capabilities and offerings within specific domains /verticals, we continue to focus on diversification of our client concentration and building up a portfolio of accounts that we believe have significant revenue potential. we anticipate the contribution of these accounts to our total revenues to increase in the mid- to long-term and counterbalance the slowdown in the growth of certain of our largest customers as they reach maturity.
cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)
the principal components of our cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) are salaries, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, travel costs and subcontractor fees for it professionals and subcontractors that are assigned to client projects. salaries and other compensation expenses of our it professionals are reported as cost of revenue regardless of whether the employees are actually performing client services during a given period.
we manage the utilization levels of our professionals through strategically hiring and training high-performing it professionals and efficiently staffing projects. our staff utilization also depends on the general economy and its effect on our clients and their business decisions regarding the use of our services. some of our it professionals are specifically hired and trained to work for specific clients or on specific projects, and some of our offshore development centers are dedicated to specific clients or projects.
2016 compared to 2015
during the years ended december 31, 2016, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was $737.2 million, representing an increase of 30.0% from $566.9 million reported in the corresponding period last year. the increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation costs as a result of a 34.2% growth in the average number of production headcount for the year.
36
expressed as a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was 63.6% and 62.0% during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. of this increase, 1.5% was attributable to a decrease in utilization during the year ended december 31, 2016, as compared to the same period last year. while we will continue to strategically invest in our business to support its long-term growth, we anticipate utilization to reach normalized levels in 2017.
2015 compared to 2014
during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was $566.9 million and $456.5 million, respectively, representing an increase of 24.2% for the year ended december 31, 2015 over the corresponding period of 2014, mainly due to an increase in headcount of revenue-producing personnel.
the increase in cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) in 2015 was primarily driven by an increase $107.1 million in compensation costs for revenue-producing personnel, including an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $5.0 million. the increases in all of these costs were the result of organic increase in headcount as well as personnel additions from acquisitions.
as a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), decreased 0.5% over the corresponding period of 2014, to 62.0% of consolidated revenues.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses represent expenses associated with promoting and selling our services and general administrative functions of our business. these expenses include senior management, administrative personnel and sales and marketing personnel salaries; stock-based compensation expense, related fringe benefits, commissions and travel costs for those employees; legal and audit expenses, insurance, operating lease expenses, and the cost of advertising and other promotional activities. in addition, we pay a membership fee of 1% of revenues in belarus to the administrative organization of the belarus hi-tech park.
over the recent years, our selling, general and administrative expenses have been increasing as a result of our expanding operations, acquisitions, and the hiring of a number of senior managers to support our growth. we expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute terms as our business expands but will generally remain steady or slightly decrease as a percentage of our revenues.
2016 compared to 2015
during the year ended december 31, 2016, selling, general and administrative expenses were $264.7 million, representing an increase of 18.8% as compared to $222.8 million reported in the corresponding period last year. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2016 was primarily driven by a $14.6 million increase in personnel-related costs, coupled with a $16.5 million increase in general and administrative expenses related to investment in facilities and infrastructure to support the increased headcount, and $4.0 million higher spending related to talent acquisition and development.
expressed as a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1.6% to 22.8% for the year ended december 31, 2016. the decrease was primarily attributable to higher revenue growth as compared to the growth in compensation driven by the increased headcount and wage inflation, coupled with relatively limited growth in stock-based compensation.
2015 compared to 2014
we continued to invest in key areas including sales, infrastructure, industry expertise, and other functions supporting global operations and our growth. during the year ended december 31, 2015, selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $222.8 million, representing an increase of 36.1% from $163.7 million during 2014. as a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses represent 24.4% of consolidated revenues, an increase of 2.0% over last year. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2015 was primarily driven by a $48.5 million increase in personnel-related costs, which includes salaries and stock-based compensation expenses. of these personnel-related costs, stock-based compensation expenses increased $16.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2015. our selling, general and administrative expenses have increased primarily as a result of our expanding operations, acquisitions, and the hiring of a number of senior managers to support our growth.
37
in addition, we have issued stock to the sellers and/or personnel in connection with certain of our business acquisitions and have been recognizing stock-based compensation expense in the periods after the closing of these acquisitions as part of the selling, general and administrative expenses. such stock based compensation expenses related to acquisitions comprised 58.2% of total selling, general and administrative stock-based compensation expense for the year ended december 31, 2015.
depreciation and amortization expense
2016 compared to 2015
during the year ended december 31, 2016, depreciation and amortization expense was $23.4 million, representing an increase of $6.0 million from $17.4 million reported in the corresponding period last year. the increase was predominantly driven by depreciation of computer equipment and infrastructure related to increased headcount, and amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisitions of businesses completed in 2015. expressed as a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization expense was 2.0%, a slight increase from 1.9% reported in the same period last year.
depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization of acquired intangible assets, all of which have finite useful lives.
2015 compared to 2014
depreciation and amortization expense was $17.4 million in 2015, representing a decrease of $0.1 million from 2014. expressed as a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization expense totaled 1.9% and decreased 0.5% compared with 2014.
depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization of acquired intangible assets, all of which have finite useful lives.
other operating expenses, net there were no material changes in other operating expenses, net during the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period last year.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, other operating expenses decreased $2.8 million from 2014 to $1.1 million.
interest and other income, net interest and other income, net is comprised of interest earned on cash accounts in belarus and, to a lesser extent, interest expense related to our revolving credit facility, interest earned on employee housing loans, and other income.
there were no material changes in interest and other income, net in 2016 as compared to 2015.
interest and other income, net was $4.7 million in 2015, representing a slight decrease of 0.8% from $4.8 million recognized in 2014.
provision for income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance, if any, involves judgment. as a global company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. during 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had $135.8 million, $113.8 million and $94.2 million, respectively, in income before provision for income taxes attributed to our foreign jurisdictions. the statutory tax rate in the majority of our foreign jurisdictions is lower than the statutory u.s. tax rate. additionally, we have secured special tax benefits in belarus as described below. as a result, our provision for income taxes is relatively low as a percentage of income before taxes because of the benefit received from income earned in low tax jurisdictions. changes in the geographic mix or level of annual pre-tax income can also affect our overall effective income tax rate.
our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions, as well as the related net interest. tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, we cannot provide assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from our current estimates. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, statute of limitation lapse or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.

our subsidiary in belarus is a member of the belarus hi-tech park, in which member technology companies are 100% exempt from the current belarusian income tax rate of 18%. the "on high-technologies park" decree, which created the belarus hi-tech park, is in effect for a period of 15 years from july 1, 2006. the aggregate dollar benefits derived from this tax holiday approximated $13.6 million, $20.8 million and $16.8 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the benefit the tax holiday had on diluted net income per share approximated $0.26, $0.40 and $0.34 for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
2016 compared to 2015
provision for income taxes was $27.2 million in 2016 and $21.6 million in 2015. the increase in the effective tax rate from 20.4% in 2015 to 21.5% in 2016 was predominantly caused by the changes in the geographic mix of our earnings, including:
•   higher earnings attributable to our u.s. operations in 2016 driven by the growth in onsite presence in the u.s. and lower earnings attributable to foreign jurisdictions due to currency headwinds, among other factors;
•   changes in the geographic mix of our earnings attributable to foreign operations toward jurisdictions with higher statutory income tax rates;
•   full-year impact of inclusion of operating results of ags, a 2015 acquisition with its primary delivery centers in india, which has a significantly higher tax rate.
as we continue to grow our onsite presence and expand the geographic footprint of our delivery centers, we expect this may result in an increase to our effective tax rate in the near and medium term; but other factors that may contribute, favorably or unfavorably, to the overall effective tax rate in 2017 and beyond must be considered as well.
2015 compared to 2014
provision for income taxes was $21.6 million in 2015 and $17.3 million in 2014. the effective tax rate increased to 20.4% in 2015 from 19.9% in 2014 primarily due to changes in the geographic mix of our current year earnings and discrete tax benefits recorded in 2014 that didn't recur in 2015, as well as due to elimination of certain income tax holiday benefits in hungary in 2015.
foreign exchange gain / loss for discussion of the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations see "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign exchange risk."
effects of inflation economies in cis countries, particularly belarus, russia, kazakhstan and ukraine, have periodically experienced high rates of inflation. periods of higher inflation may slow economic growth in those countries and as a result decrease demand for our services and negatively impact the business of our existing clients. inflation is likely to increase some of our expenses, which may reduce our profitability, as we may not be able to pass these increases on to our clients. generally, our largest expense that could be impacted by inflation is wages. we do not rely on borrowed funds for operations in those locations; therefore, increases in interest rates typical for inflationary environments do not currently pose a risk to our business.
ukraine has been experiencing political and economic turmoil severely impacting the ukrainian economy. the ukrainian currency has been weakened and the negative outlook in the ukrainian economy continues. we have not experienced a significant impact from the inflation in ukraine and do not have significant clients located in ukraine.
inflation in russia increased in late 2014 due to weakening of the russian ruble and decreasing oil prices. inflation in russia remained steady during 2015 with some decline observed during 2016. our operations in russia have not been significantly affected by local inflation; however, we have noted some impact from inflation on our clients in russia.
belarus experienced hyperinflation in the past and may experience high levels of inflation in the future. we have not seen a significant impact from the inflation in belarus as our largest expense there, wages, is denominated in u.s. dollars in order to provide stability in our business and for our employees. we do not have significant clients located in belarus and for the year ended december 31, 2016, we had approximately $1,743 or 0.2% of our revenues denominated in belarusian rubles. the functional currency for financial reporting purposes in belarus is us dollars.
other locations where we have clients or perform services are not experiencing significant inflation and our business is not materially impacted by inflation in those locations.

results by business segment our operations consist of four reportable segments: north america, europe, russia and other. the segments represent components of epam for which separate financial information is available that is used on a regular basis by our chief executive officer, who is also our chief operating decision maker ("codm"), in determining how to allocate resources and evaluate performance. this determination is based on the unique business practices and market specifics of each region and that each region engages in business activities from which it earns revenues and incurs expenses. our reportable segments are based on managerial responsibility for a particular client. because managerial responsibility for a particular client relationship generally correlates with the client's geographic location, there is a high degree of similarity between client locations and the geographic boundaries of our reportable segments. in some specific cases, however, managerial responsibility for a particular client is assigned to a management team in another region, usually based on the strength of the relationship between client executives and particular members of our senior management team. in a case like this, the client's activity would be reported through the management team's reportable segment. our codm evaluates the company's performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit.
segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. generally, operating expenses for each reportable segment have similar characteristics and are subject to similar factors, pressures and challenges. expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as an allocation of certain shared services expenses. we use globally integrated support organizations to realize economies of scale and efficient use of resources. as a result, a majority of our expenses is shared by all segments. these shared expenses include delivery, recruitment and development, sales and marketing, and support functions such as it, finance, legal, and human resources. generally, shared expenses are allocated based on measurable drivers of expense, e.g., recorded hours or headcount. however, certain expenses are not allocated to specific segments, as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment. further, stock based compensation expense is not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by codm. accordingly, these expenses are separately disclosed as "unallocated" and adjusted only against our total income from operations.
revenues from external clients and segment operating profit, before unallocated expenses, for the north america, europe, russia and other reportable segments for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:

north america segment
2016 compared to 2015
north america segment revenues were 55.3% and 51.5% of total revenues representing an increase of $170.6 million, or 36.2%, over the corresponding period last year. the north america segment's operating profits increased $30.7 million, or 27.3%, as compared to the same period of 2015, to $143.0 million net operating profit. north america remains our most profitable segment with operating profit composing 22.3% of north america segment's revenues.
strong performance of our north america segment was predominantly driven by continued expansion of existing top customer relationships across all our key verticals, as well as strong performance of the u.s. dollar against foreign currencies.
40
2015 compared to 2014
during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 revenues from our north america segment were 51.5% and 51.3% of total revenues representing an increase of $97.1 million, or 25.9%, over the corresponding period in 2014. the north america segment's operating profits increased by $21.7 million, or 23.9%, as compared to the same period of 2014, to $112.3 million net operating profit. north america remains our most profitable segment with operating profit composing 23.8% of revenues.
the increase in revenues during the year ended december 31, 2015, was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing top customer relationships, as well as our recent acquisitions. operating results of the north america reportable segment benefited from our 2014 acquisitions in the life sciences and healthcare industry as well as acquisitions of navigationarts and ags during 2015.
europe segment our europe segment includes the business in the apac region, which is managed by the same management team.
2016 compared to 2015
europe segment's revenues were $475.0 million, representing an increase of $74.5 million, or 18.6%, from last year. during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, revenues from our europe segment were 40.9% and 43.8% of total segment revenues, respectively. during 2016, this segment's operating profits decreased $1.2 million, or 1.7%, as compared to the corresponding period last year, to $67.5 million net operating profit.
during 2016, the segment's operating results were adversely affected by a slowdown in growth of our top customer, significantly increasing pressures on operating margins and overall profitability of the segment. in january 2017, we announced a multi-year arrangement with this customer, which extended our nine-year relationship and established a minimum revenue commitment of at least $300 million over the next three years.
the segment's operating results were adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations, and particularly, the depreciation of the british pound relative to the u.s. dollar, which is the primary currency for the majority of the delivery centers that service our u.k. accounts. the financial services vertical remained our largest vertical in this segment and accounted for 30.8% of the overall growth of this segment in 2016.
2015 compared to 2014
during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, revenues from our europe segment were 43.8% and 41.0% of total segment revenues, respectively, representing an increase of $101.2 million, or 33.8%, in 2015 over the 2014 results. during 2015, the europe segment's operating profits increased by $18.5 million, or 36.9%, as compared to the corresponding period of 2014, to $68.7 million net profit from the segment's operations.
europe continues to be a growing segment in our portfolio as our business model continues to gain considerable traction with european-based clients primarily in the financial services and travel and consumer verticals. furthermore, our europe segment benefited from the continued growth of jointech, a company we acquired in 2014, with locations in south-east asia. this extended reach into a new geography created additional options for our existing customers within the financial services vertical, particularly in the areas of investment banking and wealth and asset management. we continue to expect that our new and existing customers will use our services in that fast-growing region resulting in possible revenue and operating profit increases to the europe segment.
russia and other segments
2016 compared to 2015
during fiscal 2016, we completed multi-year engagements with certain customers, which significantly decreased the portfolio of accounts in our other reportable segment. as a result, managerial responsibility for the remaining accounts in the other reportable segment was transferred to our russia segment. this change does not represent a change in our reportable segments, but is rather a movement in responsibility for a number of customers, accounting for less than 1% of total segment revenue.
41
revenues from our russia reportable segment increased $0.7 million relative to the revenues of our russia and other segments in the corresponding period of 2015. operating profits of our russia segment increased $2.5 million when compared to the operating profits of our russia and other segments in the corresponding period of 2015. expressed as a percentage of the russia and other segments' revenues, operating profits were 17.3% and 11.9% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. ongoing economic and geo-political uncertainty in the region, as well as significant volatility of russian ruble limit growth of this segment.
2015 compared to 2014
during the years ended december 31, 2015, revenues from the russia and the other reportable segments decreased by $12.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively, over the corresponding period of 2014. operating profits of the russia segment decreased $1.8 million and the operating losses of the other segment decreased $3.1 million when compared with the operating profits/(losses) of these segments in the corresponding period of 2014.
revenues and operating profits in the russia and other segments are subject to volatility resulting from revenue recognition delays related to finalizing budgets for certain arrangements with major customers in those segments causing instability of revenues and associated profits. additionally, strong foreign currency fluctuations in 2014 further destabilized the economic situation in the regions that are included in these segments and negatively impacted our business in russia and cis countries during 2015. since 2014, the united states and the european union have imposed sanctions targeting russian government and government-controlled interests and certain government officials. while this has not directly impacted our business in russia, the sanctions aggravated the overall russian economy and negatively influenced the business of our major clients in the region, decreasing demand for our services.
liquidity and capital resources capital resources at december 31, 2016, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $362.0 million and $74.1 million of available borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
at december 31, 2016, $310.2 million of our total cash was held outside the united states. of this amount, $153.6 million was held in u.s. dollar denominated accounts in belarus, which include some interest bearing deposits. as of december 31, 2016, a balance of $29.1 million u.s. dollars was kept in unrestricted accounts in our cyprus entity's bank accounts in the united kingdom. our subsidiaries in the cis and apac regions do not maintain significant balances denominated in currencies other than u.s. dollars.
the cash and cash equivalents held at locations outside of the united states are for future operating expenses and we have no intention of repatriating those funds. however, as a result of various factors such as any global or regional instability or changes in tax laws in place for a specific time period, we may later decide to repatriate some or all of our funds to the united states. if we decide to remit funds to the united states in the form of dividends, $307.3 million would be subject to foreign withholding taxes, of which $241.7 million would also be subject to u.s. corporate income tax. we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents held in the united states and cash flow to be generated from domestic operations will be adequate to satisfy our domestic liquidity needs in the foreseeable future. our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans and to meet our long-term capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash flows increase, our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from outside of the u.s. and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. to the extent we pursue one or more significant strategic acquisitions, we may incur debt or sell additional equity to finance those acquisitions.
on september 12, 2014, we executed a revolving credit facility with pnc bank, national association; santander bank, n.a; and silicon valley bank, with a borrowing capacity of $100.0 million. the revolving credit facility will mature and all amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable on september 12, 2019. there is potential to increase the credit facility up to $200.0 million if certain conditions are met. borrowings under the credit facility may be denominated in united states dollars or, up to a maximum of $50.0 million in british pounds sterling, canadian dollars, euros or swiss francs (or other currencies as may be approved by the lenders). at december 31, 2016, we had outstanding debt of $25.0 million and unused letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility totaling $0.9 million, primarily for securing collateral requirements under certain insurance programs, with the balance of the credit limit of $74.1 million remaining available for borrowing.
we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants and limitations in the revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2016, and anticipate being in compliance with all restrictive covenants for the foreseeable future.

operating activities
2016 compared to 2015
net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2016 increased $88.4 million, or 115.7%, to $164.8 million, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. the increase in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to higher customer collections as we made substantial progress in managing our billed and unbilled trade receivables, and decreased the ratio of billed and unbilled trade receivables to revenues over the course of 2016. for 2017, we anticipate the ratio to remain relatively consistent with the second half of 2016.
2015 compared to 2014
net cash provided by operations during the year ended december 31, 2015 decreased $28.5 million to $76.4 million, as compared to $104.9 million net cash provided by operations in 2014. during 2015, operating cash flows were impacted by increases in billed and unbilled accounts receivable and greater accrued expenses, which were mostly impacted by increases in bonus compensation. during 2015, we had higher accounts receivable and unbilled revenue balances as compared to the same period in 2014.
investing activities
2016 compared to 2015
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2016 was $9.3 million compared to $125.5 million used in the same period in 2015. during fiscal 2016, cash spent on capital expenditures increased by $11.4 million, which was more than offset by a $71.4 million decrease in cash spent on acquisitions of businesses in 2016, coupled with a $59.5 million increase as a result of movements in restricted cash and time deposits.
2015 compared to 2014
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2015 was $125.5 million and consisted primarily of a $30.0 million interest bearing time deposit set up by our cyprus entity in the united kingdom in march 2015 and $76.9 million net cash used in the business combinations with navigationarts and ags. the cash spent on acquisitions of businesses in 2015 increased by $39.8 million compared to 2014.
financing activities
2016 compared to 2015
during the year ended december 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $10.5 million, representing a $23.3 million decrease from $33.8 million cash provided by financing activities in 2015. the decrease was primarily attributable to a $45.1 million decrease related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility coupled with lower proceeds related to our long-term incentive plans. this was partially offset by lower payments of deferred consideration related to acquisitions of businesses, which decreased $28.0 million in 2016 compared to last year.
43
2015 compared to 2014
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december 31, 2015 was $33.8 million, a decrease of $23.4 million from the same period in 2014 primarily due to payment of deferred consideration in the amount of $30 million as well as a decrease in excess tax benefit on stock-based compensation, partly offset by higher proceeds from stock option exercises.

(1)   we estimate our future obligations for interest on our floating rate 2014 credit facility by assuming the weighted average interest rates in effect on each floating rate debt obligation at december 31, 2016 remain constant into the future. this is an estimate, as actual rates will vary over time. in addition, for the revolving credit facility, we assume that the balance outstanding as of december 31, 2016 remains the same for the remaining term of the agreement. the actual balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility may fluctuate significantly in future periods, depending on the availability of cash flow from operations and future investing and financing considerations.
(2)   we estimate our future obligations for long-term incentive plan payouts by assuming the price per share of our common stock in effect at december 31, 2016 remains constant into the future. this is an estimate, as actual prices will vary over time.
letter of credit at december 31, 2016, we had an irrevocable standby letter of credit in the amount $0.9 million under the revolving credit facility, which is required to secure commitments for certain insurance policies. the letter of credit expires on april 27, 2017 with a possibility of automatic extension for an additional period of one year from the present or any future expiration date. no amounts were outstanding against this letter of credit during the year ended december 31, 2016.
future capital requirements we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents combined with our expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and that we possess the financial flexibility to execute our strategic objectives, including the ability to make acquisitions and strategic investments in the foreseeable future. our ability to generate cash, however, is subject to our performance, general economic conditions, industry trends and other factors. to the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents and operating cash flow are insufficient to fund our future activities and requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. if we issue equity securities in order to raise additional funds, substantial dilution to existing stockholders may occur. if we raise cash through the issuance of additional indebtedness, we may be subject to additional contractual restrictions on our business. there is no assurance that we would be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all.
off-balance sheet commitments and arrangements we do not have any obligations under guarantee contracts or other contractual arrangements other than as disclosed in note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k. we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities where we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to us, or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services with us.

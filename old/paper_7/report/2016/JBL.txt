item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

overview we are one of the leading providers of worldwide electronic manufacturing services and solutions. we provide comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services to companies in the automotive, capital equipment, consumer lifestyles and wearable technologies, computing and storage, defense and aerospace, digital home, emerging growth, healthcare, industrial and energy, mobility, networking and telecommunications, packaging, point of sale and printing industries.
we derive substantially all of our revenue from production and product management services (collectively referred to as manufacturing services), which encompasses the act of producing tangible components that are built to customer specifications which are then provided to the customer. we recognize manufacturing services revenue when such tangible components are shipped to or the goods are received by the customer, title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured (net of estimated returns). we also derive revenue to a lesser extent from electronic design services to certain customers. revenue from electronic design services is generally recognized upon completion and acceptance by the respective customer.
our reportable operating segments consist of two segments: electronics manufacturing services (ems) and diversified manufacturing services (dms). our ems segment is focused around leveraging it, supply chain design and engineering, technologies largely centered on core electronics, sharing of our large scale manufacturing infrastructure and the ability to serve a broad range of end markets. our ems segment includes customers primarily in the automotive, capital equipment, computing and storage, digital home, industrial and energy, networking and telecommunications, point of sale and printing industries. our dms segment is focused on providing engineering solutions and a focus on material sciences and technologies. our dms segment includes customers primarily in the consumer lifestyles and wearable technologies, defense and aerospace, emerging growth, healthcare, mobility and packaging industries.
our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture; the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead; and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. as a provider of turnkey manufacturing services, we are responsible for procuring components and other materials. this requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing, receiving, inspecting and stocking of materials. although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap, we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers. net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of an element based on the costs of materials in that product and an element based on the labor and manufacturing overhead costs allocated to that product. we refer to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on materials costs as material-based revenue, and to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on labor and manufacturing overhead costs as manufacturing-based revenue. our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product. we typically realize higher gross margins on manufacturing-based revenue than we do on materials-based revenue. as we gain experience in manufacturing a product, we usually achieve increased efficiencies, which may result in lower labor and manufacturing overhead costs for that product.
our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities; indirect labor costs; and selling, general and administrative expenses. operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization. during periods of low production volume, we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating income margins.
we continue to try to monitor the current economic environment and its potential impact on both the customers that we serve as well as our end-markets and closely manage our costs and capital resources so that we can try to respond appropriately as circumstances continue to change.

we have consistently utilized advanced circuit design, production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers. to support this effort, our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers. most of the expenses associated with these customer-specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue. in addition, our engineers engage in research and development (r&d) of new technologies that apply generally to our operations. the expenses of these r&d activities are reflected in the research and development line item within our consolidated statement of operations.
an important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities. the majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in u.s. dollars, while our labor and utility costs in operations outside the u.s. are denominated in local currencies. we largely economically hedge certain of these local currency costs, based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge, through the purchase of foreign currency exchange contracts. changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are reflected within the consolidated statement of operations and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. see risk factors  we are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations.
we currently depend, and expect to continue to depend, upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue and upon their growth, viability and financial stability. a significant reduction in sales to any of our customers, a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us or the termination or substantial winding down of our business relationship with one of our customers has previously had, and could in the future have, a material adverse effect on our results of operations. in the past, some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of design, production or product management services ordered from us, including moving a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity. there can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly reduce or delay the volume of design, production or product management services ordered from us, or move a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity. we could in the future terminate, or substantially wind down, significant customer relationships. any such termination or substantial winding down of a customer or manufacturing relationship or change, reduction or delay in orders could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. see risk factors  because we depend on a limited number of customers, a reduction in sales to any one of those customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue, risk factors  most of our customers do not commit to long-term production schedules, or they may cancel their orders, change production quantities, delay production or change their sourcing strategy which makes it difficult for us to schedule production and capital expenditures, and to maximize the efficiency of our manufacturing capacity and note 13  concentration of risk and segment data to the consolidated financial statements.
summary of results net revenues for fiscal year 2016 increased approximately 2.5% to $18.4 billion compared to $17.9 billion for fiscal year 2015 primarily due to increased revenues from customers within our mobility business due to strengthened end user product demand during the first half of fiscal year 2016 as well as increased revenues from new business with existing customers within our telecommunications business.

during the three months ended august 31, 2016, days in inventory increased as compared to the prior sequential quarter to support expected revenue levels in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. during the three months ended may 31, 2016 and february 29, 2016, days in inventory increased as compared to the prior sequential quarter as a result of lower production in the dms segment due to reduced consumer demand in the mobility business. the increase during the three months ended february 29, 2016 also supports inventory we expected to sell in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. during the three months ended november 30, 2015, days in inventory decreased as compared to the prior sequential quarter due to increased sales activity. during the three months ended august 31, 2016, may 31, 2016, february 29, 2016 and november 30, 2015, inventory turns, on an annualized basis, remained relatively consistent as compared to the prior sequential quarter, respectively.
during the three months ended august 31, 2016, the increase in days in accounts payable from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to the timing of purchases and cash payments for purchases and higher materials purchases during the quarter. during the three months ended may 31, 2016, february 29, 2016 and november 30, 2015, the changes in days in accounts payable from the prior sequential quarter were primarily due to the timing of purchases and cash payments for purchases during the respective quarters. the decrease during the three months ended february 29, 2016 is also due to lower materials purchases during the quarter.
the changes in the sales cycle during the three months ended august 31, 2016, may 31, 2016, february 29, 2016 and november 30, 2015 are due to the changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventory that are discussed above.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. on an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances. we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. for further discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to note 1  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we derive substantially all of our revenue from production and product management services (collectively referred to as manufacturing services), which encompasses the act of producing tangible components that are built to customer specifications which are then provided to the customer. we recognize manufacturing services revenue when such tangible components are shipped to or the goods are received by the customer, title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured (net of estimated returns). we also derive revenue to a lesser extent from electronic design services to certain customers. revenue from electronic design services is generally recognized upon completion and acceptance by the respective customer. upfront payments from customers are recorded upon receipt as deferred income and are recognized as revenue as the related manufacturing services are provided.
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables not expected to be collected from our customers. this allowance is based on managements assessment of specific customer balances, considering the age of receivables and financial stability of the customer. if there is an adverse change in the financial condition and circumstances of our customers, or if actual defaults are higher than provided for, an addition to the allowance may be necessary.
inventory valuation we purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market. management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage, customer inventory-related contractual obligations and other lower of cost or market considerations. if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected, additional valuation adjustments may be necessary.
long-lived assets we review property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of property, plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the undiscounted projected cash flows that the asset(s) or asset group(s) are expected to generate. if the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its respective fair value, which is generally determined as either the present value of estimated future cash flows or the appraised value. the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management, including revenue and cash flow projections. circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy or adverse economic conditions. for further discussion of our current restructuring program, refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  results of operations  restructuring and related charges.
we have recorded intangible assets, including goodwill, in connection with business acquisitions. estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows. the fair value of acquired amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts recorded as goodwill.
we perform a goodwill impairment analysis using the two-step method on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. the recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting units carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an average weighting of both projected discounted future results and the use of comparative market multiples. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and a second test is performed to measure the amount of loss, if any.
35
we perform an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analysis on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount to the fair value. we determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets principally based on a variation of the income approach, known as the relief from royalty method. if the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered impaired.
we completed our annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 and determined that the fair values of our reporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible assets are substantially in excess of the carrying values and that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test.
retirement benefits we have pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities in certain foreign locations that are developed from actuarial valuations. actuarial valuations require management to make certain judgments and estimates of discount rates, compensation rate increases and return on plan assets. we evaluate these assumptions on a regular basis taking into consideration current market conditions and historical market data. the discount rate is used to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date. this rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments. a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. when considering the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we take into account current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets. other assumptions include demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover. for further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits, refer to note 10  postretirement and other employee benefits to the consolidated financial statements.
income taxes we estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, a process that includes estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities. we must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize the deferred tax assets. the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets. a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria. we assess whether an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return meets the threshold for recognition and measurement in the consolidated financial statements. our judgments regarding future taxable income as well as tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return may change due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws or other factors. if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future, the valuation allowances and/or tax reserves established may be increased or decreased, resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense.
the internal revenue service (irs) completed its field examination of our tax returns for fiscal years 2009 through 2011 and issued a revenue agents report on may 27, 2015, which was updated on june 22, 2016, proposing adjustments primarily related to u.s. taxation of certain intercompany transactions. if the irs ultimately prevails in its positions, our income tax payment due for the fiscal years 2009 through 2011 would be approximately $28.6 million after utilization of tax loss carry forwards available through fiscal year 2011. also, the irs has proposed interest and penalties with respect to fiscal years 2009 through 2011. the irs may make similar claims in future audits with respect to these types of transactions. at this time, anticipating the amount of any future irs proposed adjustments, interest, and penalties is not practicable.
we disagree with the proposed adjustments and intend to vigorously contest these matters through the applicable irs administrative and judicial procedures, as appropriate. as the final resolution of the proposed adjustments remains uncertain, we continue to provide for the uncertain tax positions based on the more likely than not standard. while the resolution of the issues may result in tax liabilities, interest and penalties, which are significantly higher than the amounts provided for these matters, management currently believes that the resolution will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. despite this belief, an unfavorable resolution, particularly if the irs successfully asserts similar claims for later years, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. for further discussion related to our income taxes, refer to note 5  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements and risk factors  we are subject to the risk of increased taxes.

net revenue. net revenue increased 2.5% to $18.4 billion during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016, compared to $17.9 billion during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. specifically, the dms segment revenues increased 3% due to increased revenues from customers within our mobility business due to strengthened end user product demand during the first half of fiscal year 2016. ems segment revenues increased 2% due to a 3% increase in revenues from new business with existing customers within our telecommunications business, partially offset by a 1% revenue decline spread across the remaining industries within the ems segment.
generally, we assess revenue on a global customer basis regardless of whether the growth is associated with organic growth or as a result of an acquisition. accordingly, we do not differentiate or report separately revenue increases generated by acquisitions as opposed to existing business. in addition, the added cost structures associated with our acquisitions have historically been relatively insignificant when compared to our overall cost structure.
the distribution of revenue across our segments has fluctuated, and will continue to fluctuate, as a result of numerous factors, including but not limited to the following: fluctuations in customer demand as a result of recessionary and other conditions, such as the less than anticipated product demand that we experienced within our dms segment that impacted our second, third and fourth fiscal quarters; efforts to de-emphasize the economic performance of certain portions of our business; seasonality in our business; business growth from new and existing customers; specific product performance; and any potential termination, or substantial winding down, of significant customer relationships.
on april 1, 2014, we completed the sale of our aftermarket services (ams) business except for the malaysian operations, for which the sale was completed on december 31, 2014. the ams business was included in the dms segment, and the results of operations of this business are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. see note 2  discontinued operations to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

the following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, revenue by segment expressed as a percentage of net revenue:
fiscal year ended august 31,
2016               2015                2014
ems              60   %              60   %              67   %
dms              40   %              40   %              33   %
total           100   %             100   %             100   %
foreign source revenue represented 90.7% of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 and 88.0% of net revenue for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. we currently expect our foreign source revenue to remain relatively consistent as compared to current levels over the course of the next 12 months.
gross profit. gross profit remained relatively consistent at $1.5 billion (8.3% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016, compared to $1.5 billion (8.4% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015.
selling, general and administrative. selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $924.4 million (5.0% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016, compared to $862.6 million (4.8% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue remained relatively consistent with the same period of the prior fiscal year. selling, general and administrative expenses on a gross basis increased during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015 primarily due increases in salary and salary related expenses and other costs due to increased headcount to support the continued growth of our business.
research and development. research and development expenses increased to $32.0 million (0.2% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016, compared to $27.6 million (0.2% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015 primarily as the result of new projects in targeted growth sectors.
amortization of intangibles. amortization of intangibles increased to $37.1 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 as compared to $24.4 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. the increase is due to the definite lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the plasticos acquisition that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 and the acquisitions of shemer, inala and hanson that occurred during the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2016, respectively.
restructuring and related charges.
2013 restructuring plan in conjunction with the 2013 restructuring plan, we charged $11.4 million of restructuring and related charges to the consolidated statements of operations during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 compared to $34.6 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. the 2013 restructuring plan is intended to better align our manufacturing capacity in certain geographies and to reduce our worldwide workforce in order to reduce operating expenses. the restructuring and related charges during the fiscal years ended august 31, 2016 and 2015 include cash costs of $8.8 million and $24.3 million related to employee severance and benefit costs, respectively, $0.0 million and $2.8 million related to lease costs, respectively, and $1.4 million and $1.9 million of other related costs, respectively, as well as non-cash costs of $1.2 million and $5.6 million related to asset write-off costs, respectively.
during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016, $22.7 million was paid related to the 2013 restructuring plan. at august 31, 2016, accrued liabilities of approximately $17.5 million related to the 2013 restructuring plan are expected to be paid over the next twelve months.
upon its completion, the 2013 restructuring plan is expected to yield annualized cost savings of approximately $76.8 million. the expected avoided annual costs consist of a reduction in employee related expenses of $72.5 million, a reduction in depreciation expense associated with asset disposals of $3.1 million, and a reduction in rent expense associated with leased buildings that have been vacated of approximately $1.2 million. the majority of these annual cost savings are expected to be reflected as a reduction in cost of revenue as well as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expense. these annual costs savings are expected to be partially offset by decreased revenues and incremental costs expected to be incurred by those plants to which certain production will be shifted. after considering these partial cost savings offsets, we expect to realize annual cost savings of approximately $65.0 million.
for further discussion of restructuring and related charges related to the 2013 restructuring plan, refer to note 15  restructuring and related charges to the consolidated financial statements.
38
other expense. other expense increased to $8.4 million for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 compared to $5.6 million for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. the increase is primarily due to an increase in fees associated with the asset-backed securitization programs as a result of an increase in receivables sold.
interest income. interest income remained relatively consistent at $9.1 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016, compared to $10.0 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015.
interest expense. interest expense increased to $136.5 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016, compared to $128.1 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. the increase is due to interest expense associated with the term loan facility entered into on july 6, 2015.
income tax expense. income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of 34.1% for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016, compared to an effective tax rate of 31.8% for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015.
the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 increased from the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015 primarily due to the decrease in income from continuing operations in low tax-rate jurisdictions and the increase in losses in tax jurisdictions with existing valuation allowances during fiscal year 2016. this effective tax rate increase was partially offset by tax benefits from favorable tax audit resolutions and statute of limitation expirations in non-u.s. jurisdictions during fiscal year 2016.
fiscal year ended august 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year ended august 31, 2014
net revenue. net revenue increased 13.6% to $17.9 billion during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015, compared to $15.8 billion during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014. for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014, dms segment revenues increased 39% as a result of increased revenues of 35% from customers within our mobility business due to strengthened end user product demand and 5% growth in the consumer lifestyles and wearables technology businesses, partially offset by a 1% decline spread across the remaining industries within the dms segment. ems segment revenues increased 1%, which was attributable to increased revenues of 6% from new business with customers within our telecommunications and automotive businesses, partially offset by reductions in revenue of 5% predominantly from the sale of mobility handsets as a result of our disengagement from blackberry limited.
foreign source revenue represented 88.0% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2015 and 84.5% of net revenue for fiscal year 2014.
for further discussion of our net revenues, refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  results of operations  fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 compared to fiscal year ended august 31, 2015  net revenue.
gross profit. gross profit increased to $1.5 billion (8.4% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015, compared to $1.0 billion (6.5% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014. the increase in gross profit on an absolute basis and as a percentage of net revenue is primarily due to increased revenue from certain of our existing customers within the dms segment, as well as an increased focus on controlling costs and improving productivity.
selling, general and administrative. selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $862.6 million (4.8% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2015 compared to $675.7 million (4.3% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2014. the increase on an absolute basis and as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014 was the result of an increase in salary and salary related expenses and other costs due to increased headcount to support the continued growth of our business, as well as a $45.8 million reversal to stock-based compensation expense during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014 due to decreased expectations for the vesting of certain restricted stock awards.
research and development. research and development expenses remained relatively consistent at $27.6 million (0.2% of net revenue) for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015, compared to $28.6 million (0.2% of net revenue) for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014.
amortization of intangibles. amortization of intangibles remained relatively consistent at $24.4 million during fiscal year 2015 as compared to $23.9 million during fiscal year 2014.

restructuring and related charges.
a. 2014 restructuring plan during fiscal year 2014, we recorded $49.9 million of restructuring and related charges related to the 2014 restructuring plan. we have completed our restructuring activities under this plan and do not expect to incur any additional costs under the 2014 restructuring plan.
b. 2013 restructuring plan in conjunction with the 2013 restructuring plan, we charged $34.6 million of restructuring and related charges to the consolidated statement of operations during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015 compared to $35.4 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014. the restructuring and related charges during the fiscal years ended august 31, 2015 and 2014 include cash costs of $24.3 million and $25.0 million related to employee severance and benefit costs, respectively, $2.8 million and $0.5 million related to lease costs, respectively, and $1.9 million and $1.3 million of other related costs, respectively, as well as non-cash costs of $5.6 million and $8.6 million related to asset write-off costs, respectively.
for further discussion of restructuring and related charges related to the 2013 restructuring plan, refer to note 15  restructuring and related charges to the consolidated financial statements.
other expense. other expense decreased to $5.6 million for fiscal year 2015 compared to $7.6 million for fiscal year 2014. the decrease was primarily due to a step acquisition gain of $6.2 million on a previously held equity interest investment offset by a loss associated with a cost method investment.
interest income. we recorded interest income of $10.0 million in fiscal year 2015, compared to $3.7 million in fiscal year 2014. the increase was primarily due to dividends (which are treated as interest income) on the senior non-convertible cumulative preferred stock received in connection with the sale of the ams business on april 1, 2014.
interest expense. interest expense remained consistent at $128.1 million for each of fiscal years 2015 and 2014.
income tax expense. income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of 31.8% for fiscal year 2015, compared to an effective tax rate of 102.2% for fiscal year 2014.
the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015 decreased from the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014 primarily due to the increase in income from continuing operations in low tax-rate jurisdictions during fiscal year 2015. this effective tax rate decrease was partially offset by the tax benefit from revaluing deferred tax assets related to the enactment of the mexico 2014 tax reform during fiscal year 2014, the reversal of stock-based compensation expense with minimal related tax expense during fiscal year 2014, and a partial valuation allowance release related to the u.s. deferred tax assets during fiscal year 2014.
non-u.s. gaap core financial measures the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations include certain non-u.s. gaap financial measures as identified in the reconciliation below. the non-u.s. gaap financial measures disclosed herein do not have standard meaning and may vary from the non-u.s. gaap financial measures used by other companies or how we may calculate those measures in other instances from time to time. non-u.s. gaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. also, our core financial measures should not be construed as an inference by us that our future results will be unaffected by those items which are excluded from our core financial measures.
management believes that the non-u.s. gaap core financial measures set forth below are useful to facilitate evaluating the past and future performance of our ongoing manufacturing operations over multiple periods on a comparable basis by excluding the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and related charges, distressed customer charges, acquisition costs and certain purchase accounting adjustments, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, settlement of receivables and related charges, impairment of notes receivable and related charges, goodwill impairment charges, income (loss) from discontinued operations, gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations and certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges. among other uses, management uses non-u.s. gaap core financial measures to make operating decisions, assess business performance and as a factor in determining certain employee performance when determining incentive compensation.
we are reporting core operating income and core earnings to provide investors with an additional method for assessing operating income and earnings, by presenting what we believe are our core manufacturing operations. a significant portion (based on the respective values) of the items that are excluded for purposes of calculating core operating income and core earnings also impacted certain balance sheet assets, resulting in a portion of an asset being written off without a corresponding recovery of cash we may have previously spent with respect to the asset. in the case of restructuring and related charges, we may be making associated cash payments in the future. in addition, although, for purposes of calculating core operating income and core earnings, we exclude stock-based compensation expense (which we anticipate continuing to incur in the future) because it is a non-cash expense, the associated stock issued may result in an increase in our outstanding shares of stock, which may result in the dilution of our stockholders ownership interest. we encourage you to evaluate these items and the limitations for purposes of analysis in excluding them.

acquisitions and expansion as discussed in note 16  business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements, we completed three acquisitions during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 and six acquisitions during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. acquisitions are accounted for as business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each business from the date of acquisition. see risk factors  we have on occasion not achieved, and may not in the future achieve, expected profitability from our acquisitions.
seasonality production levels for a portion of the dms segment are subject to seasonal influences. we may realize greater net revenue during our first fiscal quarter due to higher demand for consumer related products manufactured in the dms segment during the holiday selling season.
liquidity and capital resources at august 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalent balances totaling $912.1 million, total notes payable, long-term debt and capital lease obligations of $2.1 billion, $1.9 billion in available liquidity under our revolving credit facilities and up to $289.9 million in available liquidity under our trade accounts receivable securitization and uncommitted sale programs. we can offer no assurance under the uncommitted sales programs that if we attempt to sell receivables through such programs in the future that we will receive funding from the associated banks which would require us to utilize other available sources of liquidity, including our revolving credit facilities.

net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 was approximately $916.2 million. this resulted primarily from net income of $254.9 million, $696.8 million in non-cash depreciation and amortization expense, a $122.1 million decrease in accounts receivable, $68.0 million decrease in inventories and $59.0 million of recognized stock-based compensation expense and related charges; which were partially offset by a $194.3 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a $86.1 million decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities. the decrease in accounts receivable is primarily driven by the reduced consumer demand in the mobility business in the second half of fiscal year 2016, coupled with cash collection efforts. the decrease in inventories was primarily due to lower production in the dms segment in the second half of fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 due to reduced consumer demand in the mobility business. the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to increases in the deferred purchase price receivable under our asset-backed securitization programs due to an increase in receivables sold to the unaffiliated conduits and financial institutions, advanced deposits and an increase in value-added tax receivables. the decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily driven by the timing of purchases and cash payments and lower materials purchases associated with lower sales levels in the dms segment in the second half of fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 due to reduced consumer demand in the mobility business.
net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 was $1.2 billion. this consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $924.2 million principally for machinery and equipment for new business particularly within our dms segment, maintenance levels of machinery and equipment and information technology infrastructure upgrades, $242.1 million of cash paid for business and intangible asset acquisitions, net of cash received and $29.4 million of cash paid for the issuance of notes receivable.
net cash provided by financing activities during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 was $253.5 million. this resulted from our receipt of approximately $6.9 billion of proceeds from borrowings under existing debt agreements, which primarily included an aggregate of $5.8 billion of borrowings under the revolving credit facility, $500.0 million under the term loan facility, $310.1 million under credit facilities with foreign subsidiaries and $300.0 million under the 4.900% senior notes, as well as $20.9 million of net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan. this was offset by repayments in an aggregate amount of approximately $6.4 billion, which primarily included an aggregate of $5.8 billion of repayments under the revolving credit facility, $310.3 million under credit facilities with foreign subsidiaries and $312.0 million for the payment of the outstanding balance on the 7.750% senior notes. in addition, during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 we paid $148.3 million, including commissions, to repurchase 7,690,387 of our common shares, we paid $62.4 million in dividends to stockholders and we paid $10.7 million (the equivalent of 462,900 of our common shares) to the irs on behalf of certain employees to satisfy minimum tax obligations related to the vesting of certain restricted stock awards (as consideration for these payments to the irs, we withheld $10.7 million of employee-owned common stock related to this vesting).
sources we may need to finance day-to-day working capital needs, as well as future growth and any corresponding working capital needs, with additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our other revolving credit facilities described below, as well as additional public and private offerings of our debt and equity. currently, we have a shelf registration statement with the sec registering the potential sale of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities in the future, from time-to-time over the three years following the registration, to augment our liquidity and capital resources. the current shelf registration statement will expire in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 at which time we currently anticipate filing a new shelf registration statement. any future sale or issuance of equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to current or future shareholders. further, we may issue debt securities that have rights and privileges senior to those of holders of ordinary shares, and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on operations, increase debt service obligations, limit our flexibility as a result of debt service requirements and restrictive covenants, potentially negatively affect our credit ratings, and limit our ability to access additional capital or execute our business strategy. we continue to assess our capital structure and evaluate the merits of redeploying available cash to reduce existing debt or repurchase common shares.

we regularly sell designated pools of trade accounts receivable under two asset-backed securitization programs and three uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs (collectively referred to herein as the programs). transfers of the receivables under the programs are accounted for as sales and, accordingly, net receivables sold under the programs are excluded from accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. discussion of each of the programs is included in the following paragraphs. in addition, refer to note 3  trade accounts receivable securitization and sale programs to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the programs.
also, as described in note 2  discontinued operations to the consolidated financial statements, on april 1, 2014, we completed the sale of our ams business except for the malaysian operations, for which the sale was completed on december 31, 2014. we completed these sales for consideration of $725.0 million, which consisted of $675.0 million in cash and an aggregate liquidation preference value of $50.0 million in senior non-convertible cumulative preferred stock of iqor that accretes dividends at an annual rate of 8 percent and is redeemable in nine years or upon a change in control.
a. asset-backed securitization programs we continuously sell designated pools of trade accounts receivable under our asset-backed securitization programs to special purpose entities, which in turn sell 100% of the receivables to conduits administered by unaffiliated financial institutions (for the north american asset-backed securitization program) and to an unaffiliated financial institution and a conduit administered by an unaffiliated financial institution (for the foreign asset-backed securitization program). any portion of the purchase price for the receivables which is not paid in cash upon the sale taking place is recorded as a deferred purchase price receivable, which is paid from available cash as payments on the receivables are collected. net cash proceeds up to a maximum of $200.0 million for the north american asset-backed securitization program, currently scheduled to expire on october 20, 2017, are available at any one time. net cash proceeds up to a maximum of $275.0 million for the foreign asset-backed securitization program, currently scheduled to expire on may 1, 2018, are available at any one time. the foreign asset-backed securitization program was amended to increase the facility limit from $175.0 million to $275.0 million, effective may 20, 2016.
in connection with our asset-backed securitization programs, at august 31, 2016, we sold $1.0 billion of eligible trade accounts receivable, which represents the face amount of total sold outstanding receivables at that date. in exchange, we received cash proceeds of $475.0 million and a deferred purchase price receivable. at august 31, 2016, the deferred purchase price receivable in connection with the asset-backed securitization programs totaled $527.3 million. the deferred purchase price receivable was recorded initially at fair value as prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
b. trade accounts receivable sale programs in connection with three separate trade accounts receivable sale programs with unaffiliated financial institutions, we may elect to sell, at a discount, on an ongoing basis, up to a maximum of $650.0 million, $150.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively, of specific trade accounts receivable at any one time. the $650.0 million trade accounts receivable sale program is an uncommitted facility that was amended during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 to increase the uncommitted capacity from $450.0 million to $650.0 million and to extend the expiration date to november 1, 2016, although any party may elect to terminate the agreement upon 15 days prior notice. the $650.0 million trade accounts receivable sale program will be automatically extended each year until august 31, 2017, unless any party gives no less than 30 days prior notice that the agreement should not be extended. the $150.0 million trade accounts receivable sale program is an uncommitted facility that is subject to expiration on august 31, 2017 (as the agreement was extended on august 28, 2016). the $100.0 million trade accounts receivable sale program is an uncommitted facility that is scheduled to expire on november 1, 2016 (as the agreement was automatically extended on november 1, 2015), although any party may elect to terminate the agreement upon 15 days prior notice. the $100.0 million trade accounts receivable sale program will be automatically extended each year until november 1, 2018, unless any party gives no less than 30 days prior notice that the agreement should not be extended.
during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016, we sold $3.7 billion of trade accounts receivable under these programs and we received cash proceeds of $3.6 billion.

refer to note 9  notes payable, long-term debt and capital lease obligations to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
under our 8.250%, 5.625% and 4.700% senior notes, we are subject to covenants such as limitations on our and/or our subsidiaries ability to: consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, another person; create certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; create, incur, issue, assume or guarantee funded debt (which only applies to our restricted subsidiaries); and guarantee any of our indebtedness (which only applies to our subsidiaries). we are also subject to a covenant requiring our repurchase of our 8.250%, 5.625% or 4.700% senior notes upon a change of control repurchase event.
the asset-backed securitization programs require compliance with several covenants. the north american asset-backed securitization program covenants include compliance with the interest coverage ratio and debt to ebitda ratio of the credit facility. the foreign asset-backed securitization program covenants include limitations on certain corporate actions such as mergers and consolidations. at august 31, 2016 and 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants under our debt agreements and our asset-backed securitization programs.
uses at august 31, 2016, we had approximately $912.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. as our growth remains predominantly outside of the united states, a significant portion of such cash and cash equivalents are held by our foreign subsidiaries. we estimate that approximately $783.5 million of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries could not be repatriated to the united states without potential income tax consequences.
as of august 31, 2016, however, we intend to repatriate the nypro pre-acquisition undistributed foreign earnings of approximately $181.1 million to our u.s. operations. therefore, we continue to record a deferred tax liability of approximately $80.0 million based on the anticipated u.s. income taxes of the repatriation. we repatriated $225.3 million of current year foreign earnings to our u.s. operations during fiscal year 2016, which had no income statement impact due to the u.s. current year operating loss and the u.s. valuation allowance. we intend to indefinitely reinvest the remaining earnings from our foreign subsidiaries.
for discussion of our cash management and risk management policies see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
we currently anticipate that during the next 12 months, our capital expenditures, which do not include any amounts spent on acquisitions, will be in the range of $500.0 million to $600.0 million, principally to support ongoing business in the dms and ems segments. the amounts used to fund such capital expenditures will not be available to be deployed elsewhere by us. we believe that our level of resources, which include cash on hand, available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, additional proceeds available under our trade accounts receivable securitization programs and potentially available under our uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs and funds provided by operations, will be adequate to fund these capital expenditures, the payment of any declared quarterly dividends, any potential acquisitions and our working capital requirements for the next 12 months.

our 7.750% senior notes of $312.0 million matured on july 15, 2016. the proceeds from the sale of the 4.900% senior notes were used to repay the 7.750% senior notes.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of $100.0 million of our common shares during the twelve month period following their authorization. during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we repurchased 2.8 million shares for approximately $54.5 million, which utilized the remaining amount outstanding of the $100.0 million authorized by our board of directors.
in june 2016, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $400.0 million of our common shares. the share repurchase program expires on august 31, 2017. during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we repurchased 4.9 million shares, which utilized $93.7 million of the $400.0 million authorized by our board of directors. in addition, following the end of fiscal year 2016 through october 6, 2016, we repurchased an additional 1.4 million shares, utilizing a total of $124.6 million of the $400.0 million authorized by our board of directors.
on october 14, 2015, january 21, 2016, april 21, 2016 and july 21, 2016, our board of directors approved payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share to shareholders of record as of november 16, 2015, february 16, 2016, may 16, 2016 and august 15, 2016. of the total cash dividend declared on october 14, 2015 of $15.9 million, $15.2 million was paid on december 1, 2015. the remaining $0.7 million is related to dividend equivalents on unvested restricted stock units that will be payable at the time the awards vest. of the total cash dividend declared on january 21, 2016 of $15.9 million, $15.3 million was paid on march 1, 2016. the remaining $0.6 million is related to dividend equivalents on unvested restricted stock units that will be payable at the time the awards vest. of the total cash dividend declared on april 21, 2016 of $15.9 million, $15.3 million was paid on june 1, 2016. the remaining $0.6 million is related to dividend equivalents on unvested restricted stock units that will be payable at the time the awards vest. of the total cash dividend declared on july 21, 2016 of $15.6 million, $15.0 million was paid on september 1, 2016. the remaining $0.6 million is related to dividend equivalents on unvested restricted stock units that will be payable at the time the awards vest. we currently expect to continue to declare and pay regular quarterly dividends of an amount similar to our past declarations. however, the declaration and payment of future dividends are discretionary and will be subject to determination by our board of directors each quarter following its review of our financial performance.
our $200.0 million north american asset-backed securitization program is scheduled to expire on october 20, 2017, and our $275.0 million foreign asset-backed securitization program is scheduled to expire on may 1, 2018. we may be unable to renew either of these programs. we can offer no assurance under the $650.0 million, $150.0 million or the $100.0 million uncommitted sales programs that if we attempt to sell receivables under such programs in the future that we will receive funding from the associated banks which would require us to utilize other available sources of liquidity, including our revolving credit facilities.
our working capital requirements and capital expenditures could continue to increase in order to support future expansions of our operations through construction of greenfield operations or acquisitions. it is possible that future expansions may be significant and may require the payment of cash. future liquidity needs will also depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory and shipments, changes in customer order volumes and timing of expenditures for new equipment.
should we desire to consummate significant additional acquisition opportunities or undertake significant additional expansion activities, our capital needs would increase and could possibly result in our need to increase available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities or access public or private debt and equity markets. there can be no assurance, however, that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity on terms that we would consider acceptable. see risk factors  our amount of debt could significantly increase in the future.
contractual obligations our contractual obligations for short and long-term debt arrangements and capital lease obligations; future interest on notes payable, long-term debt and capital lease obligations; future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating lease arrangements; non-cancelable purchase order obligations for property, plant and equipment; and pension and postretirement contributions and payments as of august 31, 2016 are summarized below. while, as disclosed below, we have certain non-cancelable purchase order obligations for property, plant and equipment, we generally do not enter into non-cancelable purchase orders for materials until we receive a corresponding purchase commitment from our customer. non-cancelable purchase orders do not typically extend beyond the normal lead time of several weeks at most. purchase orders beyond this time frame are typically cancelable.

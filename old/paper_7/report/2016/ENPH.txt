item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward-looking statements the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. this discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations and involves risks and uncertainties. in some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "expect," "plan," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "intend," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. for example, statements regarding our expectations as to future financial performance, expense levels and liquidity sources are forward-looking statements. our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and those discussed in the section entitled "risk factors" and elsewhere in this report.
overview we deliver simple, innovative and reliable energy management solutions that advance the worldwide potential of renewable energy. we were founded in march 2006 and are a market leader in the microinverter category of the u.s inverter market. our technology was designed to increase energy production, simplify design and installation, improve system uptime and reliability, reduce fire risk, and provide a platform for intelligent energy management. since inception, we have shipped more than 13 million microinverters, representing over 3 gigawatts of solar photovoltaic (pv) generating capacity, and more than 580,000 enphase residential and commercial systems have been deployed in over 100 countries.
we sell our microinverter systems primarily to distributors who resell them to solar installers. we also sell directly to large installers and through original equipment manufacturers ("oems") and strategic partners. historically, revenues generated from the u.s. market have represented more than 80% of our total revenue.
our first commercial shipment occurred in mid-2008. our net revenues were $322.6 million, $357.2 million and $343.9 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we incurred net losses of $67.5 million, $22.1 million and $8.1 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. as of december 31, 2016, we had $17.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of $35.1 million.
although we have taken and are taking actions to improve our liquidity and help us achieve profitability, the solar market is volatile, and we are subject to market dynamics that are beyond our control. based on our cash position at december 31, 2016 and our recent operating losses, we have concluded that substantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue as a going concern within the next year. if we require additional capital to finance our operations, this determination could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of equity, incurring debt, or other financing alternatives. if we fail to raise sufficient additional capital if needed, we may not be able to completely execute our business plan.
we have seen a decline in the average selling price (asp) of our products that has been more rapid in the last eight quarters than what has been typical in the past. the decline in asp is primarily the result of our decision to lower product pricing in advance of anticipated product cost savings to grow market share. as expected, the decrease in asp has resulted in lower net revenues, gross profit and gross margins and has negatively impacted our liquidity.
we launched our next generation microinverter, the enphase home energy solution with iq, in march 2017. this microinverter is a major milestone in our product cost reduction initiative, and we believe it will lower our product cost and simultaneously add new features and functionality. we also introduced our ac battery storage system in australia in the third quarter of 2016 and in the u.s. and europe in the fourth quarter of 2016, and we believe the solar power storage market has significant growth potential.
we have taken a number of actions to reduce our operating expenses, including a reduction in our global workforce in the third quarter of 2016 and in january 2017. we also eliminated certain projects that did not have a near-term return on investment, and we have consolidated office space at our headquarters. we expect the cumulative impact of these actions to decrease our annualized ongoing operating expenses by approximately $40 million as compared to pre-restructuring annualized operating expenses, and we expect to realize the full benefit of these cost reduction actions in the second quarter of 2017.

although we have taken actions to reduce our operating expenses, we also continued to invest substantial resources to support our business, including enhancing our research and development operations to drive product cost reductions as well as developing technological innovations and new products, marketing and selling our products, and expanding into new product markets and geographies. at december 31, 2016, we had 430 employees.
components of consolidated statements of operations net revenues we generate net revenues from sales of our microinverter systems and related accessories, which include microinverter units, ac battery storage systems, an envoy communications gateway, and our enlighten cloud-based monitoring service.
our revenue is affected by changes in the volume and average selling prices of our microinverter systems and related accessories, supply and demand, sales incentives, and competitive product offerings. our revenue growth is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace by remaining cost competitive, developing and introducing new products that meet the changing technology and performance requirements of our customers, the diversification and expansion of our revenue base, and our ability to market our products in a manner that increases awareness for microinverter technology and differentiates us in the marketplace.
cost of revenues and gross profit cost of revenues is comprised primarily of product costs, warranty, manufacturing personnel and logistics costs, freight costs, depreciation and amortization of test equipment and hosting services costs. our product costs are impacted by technological innovations, such as advances in semiconductor integration and new product introductions, economies of scale resulting in lower component costs, and improvements in production processes and automation. certain costs, primarily personnel and depreciation and amortization of test equipment, are not directly affected by sales volume.
we outsource our manufacturing to third-party contract manufacturers and generally negotiate product pricing with them on a quarterly basis. we believe our contract manufacturing partners have sufficient production capacity to meet the anticipated demand for our products for the foreseeable future. however, shortages in the supply of certain key raw materials could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products. we contract with third parties, including one of our contract manufacturers, to serve as our logistics providers by warehousing and delivering our products in the united states, europe and asia.
gross profit may vary from quarter to quarter and is primarily affected by our average selling prices, product cost, product mix, warranty costs and sales volume fluctuations resulting from seasonality.
operating expenses operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative and restructuring expenses. personnel-related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories and include salaries, benefits, payroll taxes, recruiting costs, sales commissions, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation.
research and development expense includes personnel-related expenses, third-party design and development costs, testing and evaluation costs, depreciation expense and other indirect costs. research and development employees are primarily engaged in the design and development of power electronics, semiconductors, powerline communications, networking and software functionality, and storage. we devote substantial resources to research and development programs that focus on enhancements to, and cost efficiencies in, our existing products and timely development of new products that utilize technological innovation to drive down product costs, improve functionality, and enhance reliability. we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources in our research and development efforts because we believe they are critical to maintaining our competitive position.
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses such as salaries, commissions, stock-based compensation, employee benefits and travel. it also includes trade shows, marketing, customer support and other indirect costs. we expect to continue to make the necessary investments to enable us to execute our strategy to increase our market penetration geographically and enter into new markets by expanding our customer base of distributors, large installers, oems and strategic partners. we currently offer

microinverter systems targeting the residential and commercial markets in the united states, canada, mexico and certain central american markets, the united kingdom, france, the benelux region, certain other european markets, australia, new zealand and certain other asian markets. we expect to continue to expand the geographic reach of our product offerings and explore new sales channels in addressable markets in the future.
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries, incentive compensation, stock-based compensation and employee benefits for personnel related to our executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations. general and administrative expense also includes facilities costs and fees for professional services, which consist primarily of outside legal, accounting and information technology consulting costs.
restructuring charges are the net of charges resulting from restructuring initiatives implemented in 2016 to improve operational performance and reduce overall operating expense and gain on divestiture of our services business. costs included in restructuring primarily consist of severance for workforce reduction actions, non-cash charges related to the disposition of assets and impairment of property and equipment, and the establishment of lease loss reserves. see note 9, "restructuring and other charges" for additional information.
other expense, net other expense, net primarily consists of interest expense and commitment fees under our revolving credit facility, term loans, and non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of deferred financing costs. other expense, net also includes gains or losses upon conversion of foreign currency transactions into u.s. dollars.
provision for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the countries where we sell our products. historically, we have primarily been subject to taxation in the united states because we have sold the vast majority of our products to customers in the united states. as we have expanded the sale of products to customers outside the united states, we have become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales took place. as sales in foreign jurisdictions increase in the future, our effective tax rate may fluctuate accordingly. due to the history of losses we have generated in the united states since inception, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that all of our u.s. and state deferred tax assets will not be realized as of december 31, 2016.

2016 compared to 2015. cost of revenues increased by 6% in 2016, as compared to 2015, and was primarily attributable to a shift in product mix that resulted in increased sales of higher-priced accessories, including our ac battery storage system. gross margin decreased by 12.3 percentage points to 18.0% in 2016, as compared to 30.3% in 2015. while we experienced an overall reduction in our product costs, the adoption of a more aggressive pricing strategy resulted in a decrease to our gross margin. in 2016, our gross margin also included the impact of higher warranty expense, as compared to 2015. the higher warranty expense in 2016 was primarily due to incremental provisions recorded for changes in estimates, which reduced gross margin by 1.2 percentage points. see note 7, "warranty obligations" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
2015 compared to 2014. cost of revenues increased by 8% in 2015, as compared to 2014, and was attributable to the greater volume of shipments of our products. gross margin decreased by 2.6 percentage points to 30.3% in 2015, as compared to 32.9% in 2014. while we experienced a reduction in our product costs, the adoption of a more aggressive pricing strategy resulted in a decrease to our gross margin. in 2015 our gross margin included the benefit of lower warranty expense, as compared to 2014. the higher warranty expense in 2014 was primarily due to incremental provisions recorded for changes in estimates, which reduced gross margin by 2.4 percentage points. see note 7, "warranty obligations" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

2016 compared to 2015. research and development expenses decreased by $0.1 million in 2016 as compared to 2015. the decrease is primarily due to decreased compensation costs and depreciation expense as a result of the restructuring actions taken in september 2016. the decrease was partially offset by higher outside professional fees utilized to support the development of new products as well as enhancements and cost reductions to existing products. although the amount of research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to the differing levels and stages of development activity, we expect it to decrease in the near-term as we realize the full benefits of our operating expense reduction initiatives.
2015 compared to 2014. research and development expenses increased by $5.4 million in 2015 as compared to 2014. this increase was primarily due to an increase in research and development headcount, which resulted in increased expense of $3.9 million from salaries and stock-based compensation partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs. in addition, there was an increase in outside contract services of $1.0 million to support the development of new products as well as enhancements and cost reductions to existing products. the remaining increase of $0.5 million was attributed to higher depreciation and amortization related to research and development equipment.

2016 compared to 2015. sales and marketing expenses decreased by $7.1 million in 2016 as compared to 2015. the decrease was primarily due to an $8.4 million decrease in compensation costs as a result of lower headcount and a $1.4 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenses as a result of cost savings initiatives. these decreases were partially offset by a $1.6 million increase in bad debt expense and a $1.8 million benefit related to a revaluation of acquisition-related contingent consideration liability that was recorded in 2015. we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease in the near term as we realize the full benefits of the cost savings initiatives we have implemented.
2015 compared to 2014. sales and marketing expenses increased by $4.9 million in 2015 as compared to 2014. this increase was primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing headcount during the first nine months of 2015, which resulted in increased expense of $4.0 million from salaries and stock-based compensation partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs. other increases include a $1.3 million increase in bad debt expense, $0.7 million in marketing and consulting expenses and a $0.7 million increase in facilities related costs. these increases were partially offset by a $1.8 million benefit related to a revaluation of acquisition-related contingent consideration liability.

2016 compared to 2015. general and administrative expenses decreased by $3.4 million in 2016 as compared to 2015. the decrease was primarily the result of a $1.7 million reduction in compensation costs due to lower headcount, a $0.2 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenses and a $1.8 million reduction in professional services, which was primarily attributable to lower legal and other professional fees. this decrease was partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in corporate expenses including rent, utilities and depreciation. we expect general and administrative expenses to decline in the near term as we realize the benefits of the cost savings initiatives we have implemented.
2015 compared to 2014. general and administrative expenses slightly decreased in 2015 as compared to 2016. personnel-related costs decreased $2.5 million primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense in 2015, as compared to 2014. this decrease was offset by a $1.4 million increase related to corporate-level expenses, including rent, utilities and depreciation related to corporate fixed assets, a $0.5 million increase in recruiting costs and a $0.3 million increase in professional services costs.

2016 compared to 2015. other expense increased by $1.9 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily as a result of higher interest paid due to higher average outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility in 2016 and interest paid on an additional $25 million of term debt that funded in july 2016.
38
2015 compared to 2014. other expense decreased $2.9 million in 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of lower interest paid due to the full repayment of our term loan with hercules technology growth capital, inc. in december 2014.
liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2016, we had $17.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of $35.1 million. cash and cash equivalents held in the united states was $9.6 million and consisted primarily of non-interest bearing checking deposits, with the remainder held in various foreign subsidiaries. we consider amounts held outside the u.s. to be accessible and have provided for the estimated u.s. income tax liability associated with the potential repatriation our foreign earnings.
although we have taken actions to improve our liquidity and help us achieve profitability, the solar market is volatile, and we are subject to market dynamics that are beyond our control. based on our cash position at december 31, 2016 and our recent operating losses, we have concluded that substantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue as a going concern within the next year. the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2016 are presented on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. information about the actions we have taken and are taking to mitigate our liquidity constraints is presented below.
actions we have taken to reduce our operating expenses include a reduction in our global workforce in third quarter of 2016 and a second reduction in january of 2017. we also eliminated certain projects that did not have a near-term return on investment, consolidated office space at our headquarters and divested our services business. we expect the cumulative impact of these actions to decrease our operating expenses by approximately 35%, and we expect to realize the full benefit beginning in the second quarter of 2017.
sources of liquidity we have taken and are taking actions to improve our liquidity, including raising funds in the capital markets. in 2016, we completed a public offering of 13,000,000 shares of our common stock. including the subsequent over-allotment, we sold approximately 15 million shares and realized net proceeds of approximately $16.2 million.
in december of 2016, we entered into an at the market issuance sales agreement (atm) under which we may sell shares of our common stock up to a gross aggregate offering price of $17.0 million. we are not obligated to make any sales of the shares under the sales agreement. as of december 31, 2016, we had not sold any shares under the atm. we will have realized the full $17.0 million of gross proceeds available under the atm at the time of this filing.
in january 2017, we completed a private placement of common stock that resulted in gross proceeds of $10.0 million.
in july 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the "term loan agreement" or "original term loan agreement") with lenders that are affiliates of tennenbaum capital partners, llc ("tcp"), which has subsequently been amended and modified as discussed below and in notes 10, "debt" and 18, "subsequent event." under the agreement, the lenders committed to advance a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to $25.0 million with a maturity date of july 1, 2020. we drew down the $25.0 million term loan commitment at closing.
payments under the original agreement are interest only through june 30, 2017, followed by consecutive equal monthly payments of principal plus accrued interest beginning on july 1, 2017 and continuing through the maturity date. the original term loan agreement provides for an interest rate per annum equal to the higher of (i) 10.25% or (ii) libor plus 9.5625%, subject to a 1.0% reduction if we achieve minimum levels of revenue and ebitda (each as defined in the term loan agreement) for the twelve-consecutive month period ending june 30, 2017 as set forth in the term loan agreement. in addition, we paid a commitment fee of 3.3% of the loan amount upon closing and a closing fee of 10.0% of the loan amount is payable in four equal installments at each anniversary of the closing date. we may elect to prepay the loan by incurring a prepayment fee between 1% and 3% of the principal amount of the term loan depending on the timing and circumstances of prepayment.
39
the term loan is secured by a second-priority security interest on substantially all our assets except intellectual property. the term loan agreement does not contain any financial covenants, but is subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants including restrictions on creation of liens, dispositions of assets, dividends, mergers, or changing the nature of its business, in each case, subject to certain customary exceptions. in addition, the term loan agreement contains certain customary events of default including, but not limited to, failure to pay interest, principal and fees or other amounts when due, material breach of any representation or warranty, covenant defaults, cross defaults to other material indebtedness, events of bankruptcy and the occurrence of a material adverse change (as defined in the agreement) to our business. the term loan agreement offers tcp typical rights and remedies in any event of default, including the ability to declare all amounts outstanding immediately due and payable. we do not expect the lender to declare default under any event, including the material adverse change clause.
in 2016 we had a $50.0 million revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank, n.a. ("wells fargo") that was entered into on november 7, 2012, as first amended on february 14, 2014. on december 18, 2015, we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement with wells fargo (the "revolver") which extended the maturity date from november 7, 2016 to november 7, 2019 and added an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility by $25.0 million, subject to certain approvals and meeting certain criteria.
availability under the revolver was subject to a borrowing base calculation that limits availability to a percentage of eligible domestic accounts receivable plus a percentage of the value of eligible domestic inventory, less certain reserves. borrowings under the revolver bear interest in cash at an annual rate equal to, at our option, either libor or a "base rate" that was comprised of, among other things, the prime rate, plus a margin that was between 1.0% and 3.75% depending on the currency borrowed and the specific term of repayment. the revolver required us to pay a commitment fee between 0.25% and 0.375% based on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit commitment.
the revolver was secured by a pledge of substantially all our assets other than intellectual property and contains customary affirmative and negative covenants (including restricting our ability to make dividend payments) and events of default. in addition, the revolver required us to maintain at least $15.0 million of liquidity at all times, of which at least $12.5 million had to be undrawn availability. as of december 31, 2016, the company was in compliance with such covenants under the revolver.
as of december 31, 2016, the amount outstanding under the revolver was $10.1 million leaving an unused borrowing capacity of $12.9 million. the weighted-average interest rate related to these borrowings was 5.3%.
in february 2017, we amended our loan and security agreement with tcp to provide an additional $25 million in principal. we simultaneously terminated our revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank, n.a., and the combined principal and interest balance of $10.3 million was fully repaid. the new loan has the same july 1, 2020 maturity date as the original tcp loan, both of which are now interest only until february 2018. see notes 10, "debt" and 18, "subsequent event" for further information.

net cash (used in) provided by financing activities        34,375                  20,564                (3,342    )
cash flows from operating activities for 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $33.0 million, primarily resulting from a net loss of $67.5 million. the net loss was partially offset by non-cash charges including stock-based compensation of $10.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $10.6 million, asset impairment and restructuring charges of $3.2 million, and an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts of $3.1 million. in addition, the effect of changes in net operating assets and liabilities provided cash of $7.2 million.
40
the primary sources of cash from changes in net operating assets and liabilities were an $11.3 million increase in deferred revenue related to our enlighten service and deferred product revenue, $8.8 million decrease in inventory, and a $8.9 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. offsetting these sources of cash was an increase in accounts receivable of $18.0 million and an increase in other assets of $4.8 million. the increase in accounts receivable was due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, and the increase in other assets was primarily attributable to an increase in customer financing receivables.
for 2015, net cash used in operating activities was $21.2 million, primarily resulting from a net loss of $22.1 million. the net loss was partially offset by non-cash charges including stock-based compensation of $12.7 million, depreciation and amortization of $10.5 million, and net adjustments of $1.0 million for other non-cash items. in addition, the effect of changes in net operating assets and liabilities resulted in the use of cash totaling $23.3 million.
the primary use of cash from changes in net operating assets and liabilities was attributable to a $19.2 million increase in inventory. the increase in inventory was attributed to lower sales in the fourth quarter of 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014. other uses of cash from changes in net operating assets and liabilities included a $5.3 million increase in other assets primarily attributable to an increase in customer financing receivables and the corresponding deferred costs of revenues, $3.4 million decrease in warranty obligations, $2.6 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued other liabilities due to timing of payments and a decrease in incentive compensation accrual and $2.5 million increase in accounts receivable. offsetting these uses of cash was an increase in deferred revenue of $9.7 million related to our enlighten service as well as deferred product revenue corresponding with the increase in customer financing receivables.
for 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $24.2 million. our net loss of $8.1 million was more than offset by non-cash charges and net changes in operating assets and liabilities. non-cash charges included $9.7 million of stock-based compensation, $8.3 million of depreciation and amortization and $1.4 million of other non-cash charges. in addition, cash provided by net changes in operating assets and liabilities was $12.8 million.
cash flows from investing activities for 2016, net cash used in investing activities of $11.8 million primarily resulted from purchases of test and assembly equipment, capitalized costs related to internal-use software and license fees for certain technology related to asic development, and was partially offset by $1.1 million in proceeds from the sale of our services business.
for 2015, net cash used in investing activities of $12.5 million included $10.2 million for purchases of test and assembly equipment and $2.3 million of capitalized internal-use software costs.
for 2014, net cash used in investing activities of $16.5 million included purchases of test and assembly equipment and capitalized internal-use software costs. in addition, we acquired substantially all of the assets of next phase solar, inc. ("nps") for an initial cash consideration of $2.5 million, which included $0.3 million being held back to cover indemnification obligations of the selling party and recorded as restricted cash. we subsequently sold nps in 2016. we also purchased certain patents related to system interconnection and photovoltaic ac module construction for $0.8 million in 2014.
cash flows from financing activities for 2016, net cash provided by financing activities of $34.4 million primarily consisted of $24.2 million net proceeds from our term loan and $17.8 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock offset by $6.9 million net reduction in borrowings under our revolver and $0.7 million in debt issuance and equity offering costs.
for 2015, net cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of $17.0 million from net borrowings made under our revolver to fund our working capital needs, $4.0 million received from common stock issuance pursuant to our equity incentive plans, $0.2 million in financing costs associated with the amended and restated revolving credit facility.
for 2014, net cash used in financing activities consisted of $8.7 million related to repayment of all outstanding principal under our term loan and equipment financing facility, offset by $5.4 million received from common stock issuance pursuant to our equity incentive plans.

(1)   because borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility can fluctuate, interest payments have been excluded from the calculation of future contractual obligations related to the revolving credit facility.
(2)   purchase obligations include amounts related to component inventory that our primary contract manufacturer procures on our behalf in accordance with our production forecast and a take-or-pay supply agreement for the purchase of silicone encapsulates that expires on december 31, 2018. the timing of purchases in future periods could differ materially from estimates presented above due to fluctuations in demand requirements related to varying sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions.
as of december 31, 2016, the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions, including associated interest and penalties, was approximately $1.1 million. since the ultimate amount and timing of cash settlements cannot be predicted due to the high degree of uncertainty, liabilities for uncertain tax positions are excluded from the contractual obligations table. see note 10, "debt" and note 14, "income taxes" to the consolidated financial statements.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2016, we did not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of regulation s-k.
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
for a description of our significant accounting policies, see note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements. an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we generate revenue from sales of our microinverter systems, which include microinverter units and related accessories, an envoy communications gateway, our cloud-based enlighten monitoring service, and ac battery
42
storage solutions to distributors, large installers, oems and strategic partners. enlighten service revenue represented less than 2% of the total revenues for all periods presented.
revenue from sales of our products is recognized when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery of the products has occurred in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer; (iii) the sale price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection is reasonably assured. provisions for rebates, sales incentives, and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in revenue in the same period the related sales are recorded.
sales of an envoy communications gateway include the enlighten cloud-based monitoring service. the allocation of revenue between the two deliverables is based on our best estimate of selling price determined by considering multiple factors including, internal costs, gross margin and historical pricing practices. after allocating the overall consideration from such sale to each deliverable using a best estimate of the selling price, (i) revenue from the sale of envoy devices is recognized upon shipment, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met and (ii) revenue from the cloud-based monitoring service is recognized ratably over the estimated economic life of the related envoy devices of 10 years.
inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. market is current replacement cost (by purchase or by reproduction, dependent on the type of inventory). in cases where market exceeds net realizable value (i.e., estimated selling price less reasonably predictable costs of completion and disposal), inventories are stated at net realizable value. market is not considered to be less than net realizable value reduced by an allowance for an approximately normal profit margin. we determine cost on a first-in first-out basis. certain factors could affect the realizable value of its inventory, including customer demand and market conditions. management assesses the valuation on a quarterly basis and writes down the value for any excess and obsolete inventory based upon expected demand, anticipated sales price, effect of new product introductions, product obsolescence, customer concentrations, product merchantability and other factors. inventory write-downs are equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and market. the impact of changes in the inventory valuation allowance for 2016, 2015, and 2014 were insignificant.
warranty obligations microinverters sold through december 31, 2013
our warranty accrual provides for the replacement of microinverter units that fail during the product's warranty term (15 years for first and second generation microinverters and up to 25 years for third and fourth generation microinverters). on a quarterly basis, we employ a consistent, systematic and rational methodology to assess the adequacy of its warranty liability. this assessment includes updating all key estimates and assumptions for each generation of product, based on historical results, trends and the most current data available as of the filing date. the key estimates and assumptions used in the warranty liability are thoroughly reviewed by management on a quarterly basis. the key estimates used by us to estimate its warranty liability are: (1) the number of units expected to fail over time (i.e. failure rate); (2) the number of failed units expected to result in warranty claims over time (i.e. claim rate); and (3) the per unit cost of replacement units, including outbound shipping and limited labor costs, expected to be incurred to replace failed units over time (i.e. replacement cost).
estimated failure rates-our quality and reliability department has primary responsibility to determine the estimated failure rates for each generation of microinverter. to establish initial failure rate estimates for each generation of microinverter, our quality engineers use a combination of industry standard mtbf (mean time between failure) estimates for individual components contained in that generation of microinverters, third party data collected on similar equipment deployed in outdoor environments similar to those in which our microinverters are installed, and rigorous long term reliability and accelerated life cycle testing which simulates the service life of the microinverter in a short period of time. as units are deployed into operating environments, we continue to monitor product performance via our enlighten monitoring platform. it typically takes three to nine months between the date of sale and date of end-user installation. consequently, our ability to monitor actual failures of units sold similarly lags by three to nine months. when a microinverter fails and is returned, we perform diagnostic root cause failure analysis to understand and isolate the underlying mechanism(s) causing the failure. we then use the results of this analysis (combined with the actual, cumulative performance data collected on those units
43
prior to failure via enlighten) to draw conclusions with respect to how or if the identified failure mechanism(s) will impact the remaining units deployed in the installed base.
estimated claim rates-warranty claim rate estimates are based upon assumptions with respect to expected customer behavior over the warranty period. as the vast majority of our microinverters have been sold to end users for residential applications, we believe that warranty claim rates will be affected by changes over time in residential home ownership because we expect that subsequent homeowners are less likely to file claims than the homeowners who originally purchase the microinverters.
estimated replacement costs-three factors are considered in our analysis of estimated replacement cost: (1) the estimated cost of replacement microinverters; (2) the estimated cost to ship replacement microinverters to end users; and (3) the estimated labor reimbursement expected to be paid to third party installers performing replacement services for the end user. because our warranty provides for the replacement of defective microinverters over long periods of time (between 15 and 25 years, depending on the generation of product purchased), the estimated per unit cost of current and future product generations is considered in the estimated replacement cost. estimated costs to ship replacement units are based on observable, market-based shipping costs paid by us to third party freight carriers. we have a separate program that allows third-party installers to claim fixed-dollar reimbursements for labor costs they incur to replace failed microinverter units for a limited time from the date of original installation. included in our estimated replacement cost is an analysis of the number of fixed-dollar labor reimbursements expected to be claimed by third party installers over the limited offering period.
if actual failure rates, claim rates, or replacement costs differ from our estimates in future periods, changes to these estimates may be required, resulting in increases or decreases in our warranty obligations. such increases or decreases could be material.
fair value option for microinverters sold since january 1, 2014
our warranty obligations related to microinverters sold since january 1, 2014 provide us the right, but not the requirement, to assign our warranty obligations to a third-party. under accounting standards codification ("asc") 825-financial instruments, ("fair value option"), an entity may choose to elect the fair value option for such warranties at the time it first recognizes the eligible item. we made an irrevocable election to account for all eligible warranty obligations associated with microinverters sold since january 1, 2014 at fair value. this election was made to reflect the underlying economics of the time value of money for an obligation that will be settled over an extended period of up to 25 years.
we estimate the fair value of warranty obligations by calculating the warranty obligations in the same manner as for sales prior to january 1, 2014 and applying an expected present value technique to that result. the expected present value technique, an income approach, converts future amounts into a single current discounted amount. in addition to the key estimates of failure rates, claim rates and replacement costs, we used certain inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. such additional assumptions included compensation comprised of a profit element and risk premium required of a market participant to assume the obligation and a discount rate based on our credit-adjusted risk-free rate. see note 8, ("fair value measurements") to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in november 2015, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") 2015-17, "balance sheet classification of deferred taxes," to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. the amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. the amendments in this update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position. the current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this update. we adopted asu 2015-17 during the fourth quarter of 2015 and applied it retrospectively to all periods presented. the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented and had no impact on our results of operations.

in august 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-15, "presentation of financial statements-going concern." the update provides u.s. gaap guidance on management's responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures. for each reporting period, management will be required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements are issued. we adopted asu 2014-15 during the fourth quarter of 2016. see note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies."
recent accounting pronouncements not yet effective in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09 (topic 606), "revenue from contracts with customers," which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance under u.s. gaap. the updated standard's core principle is that revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. the standard generally requires an entity to identify performance obligations in its contracts, estimate the amount of variable consideration to be received in the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to each separate performance obligation, and recognize revenue as obligations are satisfied. in addition, the updated standard requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. in 2015, the fasb issued guidance to defer the effective date to fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2017 with early adoption for fiscal years beginning december 15, 2016. the guidance permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. we have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements.
in july 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-11, "simplifying the measurement of inventory," which requires most entities to measure most inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value ("nrv"). this simplifies the evaluation from the current method of lower of cost or market, where market is based on one of three measures (i.e. replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less a normal profit margin). asu 2015-11 does not apply to inventories measured under the last-in, first-out method or the retail inventory method, and defines nrv as the "estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation." asu 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. early adoption is permitted for any interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been issued. we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements.
in january 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-01, "recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities," which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. changes to the current guidance include the accounting for equity investments, the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments, and the assessment of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to available-for-sale securities. in addition, asu 2016-01 establishes an incremental recognition and disclosure requirement related to the presentation of fair value changes of financial liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected. under this guidance, an entity would be required to separately present in other comprehensive income the portion of the total fair value change attributable to instrument-specific credit risk as opposed to reflecting the entire amount in earnings. asu 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2017, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements.
in february 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards codification ("asc") 842 ("asc 842"), "leases" which replaces the existing guidance in asc 840, leases.  asc 842 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2018. asc 842 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use (rou) asset and a corresponding lease liability. for finance leases the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the rou asset and for operating leases the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense.  we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements.

in march 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-09, "improvements to employee share-based payment accounting," which will simplify the income tax consequences, accounting for forfeitures and classification on the statements of consolidated cash flows. asu 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on the consolidated financial statements.
in january 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-04, "intangibles-goodwill and other (topic 350): simplifying the test for goodwill impairment." the provisions of this update simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating step 2 from the quantitative analysis. for public entities, this guidance is effective for years beginning after december 15, 2019, including interim periods within those years. early adoption is permitted after january 1, 2017. the adoption of this asu is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements, and we are planning on early adoption beginning with the 2017 goodwill impairment testing.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations.  we conduct many of our e&p operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions, either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement.  there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest.
15
moreover, parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone.  in either case, the value of our investment may be adversely affected.
we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business.  federal, state, local, territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims, disallowance of tax credits and deductions, expropriation or nationalization of property, mandatory government participation, cancellation or amendment of contract rights, imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds, changes in import and export regulations, limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities, anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, as well as other political developments may affect our operations.
we have substantial capital requirements, and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all.  the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas involves substantial costs, which may not be fully funded from operations.  for example, in 2016, we had a significant net loss and, if commodity prices remain low through 2017, we are forecasting a net loss for 2017.  two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating.  in february 2016, standard and poor's ratings services (s&p) lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to bbb- with stable outlook and moody's investors service (moody's) lowered our credit rating to ba1 with stable outlook, which is below investment grade.  in december 2016, fitch ratings (fitch) lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to bbb- with stable outlook.  in february 2017, s&p re-affirmed our investment grade credit rating of bbb- with stable outlook.  although, currently we do not have any borrowings under our long-term credit facility, further ratings downgrades, continued weakness in the oil and gas industry or negative outcomes within commodity and financial markets could adversely impact our access to capital markets by increasing the costs of financing, or by impacting our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms, or at all.  in addition, further ratings downgrades may require that we issue letters of credit or provide other forms of collateral under certain contractual requirements.  any inability to access capital markets could adversely impact our financial adaptability and our ability to execute our strategy and may also expose us to heightened exposure to credit risk.
political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business.  some of the international areas in which we operate, and the partners with whom we operate, are politically less stable than other areas and partners and may be subject to civil unrest, conflict, insurgency, geographic territorial border disputes, corruption, security risks and labor unrest.  political and civil unrest in north africa and the middle east has affected and may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally.  the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry.
our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities.  our oil and gas operations, like those of the industry, are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills, produced water spills, gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage.  our operations are also subject to numerous u.s. federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations.  non‐compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial clean-ups and natural resource damages or other liabilities.  in addition, increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general.  similarly, we have material legal obligations to dismantle, remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future, in most cases.  these estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations and other uncertainties.
concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources, particularly hydraulic fracturing, water usage, flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions.  while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment, regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost.
climate change initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures, reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business.  we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern.  continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions.  these agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications, operational changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs.  in addition, our production is used to produce petroleum fuels, which through normal customer use may result in the emission of greenhouse gases.  regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbons and have an adverse effect on our
16
sales volumes, revenues and margins.  the imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and significantly reduce the value of our business.
our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have.  the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive.  we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities, including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas.  many competitors, including national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources.  we are also in competition with producers of other forms of energy.  increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets could significantly increase the cost of acquiring oil and gas assets.  in addition, competition for drilling services, technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs, resulting in increased capital and operating costs.
catastrophic events, whether naturally occurring or man‐made, may materially affect our operations and financial conditions.  our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets, interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects.  examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes, fires, explosions, blowouts, such as the third-party accident at the macondo prospect, pipeline interruptions and ruptures, severe weather, geological events, labor disputes or cyber‐attacks.  although we maintain insurance coverage against property and casualty losses, there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages.  moreover, some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable.
significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences.  we are involved in several large development projects and the completion of those projects may be delayed beyond what was originally anticipated.  such examples include, but are not limited to, delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory agencies, timely access to necessary equipment, availability of necessary personnel, construction delays, unfavorable weather conditions and equipment failures.  this may lead to delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events.  these delays could impact our future results of operations and cash flows.
departures of key members from our senior management team, and/or difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel, could negatively impact our ability to deliver on our strategic goals.  the derivation and monitoring of successful strategies and related policies may be negatively impacted by the departure of key members of senior management.  moreover, an inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations may prohibit us from executing our strategy in full or, in part, with a commensurate impact on shareholder value.
we are dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor.  an inability or significant delay in securing these services, or a high cost thereof, may result in material negative economic consequences.  the availability and cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the e&p industry.  as a result, we may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost.  these consequences may impact our ability to run our operations and to deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences.
we manage commodity price and other risks through our risk management function but such activities may impede our ability to benefit from commodity price increases and can expose us to similar potential counterparty credit risk as impacts amounts due from the sale of hydrocarbons.  we may enter into commodity price hedging arrangements to protect us from commodity price declines.  these arrangements may, depending on the instruments used and the level of increases involved, limit any potential upside from commodity price increases.  as with accounts receivable we may be exposed to potential economic loss should a counterparty be unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the terms of a hedging agreement.  in addition, we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values, and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility.
cyber‐attacks targeting computer, telecommunications systems, and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may materially impact our business and operations.  computers and telecommunication systems are used to conduct our exploration, development and production activities and have become an integral part of our business.  we use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our company and with outside business partners.  cyber‐attacks could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to our business operations or the loss of our data and proprietary information.  in addition, computers control oil and gas production, processing equipment, and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market.  a cyber‐attack against these operating systems, or the networks and infrastructure on which they rely, could damage critical production, distribution and/or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to markets, and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions.  as a result, a cyber-attack could have a material adverse impact on
17
our cash flows and results of operations.  we routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems.  although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches, disruptions, or loss of business critical information, our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations.  in addition, as technologies evolve and these attacks become more sophisticated, we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks.
item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview hess corporation is a global exploration and production (e&p) company engaged in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas with production operations located primarily in the united states (u.s.), denmark, equatorial guinea, the malaysia/thailand joint development area (jda), malaysia, and norway.  the bakken midstream operating segment, which was established in the second quarter of 2015, provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating natural gas liquids, or ngls; gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and ngls; and storing and terminaling propane, primarily in the bakken and three forks shale plays in the williston basin area of north dakota.
response to low oil prices in 2016 our industry continued to face a challenging commodity price environment leading to further reductions in capital investment compared with 2015.  our realized crude oil selling prices, including hedging, were $39.20 per barrel in 2016 (2015: $47.85; 2014: $92.59).  in response, we improved operating efficiency across our portfolio and reduced our e&p capital and exploratory expenditures during 2016 to $1.9 billion, a decrease of over 50% compared to the same period in 2015, which partially contributed to our lower 2016 oil and gas production levels.
in addition to improving our operating efficiency and reducing our capital and exploratory expenditures, we proactively took other steps in 2016 to preserve the strength of our balance sheet and improve liquidity, including issuing equity securities and executing a debt refinancing transaction.  in february 2016, we issued 28,750,000 shares of common stock and depositary shares representing 575,000 shares of 8% series a mandatory convertible preferred stock, for total net proceeds of $1.6 billion.  in the third quarter of 2016, we initiated a debt refinancing transaction by issuing $1 billion of 4.30% notes due in 2027 and $500 million of 5.80% notes due in 2047 with proceeds used primarily to purchase higher-coupon bonds and redeem near-term maturities.  at december 31, 2016, we had $2.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and total liquidity including available committed credit facilities of approximately $7.3 billion.
we project our e&p capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately $2.25 billion in 2017 as we plan to increase from two rigs to six rigs in the bakken over the course of 2017.  capital expenditures for our midstream operations are expected to be approximately $190 million.  oil and gas production in 2017 is forecast to be in the range of 300,000 boepd to 310,000 boepd excluding any contribution from libya.  as a result of reduced capital expenditures in 2016 and a high level of planned maintenance in the second quarter of 2017, we forecast our production to decline during the first half of 2017 and then increase in the third and fourth quarters of the year with the start-up of north malay basin and a new well at the penn state field in the gulf of mexico expected in the third quarter and production increases as a result of the rig ramp up in the bakken.
in 2016, we realized a net operating cash flow deficit (cash flow from operating activities less cash flows from investing activities) of $1,295 million.  forward strip crude oil prices for 2017 are higher than average prices for 2016, and as a result, we forecast a smaller net operating cash flow deficit in 2017.  we expect to fund our net operating cash flow deficit (including capital expenditures) for the full year of 2017 with cash on hand.  due to the low commodity price environment, we may take any of the following steps, or a combination thereof, to improve our liquidity and financial position: reduce our planned capital program and other cash outlays, borrow from our committed credit facilities, issue debt or equity securities, and pursue asset sales.
consolidated results net loss attributable to hess corporation was $6,132 million in 2016 and $3,056 million in 2015.  in 2014, net income attributable to hess corporation was $2,317 million.  excluding items affecting comparability summarized on page 27, the adjusted net loss was $1,489 million in 2016 and $1,113 million in 2015.  adjusted net income in 2014 was $1,308 million.  annual production averaged 322,000 boepd in 2016, 375,000 boepd in 2015, and 329,000 boepd in 2014.  total proved reserves were 1,109 million boe, 1,086 million boe, and 1,431 million boe at december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.  lower crude oil prices in 2015 resulted in negative revisions of 234 million boe at december 31, 2015, primarily related to proved undeveloped reserves.
23
significant 2016 activities the following is an update of significant e&p activities during 2016:
producing e&p assets:
•   in north dakota, net production from the bakken oil shale play averaged 105,000 boepd (2015: 112,000 boepd), with the decrease from the prior-year period primarily due to reduced drilling activity in response to low oil prices. during 2016, we operated an average of 3.3 rigs, drilled 71 wells, completed 92 wells, and brought on production 100 wells, bringing the total operated production wells to 1,272 at december 31, 2016. drilling and completion costs per operated well averaged $4.8 million in 2016, down 17% from 2015. in 2016, we also increased our standard well design to a 50-stage completion from the previous 35-stage completion. during 2017, we plan to increase our rig count to six rigs from two rigs, for an average of 3.5 rigs, to drill approximately 80 wells and bring approximately 75 wells on production. net production for full year 2017 is forecast to be in the range of 95,000 boepd and 105,000 boepd. with the building rig count we expect our bakken production in the fourth quarter of 2017 to average between 105,000 boepd and 110,000 boepd, which would represent a growth rate of approximately 15% from the first quarter to the fourth quarter.

•   in the gulf of mexico, net production averaged 61,000 boepd (2015: 77,000 boepd). the decrease in production was the result of unplanned well downtime at the tubular bells field (hess 57%) due to subsurface valve failures in three wells, unplanned downtime at the conger field (hess 38%) due to a failed subsurface valve in one well, and natural decline. well workovers were conducted to replace the subsurface valves in the three wells at the tubular bells field and in the well at the conger field, which caused an increase in workover expense for the year. in addition, we brought online a fifth production well and one water injection well at tubular bells during the year. in 2017, gulf of mexico production is forecast to average approximately 65,000 boepd.

•   at the valhall field offshore norway, net production averaged 28,000 boepd (2015: 33,000 boepd), with the decrease from the prior year primarily due to lower drilling activity, natural field decline and a planned shutdown. net production from the valhall field is forecast to average between 25,000 boepd and 30,000 boepd in 2017. in 2017, the operator plans to drill two production wells from the existing platform rig, of which one well is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter. the operator plans to continue a multi-year well abandonment program.

•   at block a‐18 of the jda, the operator, carigali hess operating company, continued drilling production wells and completed commissioning of its booster compression project in the third quarter of 2016. production averaged 206 mmcfd (2015: 255 mmcfd), including contribution from unitized acreage in malaysia, with the decrease from prior-year primarily due to lower entitlement and downtime associated with commissioning of the new booster compression project. production from the jda is forecast to average approximately 210 mmcfd in 2017.

•   in the north malay basin (nmb), net production from the early production system averaged 26 mmcfd (2015: 40 mmcfd). in 2016, we completed the installation of three remote wellhead platforms and the jacket of the central processing platform. we also achieved mechanical completion of the central processing platform topsides and transport to the field via a heavy lift vessel is planned for the first quarter of 2017. the full field development project is planned for completion in the third quarter of 2017, after which net production is expected to increase to 165 mmcfd.

•   at the south arne field, offshore denmark, we completed drilling of an eleven well multi-year program early in 2016. net production averaged 13,000 boepd (2015: 13,000 boepd). in the fourth quarter, the danish government awarded a 20 year extension to the south arne field license, extending expiry to 2047. net production is forecast to average approximately 12,000 boepd in 2017.

•   in the utica shale, we drilled and completed 6 wells and brought 14 wells onto production before suspending drilling activities during the first quarter of 2016 in response to low commodity prices. net production increased to 29,000 boepd in 2016 (2015: 24,000 boepd) and is expected to average between 15,000 boepd and 20,000 boepd in 2017.

•   in equatorial guinea, net production was 33,000 boepd in 2016 down from 43,000 boepd in 2015 due to lower drilling activity and natural field decline. net production in 2017 is expected to average approximately 25,000 boepd.

•   in libya, civil and political unrest has largely interrupted production and crude oil export capability in 2016. at the waha fields (hess 8%), the operator recommenced production in october 2016 following the lifting of force majeure by the national oil company of libya. net production from the waha fields averaged 1,000 boepd for the year.

24
other e&p assets:
•   at the hess operated stampede development project (hess 25%) in the green canyon area of the gulf of mexico, the topsides deck was installed on the hull and fabrication and pre-commissioning of topsides continue as planned. we also completed installation of subsea equipment at both drill centers in the field, drilled one development well, and commenced drilling on one water injector well. in 2017, we plan to install the tension leg platform and topsides, complete the sub-sea installation and continue our drilling operations with introduction of a second drilling rig. first production from the field is targeted for 2018, and is expected to ramp up to a net rate of approximately 15,000 boepd.

•   in guyana, at the offshore stabroek block (hess 30%), the operator, esso exploration and production guyana limited, completed a 3d seismic acquisition program covering approximately 17,000 square kilometers on the block and drilled two successful appraisal wells at the liza discovery. the liza-2 well was drilled to a total depth of 17,963 feet and encountered more than 190 feet of oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs in the upper cretaceous formations and included an extended drill stem test. the liza-3 well was drilled to a total depth of 18,098 feet and encountered 210 feet of the same oil-bearing reservoirs encountered in other liza wells. pre-development planning and appraisal activities are underway and we expect to be in a position to sanction the first phase of the liza development in mid-2017 with first production expected in 2020.

in 2016, the operator also drilled the payara-1 exploration well at the payara prospect, located approximately 10 miles northwest of the liza discovery, and encountered more than 95 feet of oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs.  at the skipjack prospect 25 miles northwest of the liza discovery, the operator completed the drilling of an exploration well, which was unsuccessful and expensed.  in 2017, the operator plans to drill a well at the snoek exploration prospect, a liza-4 appraisal well, and a payara-2 appraisal well.  in addition, the operator will evaluate additional exploration opportunities on the broader stabroek block.
•   at the equus project on block wa-390-p in the offshore carnarvon basin of australia, we were awarded a retention lease through 2021 covering certain areas within the wa-390-p license which include our equus discoveries. in addition, we also completed drilling of an exploration commitment well at the wa-474-p license which is adjacent to block wa-390-p. in the fourth quarter of 2016, we terminated a joint front-end engineering study with a third party natural gas liquefaction joint venture and notified the government of australia of our intent to defer further development of the project. as a result, we recognized an after-tax charge of $693 million ($938 million pre-tax) to expense all previously capitalized exploratory well costs and other project related costs.

•   in ghana, we continued development planning and subsurface evaluation. the government of côte d'ivoire has challenged the maritime border between it and the country of ghana, which includes a portion of our deepwater tano/cape three points license. we are unable to proceed with development of this license until there is a resolution of this matter, which may also impact our ability to develop the license. the international tribunal for law of the sea is expected to render a final ruling on the maritime border dispute in 2017. under terms of our license and subject to resolution of the border dispute, we have declared commerciality for four discoveries, including the pecan field in march 2016, which would be the primary development hub for the block. we are continuing to work with the government on how best to progress work on the block given the maritime border dispute. see capitalized exploratory well costs in note 4, property, plant and equipment in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

•   at the non-operated sicily prospect, in the keathley canyon area of the deepwater gulf of mexico, where two exploration wells discovered hydrocarbons, we decided in 2016 not to pursue the project due to the low oil price environment and the limited time remaining on the leases. the costs of both wells were expensed in 2016.

•   at the non-operated melmar prospect in the alaminos canyon area of the deepwater gulf of mexico, the operator completed drilling of an exploration well in 2016, where noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons were encountered and well costs were expensed.

the following is an update of significant bakken midstream activities during 2016:
•   we continued to progress the construction of facilities and the reconfiguration of pipelines in mckenzie and williams counties that are expected to increase throughput capacity for crude oil and natural gas originating from south of the missouri river for transporting north to our natural gas processing and crude oil and natural gas liquids logistics assets in tioga and ramberg and multiple third-party pipelines.

in the following discussion and elsewhere in this report, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis.  management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after‐tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings.  management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount.  after-tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts.

"adjusted net income (loss)" presented in this report is a non-gaap financial measure, which we define as reported net income (loss) attributable to hess corporation excluding items identified as affecting comparability of earnings between periods.  management uses adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate the corporation's operating performance and believes that investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure, which excludes certain items that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and are not indicative of future business trends and operations.  this measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for u.s. gaap net income (loss).

selling prices: average realized crude oil selling prices, including hedging, were 18% lower in 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to the declines in brent and wti crude oil prices.  in addition, realized selling prices for natural gas liquids and natural gas declined in 2016 by 5% and 19%, respectively, compared to the prior year.  in total, lower realized selling prices reduced 2016 financial results by approximately $440 million after income taxes compared with 2015.  our average selling prices were as follows:

crude oil and natural gas liquids as a share of total production          73   %          74   %          74   %
we expect total net production to average between 300,000 boepd and 310,000 boepd in 2017, excluding any contribution from libya.  our production has been decreasing the last several quarters as a result of reducing our capital expenditures to manage in the lower price environment.  we expect our production will continue to decline in the first half of 2017 as a result of this reduced spend and a high level of planned maintenance at four of our offshore assets in the second quarter.  we forecast production to average between 290,000 boepd and 300,000 boepd in the first quarter and between 270,000 boepd and 280,000 boepd in the second quarter. production is then forecast to increase in the third quarter with the start-up of north malay basin and a new well at the penn state field in the gulf of mexico to between 305,000 boepd and 315,000 boepd.  we expect our production will continue to grow in the fourth quarter as bakken production increases as a result of the rig ramp up and the first new valhall well comes online.  fourth quarter production is forecast to average between 330,000 boepd and 340,000 boepd.
production variances related to 2016, 2015 and 2014 can be summarized as follows:
united states:  onshore crude oil production was lower in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to reduced drilling activity in the bakken shale play in response to low oil prices, while the increase in natural gas liquids production was primarily due to greater processed volumes at the tioga gas plant.  onshore natural gas production was higher in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a higher number of wells being on production in the utica shale play relative to the prior year.  total offshore production was lower in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to subsurface valve failures in three wells at the tubular bells field, a shut-in well to replace a subsurface valve at the conger field, extended planned shutdowns
30
on third-party hosted production facilities at the tubular bells and conger fields, and natural field decline.  onshore crude oil and natural gas liquids production was higher in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to continued drilling in the bakken oil shale play, while the increase in natural gas production was primarily attributable to the bakken and the utica shale.  offshore production increased in 2015 relative to 2014 as higher production from the tubular bells field, which came online in november 2014, was offset primarily by lower production from the llano, conger and shenzi fields.
europe:  crude oil production was lower in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to lower drilling activity, natural field decline and a planned shutdown at the valhall field, offshore norway.  crude oil and natural gas production was higher in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to less facility downtime and new wells at the valhall field in 2015.
africa:  crude oil production in africa was lower in 2016 compared to 2015, as a result of reduced drilling activity in equatorial guinea and the sale of our algeria asset in the fourth quarter of 2015, where net production for 2015 amounted to 7,000 boepd.  crude oil production in africa was lower in 2015 compared to 2014, due to libyan production being shut-in.  force majeure declared by the national oil company of libya was lifted in september 2016 and net production averaged 1,000 boepd in 2016.
asia:  natural gas production was lower in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to the planned shutdown of production facilities at the jda in 2016 to commission the booster compressor project and from lower production entitlement.  natural gas production was lower in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to asset sales partially offset by higher production at the jda as a result of higher facility uptime.
sales volumes:  the impact of lower sales volumes decreased after-tax results by approximately $540 million in 2016 compared to 2015.  our worldwide sales volumes were as follows:
2016                  2015                  2014

cost of products sold:  cost of products sold is mainly comprised of costs relating to the purchases of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas from our partners in hess operated wells or other third-parties, as well as rail transportation fees from our bakken midstream operating segment.  the decrease in cost of products sold in 2016 compared to 2015, and in 2015 compared to 2014, principally reflects the decline in crude oil prices.
cash operating costs:  cash operating costs, consisting of operating costs and expenses, production and severance taxes and e&p general and administrative expenses, decreased by $194 million in 2016 compared with the prior year (2015: $188 million decrease versus 2014).  the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 is due to lower production and ongoing cost reduction efforts, and lower production taxes in the bakken.  operating costs in 2016 include higher workover costs to replace failed subsurface valves in the gulf of mexico.  the decrease in 2015 compared to 2014 is due to cost reductions across the portfolio and lower production taxes in the bakken, which were partially offset by higher operating costs at tubular bells where production commenced in the fourth quarter of 2014.
bakken midstream tariffs expense:  tariffs expense in 2016 increased versus 2015 primarily due to increased oil gathering tariffs and minimum volume deficiency payments related to rail export services in 2016, partially offset by lower gas volumes processed through the tioga gas plant.  higher tariff expense in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily reflects higher volumes processed through the tioga gas plant which was shut down during the first quarter of 2014 to complete a plant expansion and refurbishment project.  for 2017, we estimate midstream tariffs expense, which will include tariffs associated with our interests in a permian gas plant in west texas and related co2 assets and water handling assets in north dakota, to be in the range of $520 million to $550 million.
depreciation, depletion and amortization:  depreciation, depletion and amortization (dd&a) costs decreased by $720 million in 2016 from 2015.  the decrease resulted from lower production and an improved portfolio average dd&a rate due to the production mix.  higher production in 2015 from the bakken, tubular bells and utica fields, which had higher dd&a rates per barrel than the portfolio average, were the primarily drivers for the increase in dd&a costs in 2015 compared to 2014.

$1,442              $881              $840
exploration expenses were higher in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to higher dry hole expense partially offset by lower leasehold impairment expense, geologic and seismic costs, and employee expenses. exploration expenses were higher in 2015 compared to 2014 due to higher dry hole costs, partially offset by lower leasehold impairment expense, geologic and seismic costs, and employee expenses.  see items affecting comparability of earnings between periods described below.  for 2017, we estimate exploration expenses, excluding dry hole expense, to be in the range of $250 million to $270 million.
income taxes:  the e&p income tax provision was an expense of $1,588 million in 2016, a benefit of $1,111 million in 2015 and an expense of $989 million in 2014.  the income tax expense recognized in 2016, despite pre-tax losses, is the result of deferred income tax charges to establish valuation allowances on net deferred tax assets.  excluding the impact of these charges and other items affecting comparability of earnings between periods provided below and libya, the effective income tax rates for e&p operations amounted to a benefit of 42% in 2016 (2015: 46% benefit; 2014: 37% charge).  based on current strip crude oil prices, we are forecasting a pre-tax loss for 2017.  the e&p effective tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods and libyan operations, is expected to be a benefit in the range of 17% to 21%, which is lower than the comparable effective tax rate in 2016 due to our not recognizing a deferred tax benefit or expense commencing in 2017 in the u.s., denmark (hydrocarbon tax only), and malaysia until such time that deferred tax assets are re-established in these jurisdictions.  see e&p items affecting comparability of earnings below and critical accounting policies and estimates - income taxes on page 42.

(a)   the partnership is not subject to tax and, therefore, the noncontrolling interest's share of net income is a pre-tax amount.

total revenues and non-operating income in 2016 decreased from 2015, primarily as a result of lower rail export revenue associated with third-party rail charges, partially offset by recognition of deferred minimum volume deficiency payments earned.  total revenues and non-operating income in 2015 improved from 2014 mainly due to higher throughput volumes at the tioga gas plant.
34
operating costs and expenses were lower in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a decrease in third-party rail charges.  operating costs and expenses were higher in 2015 compared to 2014 mainly due to an increase in third‐party operating and maintenance expense.  dd&a expenses were higher in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to capital expenditures on gathering pipelines and railcars that were placed in service.  dd&a expenses were higher in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to a full year's usage of the tioga gas plant in 2015, which was shut down during the first quarter of 2014 in connection with a large-scale expansion, refurbishment and optimization project.
the increase in interest expense in 2016 and 2015 reflects borrowings by hess infrastructure partners lp subsequent to its formation on july 1, 2015.
for 2017, we estimate net income attributable to hess corporation from the midstream segment, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, to be in the range of $70 million to $90 million.  in 2017, the midstream segment will include our interests in a permian gas plant in west texas and related co2 assets, and water handling assets in north dakota in addition to assets that comprise our current bakken midstream segment.
items affecting comparability of earnings between periods:  bakken midstream 2016 results included a pre-tax charge of $67 million ($21 million after income taxes and noncontrolling interest) to impair older specification rail cars.

corporate and other expenses, excluding items affecting comparability, were lower in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to reductions in employee costs, professional fees, and other general and administrative expenses, and the benefit of higher interest income and non-operating income.  corporate and other expenses for 2014 include a pre-tax gain of $13 million ($8 million after income taxes) related to the disposition of our 50% interest in a joint venture involved in the construction of an electric generating facility in newark, new jersey.  excluding the gain, 2015 costs are down compared to 2014 primarily due to lower employee costs and other expenses.  in 2017 pre-tax corporate expenses, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, are estimated to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million.
interest expense was comparable in 2016 compared to 2015, but capitalized interest expense increased over the same period with 2016 reflecting increased activity at the hess operated stampede development project.  interest expense was lower in 2015 compared to 2014, as lower interest rates offset higher average borrowings.  capitalized interest was also lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the cessation of capitalized interest on the tubular bells field upon first production in the fourth quarter of 2014.  in 2017 pre-tax interest expense, net is estimated to be in the range of $295 million to $305 million.
items affecting comparability of earnings between periods:  corporate, interest and other results included the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes:
2016:
•   income tax: we recorded a non-cash charge of $829 million to establish valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2016, as required under application of the accounting standards following a three-year cumulative loss. this deferred tax charge has no cash flow impact and the corporation's underlying tax position remains unchanged.

•   loss on debt extinguishment: we recorded a pre-tax charge of $148 million ($92 million after income taxes) related to the repurchase and redemption of notes to complete a debt refinancing. see note 12, debt, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

35
•   exit costs and other: we recorded pre-tax exit and other costs of $3 million ($2 million after income taxes), which primarily relates to employee severance.

2015:
•   hovensa llc: we recorded a pre-tax charge of $76 million ($49 million after income taxes) associated with debtor-in-possession financing provided to hovensa llc and the estimated liability resulting from its bankruptcy resolution.

2014:
•   impairment: we recorded a pre-tax charge of $84 million ($52 million after income taxes) to reduce the carrying value of our equity investment in the bayonne energy center to fair value.

•   other: we incurred severance charges of $19 million pre-tax ($12 million after income taxes) and exit related costs of $15 million pre-tax ($10 million after income taxes).

discontinued operations - items affecting comparability of earnings between periods discontinued operations attributable to hess corporation incurred a net loss of $48 million in 2015 compared to a net income of $625 million in 2014.  discontinued operations included ownership of an energy trading partnership through february 2015 and retail marketing through september 2014.
in september 2014, we completed the sale of our retail business for cash proceeds of approximately $2.8 billion.  this transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $954 million ($602 million after income taxes).  during 2014, we recorded pre-tax gains of $275 million ($171 million after income taxes) relating to the liquidation of last-in, first-out (lifo) inventories associated with the divested downstream operations.  in addition, we recorded pre-tax charges totaling $308 million ($202 million after income taxes) in 2014 for impairments, environmental matters, severance and exit related activities associated with the divestiture of downstream operations.  we also recognized in 2014 a pre-tax charge of $115 million ($72 million after income taxes) related to the termination of lease contracts and the purchase of 180 retail gasoline stations in preparation for the sale of the retail operations.

operating activities:  net cash provided by operating activities was $795 million in 2016, $1,981 million in 2015 and $4,457 million in 2014, primarily reflecting declining benchmark crude oil prices and changes in production volumes.
investing activities:  the decrease in additions to property, plant and equipment in 2016, as compared to 2015, is primarily due to reduced drilling activity (bakken, utica, norway, denmark and equatorial guinea) and reduced development expenditures (tubular bells, north malay basin and the jda).  the decrease in additions to property, plant and equipment in 2015, as compared to 2014, is primarily due to reduced drilling activity (bakken, utica, norway and equatorial guinea), reduced development expenditures at tubular bells and the jda, and lower exploratory drilling activity (ghana and kurdistan).  these reductions were offset by 2015 activity related to development activities at stampede in the gulf of mexico and exploration drilling activity in the gulf of mexico and guyana, and full field development at north malay basin.
total proceeds from the sale of assets related to continuing operations amounted to $140 million in 2016 (2015: $50 million; 2014: $2,978 million).  in 2014, we completed asset sales of our dry gas acreage in the utica shale play, our assets in thailand, the pangkah field, offshore indonesia, and our interests in two power plant joint ventures.  in 2014, net cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations included proceeds of $2.8 billion from the sale of the retail business.  in addition, we acquired our partners' 56% interest in wilcohess, a retail gasoline joint venture, for approximately $290 million and we incurred capital expenditures of $105 million related to the acquisition of previously leased retail gasoline stations.
financing activities:  in 2016, total borrowings were $1.54 billion and total repayments of debt were $1.46 billion.  in the first quarter of 2016, we issued 28,750,000 shares of common stock and depositary shares representing 575,000 shares of 8% series a mandatory convertible preferred stock for total net proceeds of $1.64 billion.  in 2015, we received net cash consideration of approximately $2.6 billion from the sale of a 50% interest in our bakken midstream business.  upon formation of the joint venture, hip issued $600 million of debt under a term loan a facility.  the proceeds from the debt were distributed equally to the partners.  we purchased common stock under our $6.5 billion board authorized stock repurchase plan of $142 million in 2015 and $3,715 million in 2014.  common and preferred stock dividends paid were $350 million in 2016 (2015: $287 million; 2014: $303 million).
37
future capital requirements and resources at december 31, 2016, we had $2.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and total liquidity, including available committed credit facilities, of approximately $7.3 billion. cash and cash equivalents held outside of the u.s., which we have the ability to repatriate without triggering a u.s. cash tax liability, amounted to $287 million at december 31, 2016.
net production in 2017 is forecast to be in the range of 300,000 boepd to 310,000 boepd, excluding any contribution from libya and we expect our 2017 e&p capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately $2.25 billion.  based on current forward strip crude oil prices for 2017, which are higher than 2016 prices, we forecast a smaller net loss and net operating cash flow deficit (including capital expenditures) in 2017 compared to 2016.  we expect to fund our projected net operating cash flow deficit (including capital expenditures) through 2017 with cash on hand.  due to the low commodity price environment, we may take any of the following steps, or a combination thereof, to improve our liquidity and financial position: further reduce our planned capital program and other cash outlays, borrow from our committed credit facilities, issue debt or equity securities, and pursue asset sales.

hess corporation has a $4.0 billion syndicated revolving credit facility expiring in january 2020.  borrowings on the facility will generally bear interest at 1.3% above the london interbank offered rate (libor). the interest rate will be higher if our credit rating is lowered.  the facility contains a financial covenant that limits the amount of the total borrowings on the last day of each fiscal quarter to 65% of the corporation's total capitalization, defined as total debt plus stockholders' equity.  as of december 31, 2016, hess corporation had no outstanding borrowings under this facility and was in compliance with this financial covenant.
we had $188 million in letters of credit outstanding at december 31, 2016 (2015: $113 million), which primarily relate to our international operations.  see also note 24, financial risk management activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
hip has a $400 million 5-year syndicated revolving credit facility, which can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to fund the joint venture's operating activities and capital expenditures.  borrowings generally bear interest at the libor plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.10% to 1.70%.  the interest rate is subject to adjustment based on hip's leverage ratio, which is calculated as total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda).  if hip obtains credit ratings, pricing levels will be based on the credit ratings in effect from time to time.  the credit facility contains financial covenants that generally require a leverage ratio of no more than 5.0 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters and an interest coverage ratio, which is calculated as ebitda to interest expense, of no less than 2.25 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters. hip is in compliance with these financial covenants at december 31, 2016.
at december 31, 2016, borrowings under hip's revolving credit facility, which are non-recourse to hess corporation, amounted to $153 million.  hip also has a five-year term loan a loan facility with outstanding borrowings of $585 million, excluding deferred issuance costs, which is also non-recourse to hess corporation.
we also have a shelf registration under which we may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock.

credit ratings two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating.  in february 2016, standard and poor's ratings services (s&p) lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to bbb- with stable outlook and moody's investors service (moody's) lowered our credit rating to ba1 with stable outlook, which is below investment grade.  in december 2016, fitch ratings (fitch) lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to bbb- with stable outlook.  in february 2017, s&p re-affirmed our investment grade credit rating of bbb- with stable outlook.  the consequence of lower credit ratings is an increase in interest rates and facility fees on our credit facilities and the potential for additional required collateral under operating agreements.  as of december 31, 2016, based on our current credit ratings, we may be required to issue additional collateral in the form of letters of credit up to approximately $270 million.  if fitch or s&p were to reduce their rating on our unsecured debt below investment grade, we estimate that we could be required to issue additional letters of credit up to $200 million as of december 31, 2016.

capital expenditures represent amounts that were contractually committed at december 31, 2016, including the portion of our planned capital expenditure program for 2017.  obligations for operating expenses include commitments for oil and gas production expenses, seismic purchases and other normal business expenses.  other liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2016, including pension plan liabilities and estimates for uncertain income tax positions.
the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries, lease drilling rigs, office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases.
off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2016, we have $27 million in letters of credit for which we are contingently liable.  see also note 21, guarantees, contingencies and commitments in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
foreign operations we conduct exploration and production activities outside the u.s., principally in europe (norway and denmark), africa (equatorial guinea, libya, and ghana), asia (joint development area of malaysia/thailand and malaysia), australia, south america (guyana and suriname) and canada.  therefore, we are subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, corruption, acts of terrorism, tax law changes and currency risk.  see item 1a. risk factors for further details.

critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income.  the accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios.  however, our accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity.
accounting for exploration and development costs:  e&p activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method.  costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers' fees and other related costs are capitalized.  annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred.  costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized.  in production operations, costs of injected co2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred.
the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found.  exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project.  if either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense.  indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves, and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors.
crude oil and natural gas reserves:  the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities.  the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill.
for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations.  in addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project.  we maintain our own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties.  our technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies.  to provide consistency throughout the corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used.  the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review.  we also engage an independent third-party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of our total proved reserves each year.
proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve-month period ending december 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, excluding escalations based on future conditions.  as discussed in item 1a. risk factors, crude oil prices are volatile which can have an impact on our proved reserves.  for example, the average wti crude oil price used in the determination of proved reserves at december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $42.68, $50.13, and $94.42 per barrel, respectively.  the lower prices for 2016 and 2015 relative to 2014 resulted in negative revisions to our proved reserves at december 31, 2016 of 29 million boe (2015: 234 million boe).  if crude oil prices in 2017 are at levels below that used in determining 2016 proved reserves, we may recognize further negative revisions to our december 31, 2016 proved undeveloped reserves.  in addition, we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves, which can vary significantly by asset due to differing operating cost structures.  conversely, price increases in 2017 above those used in determining 2016 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at december 31, 2017.  it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves as of december 31, 2017, due to a number of factors that are currently unknown, including 2017 crude oil prices, any revisions based on 2017 reservoir performance, and the levels to which industry costs will change in response to movements in commodity prices.  a 10% change in proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at december 31, 2016 would result in an approximate $300 million pre-tax change in depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense for 2017.  see the supplementary oil and gas data on pages 84 through 94 in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our oil and gas reserves.
bakken midstream joint venture:  on july 1, 2015, we sold a 50% interest in hip to gip for net cash consideration of approximately $2.6 billion.  we consolidate the activities of hip, which qualifies as a variable interest entity (vie) under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.  we have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the vie, as defined in the accounting standards, since we have the power through our 50% ownership to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of hip, and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to hip.  this conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered hip's
40
governance structure, the commercial agreements between hip and us, and the voting rights established between the members which provide us the ability to control the operations of hip.
impairment of long-lived assets:  we review long‐lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered.  long‐lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  if the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded.  the amount of impairment is determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows, an income valuation approach, or by a market‐based valuation approach, which are level 3 fair value measurements.
in the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management's best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate.  the projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures.  the production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information.  oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve-month average prices.
our impairment tests of long‐lived e&p producing assets are based on our best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed.  we could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly.  as a result of the extended period of low crude oil prices, we tested our oil and gas properties for impairment.  see note 6, impairment in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
impairment of goodwill:  goodwill is tested for impairment annually on october 1st or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable based on a two-step process.  the goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level, which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment.  the reporting unit or units to be used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors, including the manner in which the business is managed.  prior to the second quarter of 2015, we had one operating segment, e&p consisting of two reporting units, offshore and onshore which reflected the manner in which performance was assessed by the operating segment manager. in the second quarter of 2015 we established a second operating segment, bakken midstream, which previously was part of the onshore reporting unit.  prior to the formation of the bakken midstream operating segment the offshore reporting unit had allocated goodwill of $1,098 million while the onshore reporting unit had allocated goodwill of $760 million.  upon formation of the bakken midstream operating segment, we allocated $375 million of goodwill from the onshore reporting unit to the bakken midstream operating segment based on the relative fair values of the bakken midstream business and the remainder of the onshore reporting unit.  there was no change to the composition of the offshore reporting unit.
in step one of the impairment test, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount, including goodwill.  if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired.  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we perform step two to determine possible impairment by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount.  the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assuming the reporting unit is purchased at fair value with assets and liabilities of the reporting unit being reflected at fair value in the same manner as the accounting prescribed for a business combination.  the resulting excess of fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the reporting unit's assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill.  if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss would be recorded.
our fair value estimate of each reporting unit is the sum of the anticipated discounted cash flows of producing assets and known development projects and an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control and increased market share.  the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums.  we also consider the relative market valuation of similar peer companies, and other market data if available, in determining fair value of a reporting unit.  in addition, a qualitative reconciliation of our market capitalization to the fair value of the reporting units used in the goodwill impairment test is performed as of the testing date to assess reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values.
significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of a reporting unit that could result in failing step one and potentially result in an impairment of goodwill based on the outcome of step two.  if a reporting unit fails step one, it is possible that the implied fair value of goodwill in step two exceeds its carrying value due to one or more assets of the reporting unit having a fair value below its carrying value.
41
as there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned at the reporting unit level or there could be an impairment of goodwill without a corresponding impairment of an underlying asset.
in the second quarter of 2015, we performed impairment tests on the offshore and onshore reporting units in accordance with accounting standards for goodwill immediately prior to creation of the bakken midstream operating segment.  no impairment resulted from this assessment.  in addition, accounting standards require that following a reorganization, allocated goodwill should be tested for impairment.  we also performed impairment tests on the allocated goodwill for the bakken midstream and the onshore reporting unit at june 30, 2015.  goodwill allocated to the bakken midstream operating segment passed the impairment test but the goodwill allocated to the onshore reporting unit did not pass the impairment test.  as a result, we recorded a noncash pre-tax charge of $385 million ($385 million after income taxes) in the second quarter of 2015 to reflect the onshore reporting unit's goodwill at its implied fair value of zero based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation as stipulated in the accounting standards.
as a result of the decline in crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed an impairment test at december 31, 2015 on the offshore reporting unit and determined its goodwill was impaired.  we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $1,098 million ($1,098 million after income taxes) to reflect the offshore reporting unit's goodwill at its implied fair value of zero based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation as stipulated in the accounting standards.
effective january 1, 2017, as part of a reorganization of our e&p business, the onshore and offshore reporting units were combined within the e&p operating segment, which had no goodwill at december 31, 2016.  this reorganization had no impact on the composition of the bakken midstream operating segment.  we expect that the benefits of our remaining goodwill totaling $375 million assigned to the bakken midstream operating segment will be recovered based on market conditions at december 31, 2016.
income taxes:  judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements.  these judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination.
we have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits.  additionally, we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities.  regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. if, when tested under the relevant accounting standards, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized.
the accounting standards require the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence giving weight based on the evidence's relative objectivity.  in evaluating potential sources of positive evidence, we consider the reversal of taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback and carryforward periods, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets, estimates of future taxable income, and other factors.  estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves, selling prices, and other subjective operating assumptions that are consistent with internal business forecasts.  in evaluating potential sources of negative evidence, we consider a cumulative loss in recent years, any history of operating losses or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused, losses expected in early future years, unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis in future years, and carryback or carryforward periods that are so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits if a significant deductible temporary difference is expected to reverse in a single year.  due to a sustained low commodity price environment we experienced a three-year cumulative consolidated loss as of december 31, 2016. a three-year cumulative consolidated loss constitutes objective negative evidence to which the accounting standards require we assign significant weight relative to subjective evidence such as our estimates of future taxable income.
as of december 31, 2016, the consolidated balance sheet reflects a $5,450 million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for multiple jurisdictions based on the evaluation of the accounting standards described above, with $3,749 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 related primarily to the u.s., denmark (hydrocarbon tax only), and malaysia.  the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income change or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as expected future growth.  we do not provide for deferred u.s. income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.
asset retirement obligations:  we have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‐lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations.  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations.  in addition, the fair value of any
42
legally required conditional asset retirement obligation is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated.  we capitalize such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred.  in subsequent periods, the liability is accreted, and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.  in order to measure these obligations, we estimate the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations.  in determining these estimates, we are required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate.  in addition, there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology.  as a result, our estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above.  changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values.
retirement plans:  we have funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded postretirement medical plan.  we recognize the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans in the consolidated balance sheet.
the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; expected long‐term rates of return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels, and participant mortality assumptions.  these assumptions represent estimates made by us, some of which can be affected by external factors.  for example, the discount rate used to estimate our projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high‐quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations, while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category.  changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in our financial statements.
derivatives:  we utilize derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates.
all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet.  our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative.  the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings.  derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges).  the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss).  amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings.  changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings.  the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings.
fair value measurements:  we use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments, including the market and income approaches.  our fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations.  counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and our credit is considered for accrued liabilities.
we also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles.  these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, qualifying non-monetary exchanges, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long-lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill.
we determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (level 3), including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data.  measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2.
when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market, those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market.  multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value; however, the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy.

environment, health and safety our long term vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting high standards of corporate citizenship and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business.  our strategy is reflected in our environment, health, safety and social responsibility (ehs & sr) policies and by a management system framework that helps protect our workforce, customers and local communities.  our management systems are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in ehs & sr performance.  improved performance may, in the short‐term, increase our operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate.  in addition to enhanced ehs & sr performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized from investments in ehs & sr.  we have programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate ehs & sr goals and objectives.
we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern.  we assess, monitor and take measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations.  we are committed to complying with all greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions mandates and the responsible management of ghg emissions at our facilities.
we will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation.  sites where corrective action may be necessary include onshore exploration and production facilities, sites from discontinued operations as to which we retained liability and, although not currently significant, "superfund" sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party.
we accrue for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable.  at december 31, 2016, our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $80 million.  we expect that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites.  our remediation spending was approximately $10 million in 2016 (2015: $13 million; 2014: $12 million).  the level of other expenditures to comply with federal, state, local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses.

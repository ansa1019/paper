                                                       otherthe other segment consists primarily of general corporate overhead expenses, the corporate strategy and creative group and costs related to the u.k. newspaper matters (as defined in item 1a. risk factors). the companys corporate strategy and creative group was formed to identify new products and services across its businesses to increase revenues and profitability and to target and assess potential acquisitions and investments.

news and information services revenue at the news and information services segment is derived from the sale of advertising, circulation and subscriptions, as well as licensing. adverse changes in general market conditions for advertising continue to affect revenues. advertising revenues at the news and information services segment are also subject to seasonality, with revenues typically being highest in the companys second fiscal quarter due to the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies. circulation and subscription revenues can be greatly affected by changes in the prices of the companys and/or competitors products, as well as by promotional activities.
operating expenses include costs related to paper, production, distribution, third party printing, editorial and commissions. selling, general and administrative expenses include promotional expenses, salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead.
the news and information services segments advertising volume, circulation and the price of paper are the key variables whose fluctuations can have a material effect on the companys operating results and cash flow. the company has to anticipate the level of advertising volume, circulation and paper prices in managing its businesses to maximize operating profit during expanding and contracting economic cycles. the company continues to be exposed to risks associated with paper used for printing. paper is a basic commodity and its price is sensitive to the balance of supply and demand. the companys expenses are affected by the cyclical increases and decreases in the price of paper. the news and information services segments products compete for readership and advertising with local and national competitors and also compete with other media alternatives in their respective markets. competition for circulation and subscriptions is based on the content of the products provided, pricing and, from time to time, various promotions. the success of these products also depends upon advertisers judgments as to the most effective use of their advertising budgets. competition for advertising is based upon the reach of the products, advertising rates and advertiser results. such judgments are based on factors such as cost, availability of alternative media, distribution and quality of readership demographics.
the companys traditional print business faces challenges from alternative media formats and shifting consumer preferences. the company is also exposed to the impact of long-term structural movements in advertising spending, in particular, the move in advertising from print to digital. these alternative media formats could impact the companys overall performance, positively or negatively. in addition, technologies have been and will continue to be developed that allow users to block advertising on websites and mobile devices, which may impact advertising rates or revenues.
as a multi-platform news provider, the company recognizes the importance of maximizing revenues from a variety of media formats and platforms, both in terms of paid-for content and in new advertising models, and continues to invest in its digital products. technologies such as smartphones, tablets and similar devices and their related applications provide continued opportunities for the company to make its journalism available to a new audience of readers, introduce new or different pricing schemes, and develop its products to continue to attract advertisers and/or affect the relationship between publisher and consumer. the company continues to develop and implement strategies to exploit its content across a variety of media channels and platforms.
40
book publishing the book publishing segment derives revenues from the sale of general fiction, nonfiction, childrens and religious books in the u.s. and internationally. the revenues and operating results of the book publishing segment are significantly affected by the timing of releases and the number of its books in the marketplace. the book publishing marketplace is subject to increased periods of demand during the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies. this marketplace is highly competitive and continues to change due to technological developments and other factors. each book is a separate and distinct product, and its financial success depends upon many factors, including public acceptance.
major new title releases represent a significant portion of the book publishing segments sales throughout the fiscal year. print-based consumer books are generally sold on a fully returnable basis, resulting in the return of unsold books. in the domestic and international markets, the book publishing segment is subject to global trends and local economic conditions. operating expenses for the book publishing segment include costs related to paper, printing, authors royalties, editorial, promotional, art and design expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead.
digital real estate services the digital real estate services segment sells online advertising services on its residential real estate and commercial property sites and also licenses certain professional software products on a subscription basis. significant expenses associated with these sites and software solutions include development costs, advertising and promotional expenses, hosting and support services, salaries, employee benefits and other routine overhead expenses.
consumers are increasingly turning to the internet and mobile devices for real estate information. the digital real estate services segments success depends on its continued innovation to provide products and services that make its websites and mobile applications useful for consumers and real estate and mortgage professionals and attractive to its advertisers.
cable network programming the cable network programming segment consists of fox sports australia, which offers the following seven channels in high definition: fox sports 1, fox sports 2, fox sports 3, fox sports 4, fox sports 5, fox footy and fox sports news. revenue is primarily derived from monthly affiliate fees received from pay-tv providers (mainly foxtel) based on the number of subscribers.
fox sports australia competes primarily with espn, bein sports, the free-to-air (fta) channels and certain telecommunications companies in australia.
the most significant operating expenses of the cable network programming segment are the acquisition and production expenses related to programming and the expenses related to operating the technical facilities of the broadcast operations. the expenses associated with licensing programming rights are recognized during the applicable season or event, which can cause results at the cable network programming segment to fluctuate based on the timing and mix of the companys local and international sports programming. other expenses include marketing and promotional expenses related to improving the market visibility and awareness of the channels and their programming. additional expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead expenses.
other the other segment primarily consists of general corporate overhead expenses, the corporate strategy and creative group and costs related to the u.k. newspaper matters. the companys corporate strategy and creative group was formed to identify new products and services across the companys businesses to increase revenues and profitability and to target and assess potential acquisitions and investments.

revenuesrevenues decreased $232 million, or 3%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. the revenue decrease was mainly due to a decrease in revenues at the news and information services segment of $393 million, primarily resulting from the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, weakness in the print advertising market and lower free-standing insert product revenues at news america marketing. the revenue decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenues at the digital real estate services segment of $197 million, primarily as a result of the acquisition of move in november 2014 and increased revenues at rea group. the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016 resulted in a revenue increase of approximately $112 million. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of $455 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.
operating expensesoperating expenses decreased $224 million, or 5%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. the decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to a decrease in operating expenses at the news and information services segment of $300 million, primarily as a result of the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, lower newsprint, production and distribution costs and the impact of cost savings initiatives. the decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by higher operating expenses at the digital real estate services segment due to the acquisition of move in november 2014 and at the book publishing segment primarily due to higher costs associated with increased print book sales. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in an operating expense decrease of $199 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.
45
selling, general and administrative expensesselling, general and administrative expenses increased $95 million, or 4%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher expenses at the digital real estate services segment as a result of the acquisition of move in november 2014 and increased costs in the news and information services segment. the increases at the news and information services segment were primarily related to the acquisition of unruly in september 2015 and checkout 51 in july 2015 as well as increased brand marketing and promotional expenses at the u.k. newspapers. these increases were partially offset by the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a selling, general and administrative expense decrease of $186 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.
nam group and zillow settlements, netduring the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, the company recognized one-time costs of approximately $280 million in connection with the settlement of certain litigation and related claims at news america marketing. in addition, in the three months ended june 30, 2016, the company recognized a gain of $122 million in connection with the settlement of litigation with zillow, inc. (zillow), which reflects settlement proceeds received from zillow of $130 million, less $8 million paid to the national association of realtors® (nar). (see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements).
depreciation and amortizationdepreciation and amortization expense increased $7 million, or 1%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization expense at the digital real estate services segment due to the acquisition of move in november 2014, partially offset by the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a depreciation and amortization expense decrease of $27 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.

(see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements).

for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, foxtel revenues decreased $279 million, or 10%, as a result of the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which more than offset higher revenues in local currency. operating income decreased primarily due to the negative net impact of foreign currency fluctuations,

increased investment in programming to support subscriber growth, higher offer costs and continued investment in presto, partially offset by lower depreciation expense resulting from foxtels reassessment of the useful lives of cable and satellite installations. net income decreased as a result of the lower operating income noted above, partially offset by lower income tax expense.

(see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).

(b)                                                     the company recorded write-offs and impairments of certain investments in the fiscal years ended june 30, 2016 and 2015. these write-offs and impairments were taken either as a result of the deteriorating financial position of the investee or due to an other-than-temporary impairment resulting from sustained losses and limited prospects for recovery. (see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.)

(c)                             in august 2014, rea group completed the sale of a minority interest held in marketable securities for total cash consideration of $104 million. as a result of the sale, rea group recognized a pre-tax gain of $29 million, which was reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and included in other, net in the statement of operations.

income tax benefit (expense)the companys income tax benefit and effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 were $54 million and (30%), respectively, as compared to an income tax expense and effective tax rate of $185 million and 34%, respectively, for fiscal 2015.
for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2016 the company recorded a tax benefit of $54 million on pre-tax income of $181 million resulting in an effective tax rate that was lower than the u.s. statutory tax. the lower tax rate was primarily due to a tax benefit of approximately $106 million related to the release of previously established valuation allowances related to certain u.s. federal net operating losses and state deferred tax assets. this benefit was recognized in conjunction with managements plan to dispose of the companys digital education business in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, as the company now expects to generate sufficient u.s. taxable income to utilize these deferred tax assets prior to expiration. in addition, the effective tax rate was also impacted by the $29 million non-taxable gain resulting from the revaluation of rea groups previously held equity interest in iproperty.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, the companys effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. statutory tax rate primarily due to the impact from foreign operations which are subject to lower tax rates, partially offset by the impact of nondeductible items and changes in our accrued liabilities for uncertain tax positions. (see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements).
47
income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxfor the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, the company recorded income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $15 million as compared to a loss of $445 million for fiscal 2015. the income recognized in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the impact of a $144 million tax benefit recognized upon reclassification of the digital education segment to discontinued operations, a tax benefit of $30 million related to the current year operations and lower operating losses as a result of the sale of amplify insight and amplify learning, which more than offset the pre-tax non-cash impairment charge recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 of $76 million and $17 million in severance and lease termination charges recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. the loss recognized in fiscal 2015 primarily relates to a non-cash impairment charge of $371 million recorded in the three months ended june 30, 2015 and a full year of operating losses at amplify in 2015. (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
net income (loss)net income increased $328 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher income from discontinued operations and the income tax benefit discussed above, partially offset by the negative net impact of the nam group and zillow legal settlements, lower total segment ebitda, the lower contribution from other, net, lower equity earnings, primarily from foxtel, and lower interest, net.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interestsnet income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by $2 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, due to higher results at rea group, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations.
segment analysis segment ebitda is defined as revenues less operating expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses and excluding the impact from the nam group and zillow legal settlements. segment ebitda does not include: depreciation and amortization, impairment and restructuring charges, equity earnings of affiliates, interest, net, other, net, income tax benefit (expense) and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. segment ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of segment ebitda.
segment ebitda is the primary measure used by the companys chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources within the companys businesses. segment ebitda provides management, investors and equity analysts with a measure to analyze the operating performance of each of the companys business segments and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors data, although historical results may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences). the company believes that information about segment ebitda allows users of its consolidated financial statements to evaluate changes in the operating results of the companys portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net income (loss), thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results.
48
total segment ebitda is a non-gaap measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss), cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap. in addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment and restructuring charges, which are significant components in assessing the companys financial performance. the following table reconciles total segment ebitda to income from continuing operations.

for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, revenues at the news and information services segment decreased $393 million, or 7%, as compared to fiscal 2015. the revenue decrease was mainly due to lower advertising revenues of $353 million as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily resulting from the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, weakness in the print advertising market and lower free-standing insert product revenues at news america marketing. circulation and subscription revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 decreased $52 million as compared to fiscal 2015 due to the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations of $109 million, which more than offset higher paid circulation and subscription revenues at dow jones and the australian newspapers resulting from price increases and digital subscriber growth. other revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 increased $12 million as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to the $45 million contribution from unruly which was acquired in september 2015, partially offset by lower other revenues at the u.k. newspapers and the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016 resulted in a revenue increase of approximately $77 million.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, segment ebitda at the news and information services segment decreased $389 million, or 65%, as compared to fiscal 2015. the decrease was primarily due to one-time costs of approximately $280 million recognized in connection with the settlement of certain litigation and related claims, lower free-standing insert product revenues and a loss of $20 million at checkout 51, primarily related to investment spending and acquisition-related costs. segment ebitda was also impacted by a decrease of $27 million at the australian newspapers, primarily resulting from the negative net impact of foreign currency fluctuations and lower advertising revenues, which more than offset the impact of lower newsprint, production and distribution costs, and at the u.k. newspapers of $23 million, primarily due to lower revenues and higher promotion and marketing costs. these decreases were partially offset by an increase of $22 million at dow jones, primarily due to lower newsprint, production and distribution costs and the impact of cost savings initiatives.
news corp australia revenues at the australian newspapers for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 decreased 16% compared to fiscal 2015, with the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against the australian dollar resulting in a revenue decrease of $194 million, or 13%. advertising revenues declined $203 million, primarily as a result of the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and weakness in the print advertising market in australia. circulation and subscription revenues declined $43 million due to the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, as price increases, digital subscriber growth and the positive impact of the 53rd week more than offset print volume declines.

dow jones revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 were relatively flat as compared to fiscal 2015. circulation and subscription revenues increased by $33 million, primarily due to price increases and digital volume growth at the wall street journal, modest growth in subscription revenues in the professional information business and the positive impact of the 53rd week, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. this increase was partially offset by lower advertising revenues of $27 million as a result of lower print advertising, partially offset by higher digital advertising revenues and the positive impact of the 53rd week. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of $10 million, or 1%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.

for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, revenues at the book publishing segment decreased $21 million, or 1%, as compared to fiscal 2015. the decrease was primarily the result of $69 million in higher sales of the divergent series by veronica roth and american sniper by chris kyle in the prior year, an industry-wide decline in e-book sales and the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. these decreases were partially offset by higher print book sales across all genres, including sales of go set a watchman by harper lee in fiscal 2016 of $42 million, and $23 million related to the acquisition of harlequin in august 2014. the company sold 2.0 million net units of the divergent series in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to 8.3 million net units in fiscal 2015. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of $39 million, or 2%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to

for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, revenues at the digital real estate services segment increased $197 million, or 32%, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to a $169 million increase from move which was acquired in november 2014. the majority of the increase related to the inclusion of a full year of operations in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. approximately $40 million of the increase related to move was driven by increased connectionsm for co-brokerage product revenues and to a lesser extent, non-listing media revenues in the period from november 2015 through the end of fiscal 2016, as compared to the comparable prior year period. at rea group, a 5% increase in revenues resulting from higher revenues from greater residential listing depth product penetration and higher developer and media revenues was largely offset by the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of $66 million, or 10%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, segment ebitda at the digital real estate services segment increased $143 million, or 71%, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to an increase at move resulting from a gain of $122 million recognized in connection with the settlement of litigation with zillow. the gain reflects proceeds received from zillow of $130 million, less $8 million paid to nar. the results at move were also positively impacted by transaction costs of $19 million in fiscal 2015 which did not recur in the current fiscal year and higher revenues, offset by increased legal costs of $28 million related to the zillow litigation. total legal costs incurred in connection with the zillow litigation were $38 million for fiscal 2016. segment ebitda was also impacted by higher revenues at rea group which were partially offset by the negative net impact of currency fluctuations. these increases were partially offset by $7 million in one-time transaction costs related to the acquisition of iproperty. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a segment ebitda decrease of $37 million, or 19%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.

for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, revenues and segment ebitda at the cable network programming segment decreased $16 million, or 3%, and $11 million, or 8%, respectively, as compared to fiscal 2015. the revenue decrease was primarily due to the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which more than offset higher affiliate and advertising revenues. the decrease in segment ebitda was primarily the result of higher programming rights and production costs related to the rugby world cup and the national rugby league simulcast rights, higher production costs for other sports programming and the negative net impact of foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by the absence of costs associated with the cricket world cup and asian cup which occurred during fiscal 2015 and the higher affiliate and advertising revenues noted above. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against the australian dollar resulted in a revenue decrease of $60 million, or 12%, and a segment ebitda decrease of $14 million, or 10%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016 resulted in a revenue increase of approximately $10 million.

revenuesrevenues increased $38 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. the revenue increase was primarily due to increased revenues at the book publishing segment of $233 million, primarily as a result of the acquisition of harlequin in august 2014, and increased revenues at the digital real estate services segment of $217 million, primarily as a result of the acquisition of move in november 2014, and to a lesser extent, increased revenues at rea group. these revenue increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenues at the news and information services segment of $422 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, primarily resulting from weakness in the print advertising market and the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by an increase in other revenues. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of $319 million for the fiscal year ended 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.
operating expensesoperating expenses decreased $122 million, or 2%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. the decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to lower operating expenses at the news and information services segment of $264 million due to lower production and distribution costs resulting from reduced sales, the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the impact of cost savings initiatives. the decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by higher operating expenses at the book publishing and digital real estate services segments, primarily due to the acquisitions of harlequin and move, respectively. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in an operating expense decrease of $143 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.
54
selling, general and administrative expensesselling, general and administrative expenses increased $178 million, or 7%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher expenses at the digital real estate services segment, primarily as a result of the acquisition of move, including one-time transaction costs associated with the acquisition of $19 million, higher expenses at the book publishing segment, primarily as a result of the acquisition of harlequin, increased legal costs of $20 million at news america marketing and the impact of dual rent and other facility related costs of $13 million. these increases were partially offset by the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the impact of cost savings initiatives. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a selling, general and administrative expense decrease of $127 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.
depreciation and amortizationdepreciation and amortization expense decreased $54 million, or 10%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to lower depreciation expense at the news and information services segment of $93 million, partially offset by increased depreciation at the digital real estate services segment and book publishing segment, primarily due to the acquisitions of move and harlequin, respectively. depreciation and amortization in fiscal 2014 included approximately $30 million related to accelerated depreciation at the u.k. newspapers as a result of changes in the useful lives of leased facilities that the company exited in fiscal 2014. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a depreciation and amortization expense decrease of $22 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.
impairment and restructuring chargesin fiscal 2015, the company recorded restructuring charges of $84 million, of which $75 million related to the news and information services segment. the restructuring charges were primarily related to employee termination benefits.
in fiscal 2014, the company recorded impairment charges of $15 million, primarily related to the sale of a u.s. printing facility. in fiscal 2014, the company recorded restructuring charges of $79 million, of which $67 million related to the news and information services segment. the restructuring charges were primarily related to employee termination benefits.

income tax (expense) benefitthe companys income tax expense and effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 were $185 million and 34%, respectively, as compared to an income tax benefit and effective tax rate of $614 million and 345%, respectively, for fiscal 2014.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, the companys effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. statutory tax rate primarily due to the impact from foreign operations which are subject to lower tax rates, partially offset by the impact of nondeductible items. (see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements).
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 the company recorded a tax benefit, net of applicable tax on interest, related to refunds received from a foreign jurisdiction which increased the effective tax rate by 405%. in
56
accordance with the terms of the tax sharing and indemnification agreement, the company paid the foreign tax refunds to 21st century fox and recorded an expense to other, net in the statements of operations.

loss from discontinued operations, net of taxfor the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, the company recorded a loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $445 million as compared to a loss of $142 million for fiscal 2014. the decrease was primarily due to a non-cash impairment charge of $371 million that was recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. as part of the companys long-range planning process, the company changed its strategy and related outlook with respect to the amplify reporting unit which resulted in a reduction in expected future cash flows for the business. as a result, the company determined that the fair value of this reporting unit declined below its carrying value. the charge primarily consisted of a write-down of the companys goodwill of $325 million and a write-down of capitalized software development costs of $45 million. (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
net (loss) incomenet income decreased $372 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. the decrease in net income was primarily related to lower income from discontinued operations resulting from the non-cash impairment charge recognized in the three months ended june 30, 2015, lower equity earnings, higher taxes as noted above and lower segment ebitda, partially offset by favorable depreciation expense.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interestsnet income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by $14 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, due to higher results at rea group.
segment analysis segment ebitda is defined as revenues less operating expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses and excluding the impact from the nam group and zillow legal settlements. segment ebitda does not include: depreciation and amortization, impairment and restructuring charges, equity earnings of affiliates, interest, net, other, net, income tax benefit (expense) and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. segment ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of segment ebitda.
segment ebitda is the primary measure used by the companys chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources within the companys businesses. segment ebitda provides management, investors and equity analysts with a measure to analyze the operating performance of each of the companys business segments and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors data, although historical results may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences). the company believes that information about segment ebitda allows users of its consolidated financial statements to evaluate changes in the operating results of the companys portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net income (loss), thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results.
57
total segment ebitda is a non-gaap measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net (loss) income, cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap. in addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment and restructuring charges, which are significant components in assessing the companys financial performance. the following table reconciles total segment ebitda to income from continuing operations.

for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, revenues at the news and information services segment decreased $422 million, or 7%, as compared to fiscal 2014. the revenue decrease was primarily due to lower advertising revenues of $366 million as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily resulting from lower print advertising revenues throughout the segment. circulation and subscription revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 decreased $86 million as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily as a result of the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. other revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 increased $30 million, primarily due to increased other revenues at news corp australia.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, segment ebitda at the news and information services segment decreased $62 million, or 9%, as compared to fiscal 2014. the decrease was primarily due to a decrease at news america marketing of $20 million, due to increased legal expenses of $20 million, as decreased advertising revenues were offset by lower operating costs, a decrease at dow jones of $16 million, primarily due to lower revenues, partially offset by lower expenses related to volume declines and the impact of cost savings initiatives, a decrease at the australian newspapers of $10 million due to the negative net impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which more than offset lower expenses and the impact of cost savings initiatives, and a decrease at the u.k. newspapers of $10 million. the decrease at the u.k. newspapers was principally as a result of lower revenues, the impact of dual rent and other facility related costs of $13 million, one-time expenses of $11 million related to the termination of a distribution contract in connection with continued cost reduction initiatives and the release of legal reserves resulting from a favorable arbitration ruling in the prior year period of $8 million, which more than offset costs savings initiatives and lower marketing costs.
news corp australia revenues at the australian newspapers for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 decreased 9% compared to fiscal 2014 with the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against the australian dollar resulting in a revenue decrease of $145 million, or 8%. revenues declined marginally in local currency. advertising revenues declined $153 million, primarily as a result of the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and weakness in the print advertising market in australia, partially offset by growth in digital revenues driven by news.com.au. circulation and subscription revenues declined $37 million due to the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations as price increases and growth in digital subscribers offset print volume declines. these decreases were partially offset by increased other revenues.
news uk for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, revenues at the u.k. newspapers decreased 7% as compared to fiscal 2014. the decrease was primarily due to lower advertising revenues of $82 million resulting from overall print market declines, primarily at the sun. circulation and subscription revenues decreased $18 million as single-copy volume declines at the sun and the sunday times and the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations more than offset the impact of price increases and print and digital subscriber growth. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against the british pound resulted in a revenue decrease of $45 million, or 3%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.
dow jones revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 were down 4% compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to lower revenues of $28 million resulting from the sale of the dow jones local media group in september 2013, lower advertising revenues of $21 million as a result of print advertising declines and lower circulation and subscription revenues of $18 million, primarily as a result of decreased professional information business revenues of $42 million, partially offset by increased circulation revenues of $24 million as a result of price increases at the wall street journal and wsj.com. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of $13 million, or 1%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015.

for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, revenues at the book publishing segment increased $233 million, or 16%, as compared to fiscal 2014. the increase was primarily the result of the acquisition of harlequin, which contributed $281 million of revenues during fiscal 2015. consumer revenues associated with print and digital book sales at harpercollins other divisions decreased $44 million, as increased backlist sales in the general and childrens books categories, notably american sniper by chris kyle, partially offset lower revenues from the divergent series by veronica roth of $84 million and the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. the company sold 8.3 million net units of the divergent series in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 as compared to 19.2 million net units in fiscal 2014. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of $20 million, or 1%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015. digital sales, which consist of revenues generated through the sale of e-books and digital audio books, represented 22% of consumer revenues during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015. digital sales increased 11% as compared to fiscal 2014 due to the inclusion of harlequin results and increased digital audio book sales, partially offset by the lower contribution from the divergent series as well as a shift towards the non-fiction genre, which has lower e-book conversion. during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, harpercollins had 214 titles on the new york times print and digital bestseller lists, with 15 titles reaching the number one position.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, segment ebitda at the book publishing segment increased $24 million, or 12%, as compared to fiscal 2014. the increase was primarily the result of the harlequin acquisition, which contributed $32 million to segment ebitda, strong backlist sales in the general and childrens books categories and lower expenses at harpercollins other divisions, offset by the lower contribution from the divergent series and approximately $5 million of one-time transaction costs related to the acquisition of harlequin.

for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, revenues at the digital real estate services segment increased $217 million, or 53%, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the acquisition of move, which contributed $188 million in revenues during fiscal 2015, and higher revenues at rea group of $29 million due to the impact of increased listing depth product penetration in australia and higher pricing despite a decline in australian listing volumes across the market and the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of $44 million, or 11%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, segment ebitda at the digital real estate services segment decreased $13 million, or 6%, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to a loss of $39 million related to the acquisition of move, which includes approximately $19 million in one-time transaction costs related to the acquisition and $21 million of equity-based compensation expense, partially offset by the increased revenues at rea group, noted above. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a segment ebitda decrease of $25 million, or 12%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.

segment ebitda at the other segment for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 increased $26 million, or 11%, as compared to fiscal 2014. segment ebitda increased primarily due to lower costs associated with the u.k. newspaper matters. the net expense related to the u.k. newspaper matters included in selling, general and administrative expenses was $50 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 as compared to $72 million in fiscal 2014.
liquidity and capital resources current financial condition the companys principal source of liquidity is internally generated funds and cash and cash equivalents on hand. as of june 30, 2016, the companys cash and cash equivalents were $1,832 million. the company expects these elements of liquidity will enable it to meet its liquidity needs in the foreseeable future. in october 2013, the company established a revolving credit facility of $650 million, which terminates on october 23, 2020. the company may request that the commitments be extended under certain circumstances as set forth in the credit agreement and may also request increases in the amount of the facility up to a maximum amount of $900 million. in addition, the company expects to have access to the worldwide capital markets, subject to market conditions, in order to issue debt if needed or desired. although the company believes that its cash on hand and future cash from operations, together with its access to the capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund its operating and financing needs, its access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including: (i) the companys performance, (ii) its credit rating or absence of a credit rating, (iii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (iv) the current state of the economy. there can be no assurances that the company will continue to have access to the capital markets on acceptable terms. see part i, item 1a. risk factors for further discussion.
as of june 30, 2016, the companys consolidated assets included $813 million in cash and cash equivalents that was held by its foreign subsidiaries. $95 million of this amount is cash not readily accessible by the company as it is held by rea group, a majority owned but separately listed public company. rea group must declare a dividend in order for the company to have access to its share of rea groups cash balance. additionally, the company has specifically set aside $315 million of cash for use in the wireless group offer and has classified it as restricted cash as of june 30, 2016. the company earns income outside the u.s., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign jurisdictions. the company does not currently intend to repatriate these earnings. should the company require more capital in the u.s. than is generated by and/or available to its domestic operations, the company could elect to transfer funds held in foreign jurisdictions. the transfer of funds from foreign jurisdictions may be cumbersome due to local regulations, foreign exchange controls and withholding taxes. additionally, the transfer of funds from foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates and higher cash paid for income taxes for the company.

the principal uses of cash that affect the companys liquidity position include the following: operational expenditures including employee costs; paper purchases; capital expenditures; income tax payments; investments in associated entities and acquisitions. in addition to the acquisitions and dispositions disclosed elsewhere, the company has evaluated, and expects to continue to evaluate, possible future acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses. such transactions may be material and may involve cash, the issuance of the companys securities or the assumption of indebtedness.

reconciliation of free cash flow available to news corporation free cash flow available to news corporation is a non-gaap financial measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, less capital expenditures (free cash flow) less rea group free cash flow, plus cash dividends received from rea group. free cash flow available to news corporation excludes cash flows from discontinued operations. free cash flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, cash flows from continuing operations and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap. free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of free cash flow.
the company considers free cash flow available to news corporation to provide useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after capital expenditures which can then be used for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the companys business, strategic acquisitions, strengthening the companys balance sheet, dividend payouts and repurchasing stock. a limitation of free cash flow available to news corporation is that it does not represent the total increase or
65
decrease in the cash balance for the period. management compensates for the limitation of free cash flow available to news corporation by also relying on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with gaap which incorporate all cash movements during the period.
the following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by continuing operating activities to free cash flow available to news corporation:

free cash flow available to news corporation increased by $15 million in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 to $610 million from $595 million in fiscal 2015. the improvement was primarily due lower capital expenditures due to the absence of costs associated with the relocation of the companys operations to a new site in london in fiscal 2015, partially offset by lower cash provided by operating activities as discussed above. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a decrease of free cash flow available to news corporation of approximately $48 million, or 8% for fiscal 2016.
free cash flow available to news corporation in fiscal 2015 of $595 million increased from $561 million in fiscal 2014, primarily due to lower capital expenditures, as well as higher dividends received from rea and lower rea group cash flow, which is excluded from free cash flow available to news corporation, partially offset by lower cash provided by operating activities discussed above.
revolving credit facility the companys credit agreement (as amended, the credit agreement) provides for an unsecured $650 million revolving credit facility (the facility) that can be used for general corporate purposes. the facility has a sublimit of $100 million available for issuances of letters of credit. under the credit agreement, the company may request increases in the amount of the facility up to a maximum amount of $900 million.
in october 2015, the company entered into an amendment to the credit agreement (the amendment) which, among other things, extended the original term of the facility by two years and lowered the commitment fee payable by the company. as a result of the amendment, the lenders commitments now terminate on october 23, 2020, and any borrowings will be due at that time. the company may request that the commitments be extended under certain circumstances as set forth in the credit agreement for up to two additional one-year periods.
the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, with customary exceptions, including limitations on the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to engage in transactions with affiliates, incur liens, merge into or consolidate with any other entity, incur subsidiary debt or dispose of all or substantially all of its assets or all or substantially all of the stock of its subsidiaries. in addition, the credit agreement requires the company to maintain an adjusted operating income leverage ratio of not more than 3.0 to 1.0 and an interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0 to 1.0. if any of the events of default occur and are not cured within applicable grace periods or waived, any unpaid amounts under the credit agreement may be declared immediately due and payable. as of june 30, 2016, the company was in compliance with all of the applicable debt covenants.
66
interest on borrowings under the facility is based on either (a) a eurodollar rate formula or (b) the base rate formula, each as set forth in the credit agreement. the applicable margin and the commitment fee are based on the pricing grid in the credit agreement, which varies based on the companys adjusted operating income leverage ratio. as of june 30, 2016, the company was paying a commitment fee of 0.225% on any undrawn balance and an applicable margin of 0.50% for a base rate borrowing and 1.50% for a eurodollar rate borrowing.
as of the date of this filing, the company has not borrowed any funds under the facility.
rea group unsecured revolving loan facility rea group entered into a a$480 million unsecured syndicated revolving loan facility agreement in connection with the acquisition of iproperty. the rea facility consists of three sub facilities of a$120 million, a$120 million and a$240 million which become due in december 2017, december 2018 and december 2019, respectively. in february 2016, rea group drew down the full a$480 million (approximately $340 million as of such date) available under the rea facility, and the proceeds, less lenders fees of $1 million, were used to fund the iproperty acquisition. borrowings under the rea facility bear interest at a floating rate of the australian bbsy plus a margin in the range of 0.85% and 1.45% depending on rea groups net leverage ratio. as of june 30, 2016, rea group was paying a margin of between 1.00% and 1.20%. rea group paid approximately $4 million in interest for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 at a weighted average interest rate of 3.2%. the rea facility requires rea group to maintain a net leverage ratio of not more than 3.25 to 1.0 and an interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0 to 1.0. as of june 30, 2016, rea group was in compliance with all of the applicable debt covenants.
commitments the company has commitments under certain firm contractual arrangements (firm commitments) to make future payments. these firm commitments secure the future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of operations. the following table summarizes the companys material firm commitments as of june 30, 2016.

the company has certain contracts to purchase newsprint, ink and plates that require the company to purchase a percentage of its total requirements for production. since the quantities purchased annually under these contracts are not fixed and are based on the companys total requirements, the amount of the related payments for these purchases is excluded from the table above.
the table also excludes the companys pension obligations, other postretirement benefits (opeb) obligations and the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount and timing of the commitments. the company made contributions of $26 million and $9 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates and statutory requirements. the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately $25 million in fiscal 2017, assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the companys expected returns in fiscal 2016 and beyond, and that interest rates remain constant. the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans. payments due to participants under the companys pension plans are primarily paid out of underlying trusts. payments due under the companys opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid as medical costs incurred by covered retiree populations, and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under the companys opeb plans. the company expects its opeb payments to approximate $10 million in fiscal 2017. (see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).
contingencies the company routinely is involved in various legal proceedings, claims and governmental inspections or investigations, including those discussed below. the outcome of these matters and claims is subject to significant uncertainty, and the company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of pending matters will be or the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters. fees, expenses, fines, penalties, judgments or settlement costs which might be incurred by the company in connection with the various proceedings could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.
the company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims when it determines that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. the amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters. legal fees associated with litigation and similar proceedings are expensed as incurred. the company recognizes gain contingencies when the gain becomes realized or realizable. (see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements).
the companys operations are subject to tax in various domestic and international jurisdictions and as a matter of course, it is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. the company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of all pending tax matters and does not currently anticipate that the ultimate resolution of pending tax matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, future results of operations or liquidity. as subsidiaries of 21st century fox prior to the separation, the company and each of its domestic subsidiaries have joint and several liability with 21st century fox for the consolidated u.s. federal income taxes of the 21st century fox consolidated group relating to any taxable periods during which the company or any of the companys domestic subsidiaries are or were a member of the 21st century fox consolidated group. consequently, the company could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred, and not discharged, by any other member of the 21st century fox consolidated group. in conjunction with the separation, the company entered into the tax sharing and indemnification agreement with 21st century fox
68
(the tax sharing and indemnification agreement), which requires 21st century fox to indemnify the company for any such liability. disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the internal revenue service (irs) or other taxing authorities in amounts that the company cannot quantify.
critical accounting policies an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the companys financial condition and results and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the company. (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).
long-lived assets long-lived assets, including goodwill, newspaper mastheads, trade names, distribution networks, publishing rights, copyrighted products, trademarks and property, plant and equipment. assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. goodwill is recorded as the difference between the cost of acquiring an entity and the estimated fair values assigned to its tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment.
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill. the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of long-lived assets acquired, their reporting unit, as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income. the company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets the company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and at other times if a significant event or change in circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these assets has been reduced below their carrying value. the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment assessments. indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts, may signal that an asset has become impaired.
the valuation of goodwill requires assumptions and estimates of many factors, including revenue and market growth, operating cash flows, market multiples and discount rates. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, as part of the companys long-range planning process, the company completed its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test.
69
the company determined that the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets included in the balance sheets were not impaired for the companys reporting units. significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method for these reporting units were discount rates (ranging from 9%-14.5%), long-term growth rates (ranging from 0%-3.5%) and royalty rates (ranging from 0.5%-3.4%). significant unobservable inputs utilized in the market approach valuation methods were ebitda multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries and control premiums (ranging from 10%-15%).
significant increases (decreases) in royalty rates, growth rates, control premium and multiples, assuming no change in discount rates, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. significant decreases (increases) in discount rates, assuming no changes in royalty rates, growth rates, control premium and multiples, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.
the fair values of the companys reporting units in fiscal 2016 exceeded the respective carrying values in a range from approximately 8% to 18%. consequently, no impairments were identified. an approximate 400 basis point increase in the discount rate or, an approximate 700 basis point decrease in the projected cash flows terminal growth rate, would have resulted in a reporting unit of the news and information services segment and the cable network programming segment failing step one of the goodwill impairment analysis, which would have required the completion of step two of the goodwill impairment analysis. the goodwill at risk associated with these reporting units is nearly $1 billion as of june 30, 2016. the company will continue to monitor its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for possible future impairment.
property, plant and equipment the company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable, in accordance with asc 360, property, plant, and equipment (asc 360). an asset group is the lowest level of assets and liabilities for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. events or circumstances that might warrant an impairment recoverability review include, among other things, material declines in operating performance, significant adverse market conditions and planned changes in the use of an asset group.
in determining whether the carrying value of an asset group is recoverable, the company estimates undiscounted future cash flows over the estimated life of the primary asset of the asset group. the estimates of such future cash flows require estimating such factors as future operating performance, market conditions and the estimated holding period of each asset. if all or a portion of the carrying value of an asset group is found to be non-recoverable, the company records an impairment charge equal to the difference between the asset groups carrying value and its fair value. the company generally measures fair value by considering sales prices for similar assets or by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate. typical assumptions applied when using a market-based approach include projected ebitda and related multiples. typical assumptions applied when using an income approach include projected free cash flows, discount rates and long-term growth rates. all of these assumptions are made by management based on the best available information at the time of the estimates and are subject to deviations from actual results.
in fiscal 2016, given the decline in operating performance at certain reporting units, the company performed an analysis over fixed to determine if such assets continue to be recoverable. as a result of the analysis, the company determined that the fixed assets reviewed as part of the analysis continue to be recoverable.
income taxes the company is subject to income taxes in the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and records its tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences in its reported results of operations. tax laws
70
are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining the companys tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties as promulgated under asc 740, income taxes.
the companys annual tax rate is based on its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. significant management judgment is required in determining the companys provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the companys net deferred tax assets, if any. in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets, management considers historical results and estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income. the companys actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, tax planning, the outcome of tax audits and the companys forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods. although the company believes current estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.
the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. management re-evaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available. the companys policy is to recognize, when applicable, interest and penalties on unrecognized income tax benefits as part of income tax benefit (expense).
retirement benefit obligations the companys employees participate in various defined benefit pension and postretirement plans sponsored by the company and its subsidiaries. (see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).
the company records amounts relating to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on calculations specified by gaap. the measurement and recognition of the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans require the use of significant management judgments, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality and other actuarial assumptions. net periodic benefit costs (income) is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected rate of return on plan assets. current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, were considered in making these assumptions. in developing the expected long-term rate of return, the pension portfolios past average rate of returns, and future return expectations of the various asset classes were considered. the expected long-term rate of return is based on a direct asset allocation assumption of 26% equities, 62% fixed-income securities and 12% cash and other investments. total net periodic benefit costs (income) for the plans were $8 million, $(4) million and $7 million, for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the discount rate reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed-income investments on the companys annual measurement date of june 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year. the discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. the rate was determined by matching the companys expected benefit payments for the plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred high-quality non-callable corporate bonds. for fiscal 2016 and the prior periods presented, the company estimated the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs (income) utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate for each country in which the company has plans derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation.
71
the key assumptions used in developing the companys fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 net periodic benefit costs (income) for its plans consist of the following:

the weighted average discount rate is volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon the prevailing rates in the u.s., the u.k. and australia as of the measurement date. beginning in fiscal 2017, the company will change the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost (income) for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. the new method utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows. the company will change to the new method to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and their corresponding spot rates. the change is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate which is applied prospectively. although the discount rate used for each plan will be established and applied individually, a weighted average discount rate of 3.1% will be used in calculating the fiscal 2017 net periodic benefit costs (income). this change in estimate is not expected to have a material impact on the companys pension and postretirement net periodic benefit expense in future periods.
the company will use a weighted average long-term rate of return of 5.7% for fiscal 2017 based principally on a combination of current asset mix and historical experience of actual plan returns. the accumulated net pre-tax losses on the companys pension plans as of june 30, 2016 were approximately $610 million which increased from approximately $570 million for the companys pension plans as of june 30, 2015. this increase of $40 million was primarily due to a reduction in the discount rate across all plans and utilized in measuring the companys domestic and international pension obligations. lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the companys deferred losses and also increase subsequent-year benefit costs. higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduce the companys accumulated net loss and also decrease subsequent-year benefit costs. these deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic benefit costs (income) in accordance with asc 715, compensationretirement benefits. unrecognized losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation are recognized over the average life expectancy for plan participants.
the company made contributions of $26 million, $9 million and $137 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. in fiscal 2014, approximately $37 million of the contributions were made by a third party in connection with the sale of a business in a prior period on behalf of former employees who retained certain pension benefits. future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns, statutory requirements and interest rate movements. assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the companys expected plan returns in fiscal 2016 and beyond, and that interest rates remain constant, the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately $25 million in fiscal 2017. the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans. (see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).
72
changes in net periodic benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the companys expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events. the following table highlights the sensitivity of the companys pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant:

references in the following discussion to "we", "our", "us", "dps" or "the company" refer to dr pepper snapple group, inc. and all entities included in our audited consolidated financial statements.
the periods presented in this section are the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, which we refer to as "2016", "2015" and "2014", respectively.
overview we are a leading integrated brand owner, manufacturer and distributor of non-alcoholic beverages in the u.s., canada and mexico with a diverse portfolio of flavored (non-cola) csds and ncbs, including ready-to-drink teas, juices, juice drinks, water and mixers. our brand portfolio includes popular csd brands such as dr pepper, canada dry, peñafiel, squirt, 7up, crush, a&w, sunkist soda and schweppes, and ncb brands such as snapple, hawaiian punch, mott's, clamato, bai brands, mr & mrs t mixers and rose's. our largest brand, dr pepper, is a leading flavored csd in the u.s. according to iri. we have some of the most recognized beverage brands in north america, with significant consumer awareness levels and long histories that evoke strong emotional connections with consumers.
we operate as an integrated brand owner, manufacturer and distributor through our three segments. we believe our integrated business model strengthens our route-to-market and provides opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses through both our dsd system and our wd delivery system. our integrated business model enables us to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers and allows us to more fully leverage our scale and reduce costs by creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage.
we operate primarily in the u.s., mexico and canada and we also distribute our products in the caribbean. in 2016, 90% of our net sales were generated in the u.s., 7% in mexico and the caribbean and 3% in canada.
uncertainties and trends affecting our business we believe the north american lrb market is influenced by certain key trends and uncertainties. some of these items, such as increased health consciousness and changes in economic factors, have created category headwinds for our csds during recent years. the key trends and uncertainties that could affect our business include:
•   increased health consciousness. consumers are increasingly becoming more concerned about health and wellness, focusing on caloric intake and sugar content in both regular csds and juices, the use of artificial sweeteners in diet csds and the use of natural, organic or simple ingredients in lrb products. we believe the main beneficiaries of this trend include bottled waters, naturally sweetened, low calorie drinks, all natural and organic beverages and ready-to-drink teas. our completion of the bai brands merger on january 31, 2017 will allow us to continue distribution and capture additional growth as a result of this key trend.
•   changes in consumer preferences. we are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs. we believe marketing and product innovations that target fast growing population segments, such as the hispanic community in the u.s., could drive market growth. additionally, as more consumers are faced with a busy and on-the-go lifestyle, sales of single-serve beverages could increase, which typically have higher margins.
•   increased competition in the lrb market. a number of our competitors are large corporations with significant financial resources. these competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities, which could reduce the demand for our products.
25
•   fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate variability in the expected future cash flows associated with certain third-party and intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than our mexican and canadian entities' functional currencies. we use derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate a portion of our exposure in these expected future cash flows to changes in foreign exchange rates. significant changes in these exchange rates will impact our results of operations.
•   increased government regulation. government agencies, as a result of concerns about the public health consequences and health care costs associated with obesity, have been proposing and, in some cases, enacting new taxes or regulations on sugar-sweetened and diet beverages. any changes of regulations or imposed taxes could reduce demand and/or cause us to raise our prices.
•   volatility in the costs of raw materials. the costs of a substantial portion of the raw materials used in the beverage industry are dependent on commodity prices for resin, aluminum, diesel fuel, corn, apple juice concentrate, sucrose, natural gas and other commodities. we are also dependent on commodity prices for apples related to our applesauce production. commodity price volatility has, from time to time, exerted pressure on industry margins and operating results.
•   product and packaging innovation. we believe brand owners and bottling companies will continue to create new products and packages, such as beverages with new ingredients and new premium flavors and innovative convenient packaging, that address changes in consumer tastes and preferences.
•   changing retailer landscape. as retailers continue to consolidate, we believe retailers will support consumer product companies that can provide an attractive portfolio of products, a strong value proposition and efficient delivery.
as a result of these uncertainties and other factors, we currently believe the following guidance for the year ending december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016:
•   net sales could increase approximately 4.5%, which includes a 3.0% increase in net sales due to the bai brands merger and a 1.0% unfavorable foreign currency translation impact.
•   non-cash costs related to the bai brands merger are expected to reduce income from operations between $33 million - $36 million.
•   excluding the bai brands merger, packaging and ingredient costs for the year ending december 31, 2017 are expected to increase 0.5% on a constant volume/mix basis as compared to the year ended december 31, 2016.
•   the adoption of a new accounting standard will result in incremental income tax benefit of approximately $14 million.
refer to item 1a, "risk factors" of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our company.
seasonality the beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations. our beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months and also can be influenced by the timing of holidays as well as weather fluctuations.
segments we report our business in three operating segments:
•   the beverage concentrates segment reflects sales of our branded concentrates and syrup to third party bottlers primarily in the u.s. and canada. most of the brands in this segment are csd brands.
•   the packaged beverages segment reflects sales in the u.s. and canada from the manufacture and distribution of finished beverages and other products, including sales of our own brands and third party brands, through both dsd and wd.
•   the latin america beverages segment reflects sales in mexico, the caribbean and other international markets from the manufacture and distribution of concentrates, syrup and finished beverages.
segment results are based on management reports. net sales and sop are the significant financial measures used to assess the operating performance of our operating segments.
26
volume in evaluating our performance, we consider different volume measures depending on whether we sell beverage concentrates or finished beverages.
beverage concentrates sales volume in our beverage concentrates segment, we measure our sales volume in two ways: (1) "concentrate case sales" and (2) "bottler case sales." the unit of measurement for both concentrate case sales and bottler case sales equals 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage, the equivalent of 24 twelve ounce servings.
concentrate case sales represent units of measurement for concentrates sold by us to our bottlers and distributors. a concentrate case is the amount of concentrate needed to make one case of 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage. it does not include any other component of the finished beverage other than concentrate. our net sales in our concentrate businesses are based on our sales of concentrate cases.
although net sales in our concentrate businesses are based on concentrate case sales, we believe that bottler case sales are also a significant measure of our performance because they measure sales of packaged beverages into retail channels.
packaged beverages and latin america beverages sales volume in our packaged beverages and latin america beverages segments, we measure volume as case sales to customers. a case sale represents a unit of measurement equal to 288 fluid ounces of packaged beverage sold by us. case sales include both our owned brands and certain brands licensed to and/or distributed by us.
volume in bottler case sales in addition to sales volume, we measure volume in bottler case sales ("volume (bcs)") as sales of packaged beverages, in equivalent 288 fluid ounce cases, sold by us and our bottling partners to retailers and independent distributors. our contract manufacturing sales are not included or reported as part of volume (bcs).
bottler case sales and concentrates and packaged beverage sales volumes are not equal during any given period due to changes in bottler concentrates inventory levels, which can be affected by seasonality, bottler inventory and manufacturing practices and the timing of price increases and new product introductions.

in branded csds, squirt increased 6% primarily driven by increased sales to third-party bottlers and product innovation in our latin america beverages segment and our hispanic strategy in the u.s. schweppes grew 8% reflecting distribution gains in our sparkling water and growth in the ginger ale category. dr pepper had gains of 1% driven primarily by increases in our fountain business. regular dr pepper increased compared to the prior year, which was partially offset by declines in diet. peñafiel increased 3% in our latin america beverages segment as a result of distribution gains, increased promotional activity and product innovation, partially offset by increased competition. crush grew 3% in the current year. these gains were partially offset by a 2% decline in our other csd brands compared to the prior year. canada dry, 7up, a&w and sunkist soda (our "core 4 brands") were flat compared to the prior year, driven by an 6% increase in canada dry fully offset by a 5% decline in 7up, a 2% decrease in a&w and a 1% decline in sunkist soda.
in branded ncbs, our water category increased 18% primarily due to incremental promotional activity behind bai brands primarily in our club channel, distribution gains for bai brands, fiji and core hydration, and an increase in aguafiel due to category growth in mexico. clamato increased 10% primarily due to increased promotional activity, distribution gains, and product innovation in our latin america beverages segment and increased promotional activity in the u.s.. these increases were partially offset by declines in hawaiian punch, mott's and our other ncb brands in total. hawaiian punch declined 6% due to category headwinds and higher pricing for our single-serve packages while mott's decreased 3% due to declines in the juice category and higher pricing for our single-serve packages, partially offset by gains in our sauce products. our other ncb brands in total declined 8%. snapple was flat compared to prior year.
29
net sales. net sales increased $158 million, or approximately 3%, for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared with the year ended december 31, 2015. the primary drivers of the increase in net sales included:
•   favorable product and package mix, which increased net sales by about 2.5%;
•   increase in shipments, which increased net sales by 1.0%;
•   higher pricing, which increased net sales by 1.0%;
•   unfavorable foreign currency translation of $79 million, which decreased net sales by 1.0%; and
•   unfavorable segment mix, which decreased net sales by 0.5%.
gross profit. gross profit increased $135 million, or approximately 4%, for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared with the year ended december 31, 2015. gross margin was 59.9% for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the gross margin of 59.3% for the year ended december 31, 2015. the following drivers impacted the gross margin:
•   favorable comparison in our mark-to-market activity on commodity derivative contracts, which increased our gross margin by 0.5%.
•   lower commodity costs, led by packaging, and the change in our last-in, first-out ("lifo") inventory provision, which increased our gross margin by 0.5%;
•   increase in our net pricing, which increased our gross margin by 0.4%;
•   ongoing productivity improvements, which increased our gross margin by 0.4%;
•   unfavorable product, package and segment mix, which decreased our gross margin by 0.7%;
•   unfavorable foreign currency effects, which decreased our gross margin by 0.3%; and
•   increase in our other manufacturing costs, which decreased our gross margin by 0.2%.
the favorable mark-to-market activity on commodity derivative contracts for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $21 million in unrealized gains versus $13 million in unrealized losses in the prior year.
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expenses increased $16 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared with the prior year. the increase was primarily driven by higher people costs, a $4 million arbitration award related to our mexican joint venture, increased professional fees, a non-recurring charge of $4 million related to the transition of a certain employee benefit program and increases in other miscellaneous expenses. these increases were partially offset by lower logistics costs, driven by fuel rates, the impact of favorable foreign currency effects, which decreased sg&a expenses by $27 million, and a $23 million favorable comparison in the mark-to-market activity on commodity derivative contracts. for the year ended december 31, 2016, we recognized $31 million in unrealized gains related to the mark-to-market activity on commodity derivative contracts versus $8 million in unrealized gains in the year ago period.
other operating (income) expense, net. other operating (income) expense, net had a favorable change of $10 million due primarily to the $7 million favorable comparison related to the brand value impairment of garden cocktail recognized in the prior year and a $5 million gain on the step-acquisition of industria embotelladora de bebidas mexicanas ("iebm") and embotelladora mexicana de agua, s.a. de c.v. ("ema").
income from operations. income from operations increased $135 million to $1,433 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, due primarily to the increase in gross profit, the favorable change in other operating (income) expense, net and the decrease in depreciation and amortization, driven by certain fully depreciated fixed assets. these drivers were partially offset by the increase in sg&a expenses.
30
interest expense. interest expense increased $30 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared with the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily driven by:
•   $12 million of mark-to-market activity recorded during the fourth quarter of 2016 for four derivative instruments, as the hedging relationships between the four outstanding interest rate swaps and our 2.70% senior notes due november 15, 2022 were de-designated on october 1, 2016;
•   $5 million of amortization of deferred financing costs associated with the 364-day bridge loan facility (the "bridge facility");
•   higher average debt balance and higher average interest rates attributable to the issuance of our 3.40% senior notes due november 15, 2025 (the "2025 notes") and 4.50% senior notes due november 15, 2045 (the "2045 notes") during the fourth quarter of 2015; and
•   the issuance of the senior unsecured notes during the fourth quarter of 2016 for the bai brands merger.
loss on early extinguishment of debt. in october 2016, we redeemed a portion of the 2018 notes and retired, at a premium, an aggregate principal amount of approximately $360 million with the proceeds from the issuance of our 2.55% senior notes due on september 15, 2026 (the "2026 notes"). the loss on early extinguishment of the 2018 notes, which primarily represented the redemption premium, was approximately $31 million. there was no loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2015.
other income, net. other income, net increased $24 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared with the year ended december 31, 2015 driven primarily by a $21 million gain on the extinguishment of a multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liability.
effective tax rate. the effective tax rates for the year ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 were 33.8% and 35.5%, respectively. for the year ended december 31, 2016, the provision for income taxes included an income tax benefit of $17 million driven primarily by a restructuring of the ownership of our canadian business. the income tax benefit includes a valuation allowance release of $11 million.

in branded ncbs, our water category increased 13% due to distribution gains and product innovation for bai brands and marketing investments behind fiji. snapple grew 6% over last year primarily driven by product innovation and distribution gains. clamato increased 12% primarily due to distribution gains and increased promotional activity in our latin america beverages segment. hawaiian punch grew 3% primarily as a result of package innovation. these increases were partially offset by a 1% decrease in mott's and a 3% decline in our other ncb brands in total.
net sales. net sales increased $161 million, or approximately 3%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared with the year ended december 31, 2014. the primary drivers of the increase were favorable product and package mix, an increase in branded sales volumes, favorable segment mix and higher pricing, partially offset by $115 million in unfavorable foreign currency translation.
gross profit. gross profit increased $93 million, or approximately 3%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared with the year ended december 31, 2014. although the gross margin for the year ended december 31, 2015 of 59.3% remain unchanged year over year, the following drivers impacted the gross margin:
•   lower commodity costs, led by packaging, and net of the change in our last-in, first-out ("lifo") inventory provision, which increased our gross margin by 0.8%;
•   ongoing productivity improvements, which increased our gross margin by 0.5%;
•   decrease in our other manufacturing costs, which increased our gross margin by 0.2%;
•   increase in our net pricing, which increased our gross margin by 0.1%;
•   unfavorable product, package and segment mix, which decreased our gross margin by 0.7%;
•   unfavorable foreign currency effects, which decreased our gross margin by 0.5%; and
•   unfavorable comparison in our mark-to-market activity on commodity derivative contracts, which decreased our gross margin by 0.4%.
the unfavorable mark-to-market activity on commodity derivative contracts for the year ended december 31, 2015 was $13 million in unrealized losses versus $11 million in unrealized gains in the prior year.
sg&a expenses. sg&a expenses decreased $21 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared with the prior year. the decrease was primarily driven by the impact of favorable foreign currency effects, which decreased sg&a expenses by $41 million, and a $32 million favorable comparison in the mark-to-market activity on commodity derivative contracts. for the year ended december 31, 2015, we recognized $8 million in unrealized gains related to the mark-to-market activity on commodity derivative contracts versus $24 million in unrealized losses in the year ago period. these drivers were partially offset by higher people costs, which were driven by inflationary increases and the impact of increased sales volumes, and higher performance-based incentive compensation.
income from operations. income from operations increased $118 million to $1,298 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, due primarily to the increase in gross profit and decreases in sg&a expenses and depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a non-cash charge of $7 million for the brand value impairment of garden cocktail.
interest expense. interest expense increased $8 million primarily driven by the impact of the issuance of our 3.40% senior notes due november 15, 2025 (the "2025 notes") and 4.50% senior notes due november 15, 2045 (the "2045 notes") during the fourth quarter of 2015.
effective tax rate. the effective tax rates for the year ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 were 35.5% and 34.6%, respectively. the 2015 effective tax rate was higher, compared to the prior year, as a result of an income tax benefit in 2014 of $4 million due to the resolution of a tax audit in a foreign jurisdiction.

liquidity and capital resources trends and uncertainties affecting liquidity customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by various risk factors discussed in item 1a, "risk factors", including recession or other economic downturn in the u.s., mexico and the caribbean or canada, which could result in a reduction in our sales volume. similarly, disruptions in financial and credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors. these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us, thus reducing our cash flow, or the ability of our vendors to timely supply materials.
38
we believe that the following events, trends and uncertainties may also impact liquidity:
•   the closing of the bai brands merger in january 2017, which reduced our liquidity by approximately $1,653 million;
•   our continued repurchases of our outstanding common stock pursuant to our repurchase programs;
•   continued payment of dividends;
•   continued capital expenditures;
•   seasonality of our operating cash flows could impact short-term liquidity;
•   our ability to negotiate a new credit agreement to replace our existing credit facility which expires in september 2017;
•   our ability to issue unsecured commercial paper notes ("commercial paper") on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $500 million;
•   fluctuations in our tax obligations;
•   future equity investments in allied brands; and
•   future mergers or acquisitions of regional bottling companies, distributors and/or distribution rights to further extend our geographic coverage.
financing arrangements the following descriptions represent our available financing arrangements as of december 31, 2016. as of december 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenant requirements for our senior unsecured notes, unsecured credit agreement, commercial paper program and bridge financing commitment letter.
commercial paper program on december 10, 2010, we entered into a commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $500 million. the maturities of the commercial paper will vary, but may not exceed 364 days from the date of issuance. we issue commercial paper as needed for general corporate purposes. the program is supported by the revolver (as defined below). outstanding commercial paper reduces the amount of borrowing capacity available under the revolver and outstanding amounts under the revolver reduce the commercial paper availability. under this program, we had weighted average commercial paper borrowings of $1 million, $23 million and $67 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with maturities of 90 days or less. these commercial paper borrowings had a weighted average rate of 0.65%, 0.50% and 0.23% for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no commercial paper outstanding.
unsecured credit agreement on september 25, 2012, we entered into a five-year unsecured credit agreement (the "credit agreement"), which provides for a $500 million revolving line of credit (the "revolver"). borrowings under the revolver bear interest at a floating rate per annum based upon the alternate base rate ("abr") or the eurodollar rate, in each case plus an applicable margin which varies based upon our debt ratings. rates range from 0.000% to 0.300% for abr loans and from 0.795% to 1.300% for eurodollar loans. the abr is defined as the greater of (a) jpmorgan chase bank's prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.500% and (c) the adjusted libor for a one month interest period. the adjusted libor is the london interbank offered rate for dollars adjusted for a statutory reserve rate set by the board of governors of the u.s. federal reserve system.
additionally, the revolver is available for the issuance of letters of credit and swingline advances not to exceed $75 million and $50 million, respectively. swingline advances will accrue interest at a rate equal to the abr plus the applicable margin. letters of credit and swingline advances will reduce, on a dollar for dollar basis, the amount available under the revolver.
we are currently in the process of negotiating a new credit agreement to replace the credit agreement, as it is maturing in september 2017.
39
the following table provides amounts utilized and available under the revolver and each sublimit arrangement type as of december 31, 2016:
(in millions)        amount utilized                  balances available revolver             $-                                    $500

swingline advances   -                                       50
the credit agreement further provides that we may request at any time, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, that the aggregate commitments under the facility be increased by a total amount not to exceed $250 million.
the credit agreement's representations, warranties, covenants and events of default are generally customary for investment grade credit and include a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt (as defined in the credit agreement) to annualized consolidated ebitda (as defined in the credit agreement) of no more than 3.00 to 1.00, tested quarterly. upon the occurrence of an event of default, among other things, amounts outstanding under the credit agreement may be accelerated and the commitments may be terminated. our obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries on the terms set forth in the credit agreement. the credit agreement has a maturity date of september 25, 2017; however, with the consent of lenders holding more than 50% of the total commitments under the credit agreement and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, we may extend the maturity date for up to two additional one-year terms.
a facility fee is payable quarterly to the lenders on the unused portion of the commitments available under the revolver equal to 0.08% to 0.20% per annum, depending upon our debt ratings.
bridge financing for bai brands on november 21, 2016, the company entered into the bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1,700 million, in order to ensure that financing would be available for the bai brands merger. refer to note 9 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for information on fees incurred in connection with the bridge facility.
the capacity of the bridge facility is reduced dollar-for-dollar by the consummation of any debt or equity offerings or any asset sales, as defined in the commitment letter filed in our form 8-k on november 23, 2016. the issuance of four tranches of senior unsecured notes, consisting of the 2021-b notes for $250 million, the 2023 notes for $500 million, the 2027 notes for $400 million and the 2046 notes for $400 million (collectively, the "acquisition notes") in december 2016 reduced the capacity of the bridge facility by the net proceeds received of $1,541 million, and as of december 31, 2016, $159 million remained available to the company under the bridge facility. on january 31, 2017, in accordance with its terms, the remaining commitment under the bridge facility was automatically terminated upon the company's funding of the bai brands merger with the net proceeds from the acquisition notes and cash on hand.
shelf registration statement on august 10, 2016, our board authorized us to issue up to $2,000 million of securities from time to time. subsequently, we filed a "well-known seasoned issuer" shelf registration statement with the sec, effective september 2, 2016, which registers an indeterminable amount of securities for future sales. on november 16, 2016, the board increased the authorized aggregate amount of securities available to be issued by an additional $400 million. as of december 31, 2016, we have issued senior unsecured notes of $1,950 million, as described in note 9 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements, leaving $450 million available for issuance under the authorization as of december 31, 2016.
letters of credit facilities we currently have letters of credit facilities available in addition to the portion of the revolver available for issuance of letters of credit. under these incremental letters of credit facilities, $120 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit, $60 million of which was utilized as of december 31, 2016 and $60 million of which remains available for use.
liquidity based on our current and anticipated level of operations, we believe that our operating cash flows and cash on hand will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations for the next twelve months. to the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, we may utilize amounts available under our financing arrangements, if necessary.

these debt and commercial paper ratings impact the interest we pay on our financing arrangements. a downgrade of one or both of our debt and commercial paper ratings could increase our interest expense and decrease the cash available to fund anticipated obligations.
capital expenditures capital expenditures were $180 million, $179 million and $170 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. capital expenditures for the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily related to machinery and equipment, our distribution fleet, and costs associated with a new manufacturing plant in mexico.

in 2017, we expect to incur annual capital expenditures, net of proceeds from disposals, in an amount of approximately 3% of our net sales, which we expect to fund through cash provided by operating activities.
cash and cash equivalents as a result of the above items, cash and cash equivalents increased $876 million since december 31, 2015 to $1,787 million as of december 31, 2016, primarily driven by the issuance of senior unsecured notes in december 2016 and our net cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by increased distributions to our shareholders.

we may continue to make future equity investments in allied brands and/or acquisitions of regional bottling companies, distributors and/or distribution rights to further extend our geographic coverage. any acquisitions may require additional funding for future capital expenditures and possibly restructuring expenses.
total shareholder distributions our board declared aggregate dividends per share during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 of $2.12, $1.92 and $1.64, respectively, and we continued common stock repurchases based upon authorizations from our board. the following chart details these payments during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

contractual commitments and obligations we enter into various contractual obligations that impact, or could impact, our liquidity. based on our current and anticipated level of operations, we believe that our proceeds from operating cash flows and cash on hand will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations. to the extent that our operating cash flows and cash on hand are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, we may utilize amounts available under our financing arrangements, if necessary. refer to note 9 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the senior unsecured notes payments described in this table.

____________________________
(1)   amounts represent payment for the senior unsecured notes issued by us. please refer to note 9 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information.
(2)   amount represents consideration for the bai brands merger, which was primarily paid on january 31, 2017. please refer to note 3 and note 24 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information.
(3)   amounts represent our contractual payment obligations for our lease arrangements classified as capital leases. these amounts exclude renewal options not yet executed but were included in the lease term to determine the capital lease obligation as the lease imposes a penalty on us in such amount that the renewal appeared reasonably assured at lease inception.
(4)   amounts represent minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.
(5)   amounts represent payments under agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including capital obligations and long-term contractual obligations. long-term contractual obligations include, but are not limited to, commodity commitments and marketing commitments including sponsorships. amounts exclude any gain or loss upon settlement of commodity derivative instruments. refer to note 10 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information.
(6)   amounts represent our estimated interest payments based on specified interest rates for fixed rate debt and the impact of interest rate swaps that effectively convert fixed interest rates to variable interest rates. amounts exclude any gain or loss upon settlement of related interest rate swaps. refer to note 10 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information.
amounts excluded from our table as of december 31, 2016, we had $19 million of non-current unrecognized tax benefits, related interest and penalties classified as a long-term liability. the table above does not reflect any payments related to these amounts as it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or timing of the payment. refer to note 12 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information.

the total accrued benefit liability representing the underfunded position for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of december 31, 2016 was approximately $39 million. this amount is impacted by, among other items, funding levels, plan amendments, changes in plan assumptions and the investment return on plan assets. we did not include estimated payments related to our total accrued benefit liability in the table above.
the pension protection act of 2006 was enacted in august 2006 and established, among other things, new standards for funding of u.s. defined benefit pension plans. we generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities. our international pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations. we did not include our estimated contributions to our various single employer plans in the table above.
refer to note 13 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our single employer plans discussed above.
we have a deferred compensation plan where the assets are maintained in a rabbi trust and the corresponding liability related to the plan is recorded in other non-current liabilities. we did not include estimated payments related to the deferred compensation liability as the timing and payment of these amounts are determined by the participants and outside our control. refer to note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information.
in general, we are covered under conventional insurance programs with high deductibles or are self-insured for large portions of many different types of claims. our accrued liabilities for our losses related to these programs is estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claim history. as of december 31, 2016, our accrued liabilities for our losses related to these programs totaled approximately $103 million. refer to notes 8 and 11 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information. we did not include estimated payments related to our insurance liability in the table above.
off-balance sheet arrangements we currently participate in three multi-employer pension plans. in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans, the plan will ultimately assess us a withdrawal liability for exiting the plan, and u.s. gaap would require us to record the withdrawal charge as an expense in our consolidated statements of income and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets once the multi-employer pension withdrawal charge is probable and estimable. there are no other off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources other than letters of credit outstanding.
refer to note 9 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding outstanding letters of credit.
critical accounting estimates the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. critical accounting estimates are both fundamental to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results and require difficult, subjective or complex estimates and assessments. these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, future expectations and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. the most significant estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised when necessary. we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess or measure our critical accounting estimates. we have identified the items described below as our critical accounting estimates. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use in our critical accounting estimates. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to our consolidated financial statements. see note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these and other accounting policies.

the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value. if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, impairment is recorded. the impairment tests for goodwill include comparing a fair value of the respective reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill and considering any indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges ("step 1"). if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, impairment is indicated and a second step ("step 2") analysis must be performed.                                                                                                                                                                                                critical assumptions include revenue growth and profit performance, as well as an appropriate discount rate. discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of equity and cost of debt, adjusted with various risk premiums. for 2016, such discount rates ranged from 5.00% to 10.25%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               we have not identified any impairments in goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets during the year.
the effect of a 1% increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the reporting units as of october 1, 2016 would not change our conclusion, as the fair value of the reporting units would still exceed the carrying value for all of our goodwill by at least 100%.
the effect of a 1% increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of our brands as of october 1, 2016 would reduce the fair value of our brands but would not change our conclusion. the result of this effect would impact the amount of headroom over the carrying value of our brands as follows (in millions):

our largest u.s. defined benefit pension plan, which is a cash balance plan, was suspended and the accrued benefit was frozen effective december 31, 2008. participants in this plan no longer earn additional benefits for future services or salary increases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      the key assumptions we use in the actuarial methods to determine the plan obligations and related expenses include: (1) the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the plan liabilities; (2) retirement age and mortality; and (3) the expected return on plan assets. our assumptions reflect our historical experience and our best judgment regarding future performance.
employee benefit plan obligations and expenses included in our consolidated financial statements are determined from actuarial analyses based on plan assumptions, employee demographic data, years of service, compensation, benefits paid and employer contributions.                                                                                                                                                                                                               refer to note 13 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information about the key assumptions.
risk management programs we retain selected levels of property, casualty, workers' compensation, health and other business risks. many of these risks are covered under conventional insurance programs with high deductibles or self-insured retentions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      we believe the use of actuarial methods to estimate our future losses provides a consistent and effective way to measure our self-insured liabilities. however, the estimation of our liability is judgmental and uncertain given the nature of claims involved and length of time until their ultimate cost is known.                                                                       we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our self-insured liabilities. the final settlement amount of claims can differ materially from our estimate as a result of changes in factors such as the frequency and severity of accidents, medical cost inflation, legislative actions, uncertainty around jury verdicts and awards and other factors outside of our control.
accrued liabilities related to the retained casualty and health risks are calculated based on loss experience and development factors, which contemplate a number of variables including claim history and expected trends. these loss development factors are established in consultation with actuaries.                                                                                   a 10% change in our accrued liabilities related to the retained risks, net of associated receivables, as of december 31, 2016 would have affected income from operations by approximately $9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016.
income taxes we establish income tax liabilities to remove some or all of the income tax benefit of any of our income tax positions based upon one of the following: (1) the tax position is not "more likely than not" to be sustained, (2) the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained, but for a lesser amount, or (3) the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained , but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken.              our liability for uncertain tax positions contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions.                                                                                                                                                                               our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include questions regarding our tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. as these audits progress, events may occur that cause us to change our liability for uncertain tax positions.
we assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets. valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     we base our judgment of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset primarily on historical earnings, our estimate of current and expected future earnings and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.                                                                                                                                                                                to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability for uncertain tax positions has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution.
if results differ from our assumptions, a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may be increased or decreased which would impact our effective tax rate.

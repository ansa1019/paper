overview we are a full service, early-stage contract research organization (cro). for 70 years, we have been in the business of providing the research models required in research and development of new drugs, devices, and therapies. over this time, we have built upon our original core competency of laboratory animal medicine and science (research model technologies) to develop a diverse portfolio of discovery and safety assessment services, both good laboratory practice (glp) and non-glp, which are able to support our clients from target identification through non-clinical development. we also provide a suite of products and services to support our clients' manufacturing activities. utilizing our broad portfolio of products and services enables our clients to create a more flexible drug development model, which reduces their costs, enhances their productivity and effectiveness, and increases speed to market.
our client base includes all of the major global biopharmaceutical companies, many biotechnology companies, cros, agricultural and industrial chemical companies, life science companies, veterinary medicine companies, contract manufacturing organizations, medical device companies, and diagnostic and other commercial entities, as well as leading hospitals, academic institutions, and government agencies around the world. we currently operate approximately 75 facilities in 23 countries worldwide, which numbers exclude our insourcing solutions (is) sites.
business trends the demand for our products and services increased in fiscal year 2016. our pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients continued to intensify their use of strategic outsourcing to improve their operating efficiency and to access capabilities that they do not maintain internally. many of our large biopharmaceutical clients have refocused on their drug discovery and early-stage development efforts, after a period of greater emphasis on late-stage programs to bring new drugs to market. in addition, small and mid-size biopharmaceutical clients benefited from the continued strength in the biotechnology funding environment in fiscal year 2016, from capital markets, partnering with large biopharmaceutical companies, and investment by venture capital. academia has also benefited from partnering activities, as large biopharmaceutical companies have increasingly utilized academic research capabilities to broaden the scope of their research activities. our full service, early-stage portfolio continued to lead to additional client discussions in fiscal year 2016 regarding strategic relationships, where clients seek to outsource larger portions of their early-stage drug research programs to us.
the primary result of these trends was improved demand for our safety assessment services in fiscal year 2016, particularly from biotechnology clients. this improvement led to increased capacity utilization in our safety assessment facilities, with utilization approaching optimal levels. price also improved moderately in fiscal year 2016, as industry capacity utilization continued to increase. in view of client demand, we expanded our global footprint and reinforced our scientific leadership in safety assessment services by acquiring wrh, inc. (wil research) in april 2016. we also opened small amounts of new capacity in fiscal year 2016, including the re-opening of our charles river massachusetts facility. we believe our scientific expertise, quality, and responsiveness remain key criteria when our clients make the decision to outsource to us.
demand for our products and services that support our clients' manufacturing activities was also robust in fiscal year 2016. demand for our microbial solutions business remained strong as manufacturers continued to increase their use of our rapid microbial testing solutions. our biologics testing solutions (biologics) business continued to benefit from increased demand for services associated with the growing proportion of biologic drugs in the pipeline and on the market. to enhance our ability to support biologic and biosimilar development, we acquired blue stream laboratories, inc. (blue stream) in june 2016.
as our clients continue to pursue their goal of more efficient and effective drug research, they are evaluating outsourcing new areas of their research programs, such as discovery services. we have enhanced our discovery services capabilities over the past three years to enable us to work with clients at the earliest stages of the discovery process. in fiscal year 2016, demand from biotechnology clients was strong for discovery services, but demand from larger biopharmaceutical clients fluctuated, particularly for our early discovery capabilities. we believe this is due to the fact that large biopharmaceutical companies have significant internal discovery capabilities, on which they can choose to rely. in order for large biopharmaceutical clients to
30
increasingly outsource more work to us, we must continue to demonstrate that our services can augment and accelerate our clients' drug discovery process. we implemented business changes, including a small site consolidation and realignment of sales strategies, in fiscal year 2016 in our early discovery business to expedite this process. demand for our in vivo discovery services continued to increase in fiscal year 2016, and we acquired agilux laboratories, inc. (agilux) in september 2016 to strengthen our bioanalytical services offering, and reinforce the linkage between our discovery and safety assessment capabilities.
demand for research models and services improved modestly in fiscal year 2016. we remain confident in the long-term drivers of this business because research models and services remain essential tools for our clients' drug discovery and early-stage development efforts.
acquisitions we continued to make strategic acquisitions designed to expand our portfolio of services to support the drug discovery and early-stage development continuum and position us as a market leader in the outsourced discovery services market. fiscal year 2016 acquisitions included:
•   on april 4, 2016, we acquired wil research, a provider of safety assessment and contract development and manufacturing (cdmo) services to biopharmaceutical and agricultural and industrial chemical companies worldwide. the acquisition enhanced our position as a leading global early-stage cro by strengthening our ability to partner with clients across the drug discovery and development continuum. the purchase price for wil research was $604.8 million, including assumed liabilities of $0.4 million, and was funded by cash on hand and borrowings on our amended credit facility.
•   on june 27, 2016, we acquired blue stream, an analytical cro supporting the development of complex biologics and biosimilars. combining blue stream with our existing discovery, safety assessment, and biologics capabilities creates a leading provider with the ability to support biologic and biosimilar development from characterization through clinical testing and commercialization. the purchase price for blue stream was $11.7 million, including $3.0 million in contingent consideration, and was subject to certain customary adjustments. the acquisition was funded by borrowings on our revolving credit facility.
•   on september 28, 2016, we acquired agilux, a cro that provides a suite of integrated discovery small and large molecule bioanalytical services, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic (dmpk) services, and pharmacology services. the acquisition supports our strategy to offer clients a broader, integrated portfolio that provides services continuously from the earliest stages of drug research through the nonclinical development process. the purchase price for agilux was $64.9 million in cash and was funded by borrowings on our revolving credit facility.
segment reporting we report our performance in three reportable segments: research models and services (rms), discovery and safety assessment (dsa), and manufacturing support (manufacturing). we aggregate our operating segments into a reportable segment if (a) they have similar economic characteristics; (b) they are similar in the in the nature of the products or services, nature of the production process, type or class of customer for their products and services, methods used to distribute their products and services and nature of the regulatory environment; and (c) the aggregation helps users better understand our performance.
in the second quarter of 2016, we acquired wil research. wil research's safety assessment business is reported in our dsa reportable segment and its cdmo business created a new operating segment, contract manufacturing, that is reported as part of our manufacturing reportable segment. on february 10, 2017, we divested the cdmo business. in addition, amounts due to changes in our market strategy for certain services and resulting information provided to the chief operating decision maker were reclassified from our rms reportable segment to our manufacturing reportable segment, including revenue of $2.8 million and $3.7 million for fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively, and operating income of $0.5 million and $0.6 million for fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively.
we reported segment results on this basis for all periods presented in this annual report on form 10-k.
31
the revised reportable segments are as follows:
research models and services   discovery and safety assessment   manufacturing support research models                discovery services                microbial solutions research model services        safety assessment                 avian biologics contract manufacturing our rms segment includes the research models and research model services businesses. research models includes the commercial production and sale of small research models, as well as the supply of large research models. research model services includes three business units: genetically engineered models and services (gems), which performs contract breeding and other services associated with genetically engineered research models; research animal diagnostic services (rads), which provides health monitoring and diagnostics services related to research models; and is, which provides management of our clients' research operations (including recruitment, training, staffing, and management services). our dsa segment includes services required to take a drug through the early development process including discovery services, which are non-regulated services to assist clients with the identification, screening, and selection of a lead compound for drug development, and regulated and non-regulated safety assessment services. our manufacturing segment includes microbial solutions, which includes in vitro (non-animal) lot-release testing products and microbial detection, conventional and rapid quality control testing of sterile and non-sterile biopharmaceutical and consumer products, and species identification services; biologics, which performs specialized testing of biologics; avian vaccine services (avian), which supplies specific-pathogen-free fertile chicken eggs and chickens; and contract manufacturing, which, until we divested this business on february 10, 2017, specialized in formulation design and development, manufacturing, and analytical and stability testing for small molecules.
fiscal quarters our fiscal year is typically based on 52-weeks, with each quarter composed of 13 weeks ending on the last saturday on, or closest to, march 31, june 30, september 30, and december 31. a 53rd week was included in fiscal year 2016, which is occasionally necessary to align with a december 31 calendar year-end. the additional week was included in the fourth quarter.
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states (u.s.). the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods and related disclosures. these estimates and assumptions are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. we base our estimates on our historical experience, trends in the industry, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe that our application of the following accounting policies, each of which require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1, "description of business and summary of significant accounting policies", to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8, "financial statements and other supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.
we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements:
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been provided, our price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
service revenue is generally evidenced by client contracts, which range in duration from a few weeks to a few years and typically take the form of an agreed upon rate per unit or fixed fee arrangements. such contracts typically do not contain acceptance provisions based upon the achievement of certain study or laboratory testing results. revenue of agreed upon rate per unit contracts is recognized as services are performed, based upon rates specified in the contract. in cases where
32
performance spans reporting periods, revenue of fixed fee contracts is recognized as services are performed, measured on the ratio of outputs or performance obligations completed to the total contractual outputs or performance obligations to be provided. changes in estimated effort to complete the fixed fee contract are reflected in the period in which the change becomes known. changes in scope of work are common, especially under long-term contracts, and generally result in a change in contract value. once the parties have agreed to the changes in scope and renegotiated pricing terms, the contract value is amended and revenue is typically recognized as described above.
most contracts are terminable by the client, either immediately or upon notice. these contracts often require payment to us of expenses to wind down the project, fees earned to date or, in some cases, a termination fee. such payments are included in revenues when earned.
we recognize product revenue, net of allowances for estimated returns, rebates and discounts, when title and risk of loss pass to customers. when we sell equipment with specified acceptance criteria, we assess our ability to meet the acceptance criteria in order to determine the timing of revenue recognition. we would defer revenue until completion of customer acceptance testing if we are not able to demonstrate the ability to meet such acceptance criteria.
a portion of our revenue is from multiple-element arrangements that include multiple products and/or services as deliverables in a single arrangement, with each deliverable, or a combination of the deliverables, representing a separate unit of accounting. we allocate revenues to each element in a multiple-element arrangement based upon the relative selling price of each deliverable. revenue allocated to each deliverable is then recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met. judgments as to the identification of deliverables, units of accounting, the allocation of consideration to the deliverable, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical with respect to these arrangements.
at the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive. this evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a) the consideration is commensurate with either (1) our performance to achieve the milestone, or (2) the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone; (b) the consideration relates solely to past performance; and (c) the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. we evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone, the level of effort and investment required, and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment. if a substantive milestone is achieved and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured, we recognize revenue related to the milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved. if we were to achieve milestones that we consider substantive under any of our revenue arrangements, we may experience significant fluctuations in our revenue from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on the timing of achieving such substantive milestones. in those circumstances where a milestone is not substantive, we recognize as revenue, on the date the milestone is achieved, an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the performance period that had elapsed as of the date the milestone was achieved, with the balance being deferred and recognized over the remaining period of performance. as of december 31, 2016, we had no significant milestones that were deemed substantive.
the company records shipping charges billed to customers in total revenue and records shipping costs in cost of revenue (excluding amortization of intangible assets) for all periods presented.
income taxes we prepare and file income tax returns based on our interpretation of each jurisdiction's tax laws and regulations. in preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. in performing this assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. in making this determination, under the applicable financial accounting standards, we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and the effects of tax planning strategies. in the event that actual results differ from our estimates, we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.
we account for uncertain tax positions using a "more-likely-than-not" threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions. we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors, that include, but are not limited
33
to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, information obtained during in process audit activities and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. we adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions. our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations, the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the "more-likely-than-not" threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the controversy process. we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures, including all appeals and administrative reviews; we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position; and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would re-examine the related tax position. we also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
as of december 31, 2016, our non-u.s. subsidiaries' undistributed foreign earnings included in consolidated retained earnings were $704.6 million. as of the end of fiscal year 2016, our policy with respect to the undistributed earnings of our non-u.s. subsidiaries is to maintain an indefinite reinvestment assertion as they are required to fund needs outside of the u.s. and cannot be repatriated in a manner that is substantially tax-free. this assertion is made on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis and takes into account the liquidity requirements in both the u.s. and our foreign subsidiaries. if we decide to repatriate funds to the u.s. in the future to execute our growth initiatives or to fund any other liquidity needs, the resulting tax consequences could negatively impact our results of operations through a higher effective tax rate and dilution of our earnings. on december 18, 2015, the u.s. enacted the consolidated appropriations act, which reinstated and extended the controlled foreign corporation look-through rules through the fiscal year 2019. this rule allows us to access chinese and canadian cash in a more tax-efficient manner and utilize the cash outside of the u.s. without triggering residual u.s. tax. as such, we are accruing foreign withholding taxes to reflect this change for the years in which the rules are reinstated.
goodwill and intangible assets we use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. the determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of our acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. we utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques, such as the income approach and the cost approach, as appropriate, in establishing the fair value of intangible assets. typically, key assumptions include projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses as well as discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets.
we review definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset.
during fiscal year 2016, we determined that the carrying values of certain dsa intangible assets were not recoverable and recorded an impairment charge of $1.9 million, which was included in costs of services provided (excluding amortization of intangible assets).
we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually, during the fourth quarter, and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. different assumptions from those made in our analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and our evaluation of goodwill for impairment.
we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. if we elect this option and believe, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the carrying value of goodwill is not recoverable, the quantitative two-step impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. alternatively, we may elect to not first assess qualitative factors and immediately perform the quantitative two-step impairment test. in the first step, we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. if the carrying values of the net assets assigned to the reporting units exceed the fair values of the reporting units, then the second step
34
of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of our goodwill. if the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference.
in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, we performed the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test for our reporting units. fair value was determined by using a weighted combination of a market-based approach and an income approach, as this combination was deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. under the market-based approach, we utilized information about our company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples that are used to value our reporting units. under the income approach, we determined fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.
our 2016, 2015 and 2014 impairment tests indicated that goodwill was not impaired.
in the second quarter of 2016, we revised the composition of our reportable segments to align with the view of the business following our acquisition of wil research. see note 1, "description of business and summary of significant accounting policies." as a result, goodwill was allocated from our rms reportable segment to our manufacturing reportable segment based on the fair value of each business group within its original reporting unit relative to the fair value of that reporting unit. in addition, we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all reporting units immediately prior to the reallocation and determined that no impairment existed.
valuation and impairment of long-lived assets long-lived assets to be held and used, including property, plant, and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable. factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, the following:
•   significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;
•   significant negative industry or economic trends; or
•   significant changes or developments in strategy or operations that negatively affect the utilization of our long-lived assets.
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset, net of any sublease income, if applicable, and its eventual disposition. in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written-down to their fair values. we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model. significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows, including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. we may also estimate fair value based on market prices for similar assets, as appropriate. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets.
pension and other post-retirement benefit plans several of our u.s. and non-u.s. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. we recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability. this amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. we measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of our fiscal year end.
the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the expected return on plan assets, withdrawal and mortality rates, discount rate, and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. assumptions are determined based on our data and appropriate market indicators, and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement date. should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation.
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. in determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we consider the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance.
35
the discount rate reflects the rate we would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle our current pension obligations.
the rate of compensation increase reflects the expected annual salary increases for the plan participants based on historical experience and the current employee compensation strategy.
in fiscal year 2016, new mortality improvement scales were issued in the u.s. reflecting a decline in longevity projection from the 2015 releases that we adopted, which decreased our benefit obligations by $1.3 million as of december 31, 2016. in fiscal year 2015, new mortality improvement scales were issued in the u.s. and the united kingdom (u.k.) reflecting a decline in longevity projection from the 2014 releases that we adopted, which decreased our benefit obligations by $3.3 million as of december 26, 2015.
stock-based compensation we grant stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance share units (psus) to employees, and stock options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units to non-employee directors under stock-based compensation plans. we make certain assumptions in order to value and record expense associated with awards made under our stock-based compensation arrangements. changes in these assumptions may lead to variability with respect to the timing and amount of expense we recognize in connection with share-based payments.
determining the appropriate valuation model and related assumptions requires judgment. the fair value of stock options granted is calculated using the black-scholes model and the fair value of psus is calculated using a lattice model with a monte carlo simulation, both of which require the use of subjective assumptions including volatility and expected term, among others.
determining the appropriate amount to expense based on the anticipated achievement of psu's performance targets requires judgment, including forecasting the achievement of future financial targets. the estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets. the cumulative impact of any changes to our estimates is reflected in the period of change.
we also estimate forfeitures over the requisite service period when recognizing share-based compensation expense based on historical rates and forward looking factors; these estimates are adjusted to the extent that actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to materially differ, from our estimates.

interest expense interest expense for fiscal year 2016 was $27.7 million, an increase of $12.6 million, or 83.8%, compared to $15.1 million for fiscal year 2015. the increase was primarily due to the write-off of a portion of debt issuance costs in connection with the modification of our $1.3b credit facility, a higher average debt balance outstanding as a result of business
39
acquisitions, a higher average interest rate as a result of a higher leverage ratio, and an increased interest expense related to capital leases.
other income (expense), net other income (expense), net, was a net other income of $11.9 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $8.9 million, or 295.5%, compared to a net other income of $3.0 million for fiscal year 2015. the increase in other income (expense), net was driven by the absence of an expense of $10.4 million due to a reversal of the indemnification asset associated with a previous acquisition in the corresponding period in 2015; an increase of $6.5 million in gains on our venture capital investments accounted for under the equity method; a higher net gain of $2.1 million on life insurance policy investments; a $0.7 million gain on remeasurement of previously held equity interest in an entity acquired in a step acquisition; and an increase of $0.6 million in other activity; partially offset by the absence of a bargain purchase gain of $9.9 million associated with the acquisition of sunrise in may 2015; and a $1.5 million charge recorded in connection with the modification of the option to purchase the remaining 13% equity interest in vital river.
income taxes income tax expense was $66.8 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $23.4 million, compared to $43.4 million for fiscal year 2015. our effective tax rate was 30.0% in the fiscal year 2016, compared to 22.2% in the fiscal year 2015. the increase was primarily driven by non-deductible expenses associated with acquisitions and restructurings. in addition, we recognized a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of $10.4 million due to the expiration of the statute of limitations associated with pre-acquisition tax positions on the forgiveness of debt and a non-taxable bargain purchase gain of $9.9 million associated with the acquisition of sunrise in the fiscal year 2015.

the increase in unallocated corporate sg&a of $19.1 million was related to an increase of $7.3 million in stock-based compensation, primarily related to our annual stock-based grants made in the first quarter of 2015, which included a new retirement vesting provision and the modification of certain stock-based awards as part of executive retirement transitions; an increase of $7.3 million in costs associated with the evaluation and integration of acquisitions and compensation costs related to business acquisitions; an increase of $2.2 million in compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses; an increase of $2.0 million in external consulting and other service expenses; an increase of $1.9 million in information technology related expenses; and an increase of $0.4 million in other expenses; partially offset by a decrease of $2.0 million in contingent consideration related to business acquisitions.
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangibles for fiscal year 2015 was $24.2 million, a decrease of $1.8 million, or 6.7%, from $26.0 million for fiscal year 2014, due primarily to certain intangibles acquired in connection with several discovery services and safety assessment businesses becoming fully amortized and the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase due to recent acquisitions, primarily argenta, biofocus, chantest, sunrise, celsis and oncotest.
interest income interest income, which represents earnings on held cash, cash equivalents, and time deposits, was $1.0 million for fiscal year 2015, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 9.4%, compared to $1.2 million for fiscal year 2014.
interest expense interest expense for fiscal year 2015 was $15.1 million, an increase of $3.1 million, or 26.1%, compared to $12.0 million for fiscal year 2014. the increase was due primarily to the write-off of a portion of debt issuance costs in connection with the modification of our $970m credit facility in april 2015, interest expense related to new capital leases, and overall higher average debt due to additional borrowings related to business acquisitions.
other income (expense), net other income (expense), net was net other income of $3.0 million for fiscal year 2015, a decrease of $7.7 million, or 71.9%, compared to net other income of $10.7 million for fiscal year 2014. the decrease in other
42
income (expense), net was driven by a decrease of $10.4 million due to a reversal of the indemnification asset associated with a pre-acquisition tax position and corresponding unrecognized tax benefit; a decrease of $5.5 million in income from our venture capital investments accounted for under the equity method; and the absence of a noncash gain of $2.1 million related to assets assumed at our frederick, maryland, facility following the termination of a customer contract, which was recorded in fiscal year 2014; partially offset by a bargain purchase gain of $9.8 million associated with the acquisition of sunrise and an increase of $0.5 million from other activity.
income taxes income tax expense was $43.4 million in fiscal year 2015, a decrease of $4.3 million compared to $47.7 million for fiscal year 2014. our effective tax rate was 22.2% in fiscal year 2015, compared to 26.8% in fiscal year 2014. the decrease was primarily attributable to a $10.4 million reduction in unrecognized tax benefits and related interest due to the expiration of the statute of limitations associated with pre-acquisition tax positions on the forgiveness of debt and a non-taxable bargain purchase gain of $9.8 million associated with the acquisition of sunrise. these benefits were offset by a tax accrual of $6.6 million of withholding taxes in order to access cash from our canadian and chinese operations for use outside of the u.s.
liquidity and capital resources we currently require cash to fund our working capital needs, pension obligations, capital expansion, acquisitions, and to pay our debt obligations. our principal sources of liquidity have been our cash flows from operations, supplemented by long-term borrowings. based on our current business plan, we believe that our existing funds, when combined with cash generated from operations and our access to financing resources, are sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future.

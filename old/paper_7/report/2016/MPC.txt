corporate overview we are an independent petroleum refining and marketing, retail and midstream company. overall, we are one of the largest independent petroleum product refining, marketing, retail and transportation businesses in the united states and the largest east of the mississippi.
we currently own and operate seven refineries, all located in the united states, with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.8 mmbpcd. our refineries supply refined products to resellers and consumers within our market areas, including the midwest, northeast, east coast, southeast and gulf coast regions of the united states. we distribute refined products to our customers through one of the largest terminal operations in the united states and a combination of mpc-owned and third-party-owned trucking and rail assets. we are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers within our market area.
we have two strong retail brands: speedway® and marathon®. we believe that speedway llc, a wholly-owned subsidiary, operates the second largest chain of company-owned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the united states, with approximately 2,730 convenience stores in 21 states throughout the midwest, east coast and southeast. the marathon brand is an established motor fuel brand in the midwest and southeast regions of the united states, and is available through approximately 5,500 retail outlets operated by independent entrepreneurs in 19 states.
through our ownership interests in mplx and its wholly-owned subsidiary, markwest, we are one of the largest processors of natural gas in the united states, the largest processor and fractionator in the marcellus and utica shale regions and we distribute refined products through one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges. our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas and ngls from some of the largest supply basins in the united states to domestic and international markets. our midstream gathering and processing operations include: natural gas gathering, processing and transportation; and ngl gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing. our assets include approximately 7,500 mmcf/d of natural gas processing capacity and 500 mbpd of fractionation capacity as of december 31, 2016. we also own 5,600 miles of gas gathering and ngl pipelines and have ownership interests in more than 50 gas processing plants, more than 10 ngl fractionation facilities and two condensate stabilization facilities. as of december 31, 2016, we owned, leased or had ownership interests in approximately 8,400 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas.
we revised our operating segment presentation in the first quarter of 2016 in connection with the contribution of our inland marine business to mplx. in previous periods, our inland marine business and our investment in an ocean vessel joint venture, crowley ocean partners, were presented within our refining & marketing segment. they are now presented in our midstream segment. comparable prior period information has been recast to reflect our revised segment presentation. we plan additional dropdowns of mlp-qualifying assets to mplx in 2017 and would expect changes to our segment reporting in connection with these transactions.
our operations consist of three reportable operating segments: refining & marketing; speedway; and midstream. each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services they offer. see item 1. business for additional information on our segments.
•   refining &amp; marketing - refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our seven refineries in the gulf coast and midwest regions of the united states, purchases refined products and ethanol for resale and distributes refined products through various means, including terminals and trucks that we own or operate. we sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, buyers on the spot market, our speedway business segment and to independent entrepreneurs who operate marathon® retail outlets.
50
•   speedway - sells transportation fuels and convenience products in the retail market in the midwest, east coast and southeast.
•   midstream - includes the operations of mplx and certain other related operations. the midstream segment gathers, processes and transports natural gas; gathers, transports, fractionates, stores and markets ngls and transports and stores crude oil and refined products.
strategic actions to enhance shareholder value on january 3, 2017, we announced plans to significantly accelerate the dropdown of assets with an estimated $1.4 billion of mlp-eligible annual ebitda to mplx now expected to be completed in 2017, subject to requisite approvals and regulatory clearances, including tax clearance, and market and other conditions. we expect these dropdowns to be valued consistent with recent industry precedent valuation multiples ranging between 7.0x and 9.0x ebitda, subject to the mplx conflicts committee review process and receipt of customary fairness opinions. we also expect mplx to finance the dropdown transactions with debt and equity in approximately equal proportions in the aggregate for all planned dropdowns of assets. the equity financing is expected to be funded through mplx common units issued to us. in conjunction with the completion of the dropdowns, we also expect to exchange our economic interests in the general partner of mplx, including incentive distribution rights, for newly issued mplx common units. additionally, a special committee of our board of directors, with the assistance of an independent financial advisor, will conduct a full and thorough review of speedway to ensure optimum value is being delivered to shareholders over the long term. we expect to provide an update on the review by mid-2017. this significant acceleration of dropdowns and other announced strategic actions are designed to further highlight the substantial value embedded in our integrated businesses.
executive summary results select results for 2016 and 2015 are reflected in the following table.
(in millions, except per share data)   2016                                                    2015
income from operations by segment refining &amp; marketing                                             $1,543              $4,086

items not allocated to segments                                        (770   )            (447   )
total                                                                $2,378              $4,692
net income attributable to mpc                                       $1,174              $2,852
net income attributable to mpc per diluted share                      $2.21               $5.26
net income attributable to mpc decreased $1.68 billion, or $3.05 per diluted share, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to reduced results from our refining & marketing segment.
refining & marketing segment income from operations decreased in 2016 compared to 2015. segment income in 2015 includes a $345 million non-cash charge related to the company's lcm inventory reserve. due to increased refined product prices in 2016, this inventory reserve was completely reversed resulting in a non-cash benefit to segment income of $345 million. the favorable lcm inventory adjustment variance was more than offset by the unfavorable effects of lower crack spreads and higher direct operating costs due to refinery turnarounds.
speedway segment income from operations increased in 2016 compared to 2015. segment income in 2015 includes a $25 million non-cash charge related to the company's lcm inventory reserve. due to increased refined product prices in 2016, this inventory reserve was completely reversed resulting in a non-cash benefit to segment income of $25 million. in addition to the favorable lcm inventory adjustment variance, the remaining increase during the year was primarily due to higher merchandise gross margin and gains from asset sales, partially offset by lower gasoline and distillate gross margins.
midstream segment income from operations increased in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the inclusion of markwest's operating results following the merger with mplx on december 4, 2015 (as discussed below), as well as earnings from new and existing pipeline and marine equity investments.
51
items not allocated to segments in 2016 includes non-cash impairment charges totaling $486 million, which included $267 million related to our equity method investment in the sandpiper pipeline project resulting from the indefinite deferral of this project, $130 million related to the goodwill recognized in connection with the markwest merger and $89 million related to an mplx equity method investment. items not allocated to segments in 2015 includes an impairment charge of $144 million related to the cancellation of the roux project.
mplx lp mplx is a diversified, growth-oriented publicly traded master limited partnership originally formed by us to own, operate, develop and acquire midstream energy infrastructure assets. mplx is engaged in the gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas; the gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing of ngls; and the gathering, transportation and storage of crude oil and refined petroleum products. on december 4, 2015, mplx merged with markwest, whereby markwest became a wholly-owned subsidiary of mplx. markwest is engaged in the gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas and the gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing of ngls.
as of december 31, 2016, we owned a 25.5 percent interest in mplx, including a two percent general partner interest. this ownership percentage reflects the conversion of the mplx class b units in july 2017 at 1.09 to 1.00. mplx is a vie because the limited partners of mplx do not have substantive kick-out or substantive participating rights over the general partner. we are the primary beneficiary of mplx because in addition to significant economic interest, we also have the power, through our 100 percent ownership of the general partner, to control the decisions that most significantly impact mplx. we therefore consolidate mplx and record a noncontrolling interest for the 74.5 percent interest owned by the public. the components of our noncontrolling interest consist of equity-based noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest. the redeemable noncontrolling interest relates to mplx's preferred units, discussed below.
the creditors of mplx do not have recourse to mpc's general credit through guarantees or other financial arrangements. the assets of mplx are the property of mplx and cannot be used to satisfy the obligations of mpc.
dropdowns to mplx on march 1, 2014, we sold mplx a 13 percent interest in mplx pipe line holdings llc ("pipe line holdings") for $310 million. mplx financed this transaction with $40 million of cash on-hand and $270 million of borrowings on its bank revolving credit facility.
on december 1, 2014, we sold and contributed interests in pipe line holdings totaling 30.5 percent to mplx for $600 million in cash and 2.9 million mplx common units valued at $200 million. mplx financed the sales portion of this transaction with $600 million of borrowings on its bank revolving credit facility.
on december 4, 2015, we sold our remaining 0.5 percent interest in pipe line holdings to mplx for $12 million. as a result, mplx now owns 100 percent of pipe line holdings.
the sales and contribution of our interests in pipe line holdings to mplx resulted in a change of our ownership in pipe line holdings, but not a change in control. we accounted for these sales as transactions between entities under common control and did not record a gain or loss.
on march 31, 2016, we contributed our inland marine business to mplx in exchange for 23 million common units and 460 thousand general partner units. the number of units we received from mplx was determined by dividing $600 million by the volume weighted average nyse price of mplx common units for the 10 trading days preceding march 14, 2016, pursuant to the membership interests contribution agreement. we also agreed to waive first-quarter 2016 common unit distributions, idrs and general partner distributions with respect to the common units issued in this transaction. the contribution of our inland marine business was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control and we did not record a gain or loss.
on december 5, 2016, our board of directors authorized us to offer up to 100 percent of mplx terminals llc ("mplx terminals"), hardin street transportation llc ("hardin street transportation") and woodhaven cavern llc ("woodhaven cavern") to mplx. mplx terminals owns and operates light products terminals. hardin street transportation owns and operates various private crude oil and refined product pipeline systems and associated storage tanks. woodhaven cavern owns and operates butane and propane storage caverns. the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017, pending requisite approvals.
52
reorganization transactions on september 1, 2016, mpc, mplx and various affiliates initiated a series of reorganization transactions in order to simplify mplx's ownership structure and its financial and tax reporting. in connection with these transactions, mpc contributed $225 million to mplx, and all of the issued and outstanding mplx class a units, all of which were held by markwest hydrocarbon, a wholly-owned subsidiary of mplx, were exchanged for newly issued common units representing limited partner interests in mplx. the simple average of the closing prices of mplx common units for the last 10 trading days prior to september 1, 2016 was used for purposes of these transactions. as a result of these transactions, mpc increased its ownership interest in mplx by 7 million mplx common units, or approximately 1 percent.
private placement of preferred units on may 13, 2016, mplx completed the private placement of approximately 30.8 million 6.5 percent series a convertible preferred units (the "mplx preferred units") at a cash price of $32.50 per unit. the aggregate net proceeds of approximately $984 million from the sale of the mplx preferred units was used for capital expenditures, repayment of debt and general partnership purposes.
the mplx preferred units rank senior to all mplx common units with respect to distributions and rights upon liquidation. the holders of the mplx preferred units are entitled to receive quarterly distributions equal to $0.528125 per unit commencing for the quarter ended june 30, 2016, with a prorated amount from the date of issuance. following the second anniversary of the issuance of the mplx preferred units, the holders of the mplx preferred units will receive as a distribution the greater of $0.528125 per unit or the amount of per unit distributions paid to common units. the mplx preferred units are convertible into mplx common units on a one for one basis after three years, at the purchasers' option, and after four years at mplx's option, subject to certain conditions.
the mplx preferred units are considered redeemable securities due to the existence of redemption provisions upon a deemed liquidation event which is considered outside our control. therefore they are presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheets. we have recorded the mplx preferred units at fair value as of their issuance date, net of issuance costs. since the mplx preferred units are not currently redeemable and not probable of becoming redeemable in the future, adjustment to the initial carrying amount is not necessary and would only be required if it becomes probable that the security would become redeemable.
public offerings on december 8, 2014, mplx completed a public offering of 3.5 million common units at a price to the public of $66.68 per mplx common unit, with net proceeds of $221 million. mplx used the net proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings under its bank revolving credit facility and for general partnership purposes.
on february 12, 2015, mplx completed an underwritten public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of four percent unsecured senior notes due february 15, 2025 (the "senior notes"). the senior notes were offered at a price to the public of 99.64 percent of par. the net proceeds of this offering were used to for general corporate purposes, including dropdowns.
on february 10, 2017, mplx completed a public offering of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.125% unsecured senior notes due march 2027 (the "mplx 2027 senior notes") and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.200% unsecured senior notes due march 2047 (the "mplx 2047 senior notes"). mplx intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for general partnership purposes, which may include, from time to time, acquisitions (including the previously announced planned dropdown of assets from mpc) and capital expenditures.
atm program on august 4, 2016, mplx entered into a second amended and restated distribution agreement (the "distribution agreement") providing for the continuous issuance of common units, in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of any offerings (such continuous offering program, or at-the-market program, referred to as the "atm program"). mplx expects to use the net proceeds from sales under the atm program for general partnership purposes including repayment of debt and funding for acquisitions, working capital requirements and capital expenditures.
during 2016, mplx issued an aggregate of 26 million common units under the atm program, generating net proceeds of approximately $776 million. as of december 31, 2016, $717 million of common units remains available for issuance through the atm program under the distribution agreement.
53
distributions from mplx the following table summarizes the cash distributions we received from mplx during 2016 and 2015.
(in millions)            2016                                              2015
cash distributions received from mplx:
general partner distributions, including idrs        $190               $21
limited partner distributions                         142                97
total                                                $332              $118
the market value of the 86.6 million mplx common units we owned at december 31, 2016 was $3.0 billion based on the december 31, 2016 closing unit price of $34.62. as mentioned in the strategic actions to enhance shareholder value section above, we believe there is substantial value in our economic interests in the general partner of mplx and expect to exchange these economic interests for newly issued mplx common units in conjunction with completion of our dropdowns to highlight and capture that value.
on january 25, 2017, mplx declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.52 per common unit, which was payable february 14, 2017. as a result, mplx made distributions totaling $243 million to its limited and general partners. mpc's portion of this distribution was approximately $102 million, $57 million for its general partner interests including idrs and $45 million for its limited partner units.
see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 4 for additional information on mplx.
acquisitions and investments on february 13, 2017, mplx announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement with enbridge pipelines (ozark) llc ("enbridge ozark"), under which an affiliate of pipe line holdings has agreed to purchase the ozark pipeline for approximately $220 million from enbridge ozark. the ozark pipeline is a 433-mile, 22-inch crude oil pipeline originating in cushing, oklahoma, and terminating in wood river, illinois, capable of transporting approximately 230 mbpd. the purchase transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.
on february 6, 2017, mplx announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, markwest, and antero midstream partners l.p. ("antero midstream") formed a strategic joint venture to support the development of antero resources corporation's extensive marcellus shale acreage in the prolific rich-gas corridor of west virginia. in connection with this transaction, markwest contributed approximately $134 million of assets currently under construction at the sherwood complex and antero midstream made an initial capital contribution of approximately $154 million.
in the fourth quarter of 2016, speedway and pilot flying j finalized the formation of a joint venture consisting of 123 travel plazas, primarily in the southeast united states. the new entity, pfj southeast, consisted of 41 existing locations contributed by speedway and 82 locations contributed by pilot flying j, all of which carry either the pilot or flying j brand and are operated by pilot flying j. our non-cash contribution was $272 million based on the book value of the assets we contributed to the joint venture.
on september 1, 2016, enbridge energy partners announced that its affiliate, north dakota pipeline, would withdraw certain pending regulatory applications for the sandpiper pipeline project and that the project would be deferred indefinitely. these decisions were considered to indicate an impairment of the costs capitalized to date on the project. we made contributions of $14 million to north dakota pipeline during the year ended december 31, 2016 and have contributed $301 million since project inception to fund our share of the construction costs for the project. as the operator of north dakota pipeline, which owns the investments made to date in the sandpiper pipeline project, and the entity responsible for maintaining its financial records, enbridge energy partners completed a fixed asset impairment analysis as of august 31, 2016, in accordance with asc topic 360, to determine the fixed asset impairment charge. based on the estimated liquidation value of the fixed assets, an impairment charge was recorded by north dakota pipeline. based on our 37.5 percent ownership of north dakota pipeline, we recognized approximately $267 million of this charge in the third quarter of 2016 through "income (loss) from equity method investments" on the accompanying consolidated statements of income. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 17 to the for information regarding the charge.
54
on february 15, 2017, mplx closed on the previously announced transaction to acquire a partial, indirect equity interest in the dapl and etcop projects, collectively referred to as the bakken pipeline system, through a joint venture with enbridge energy partners. mplx contributed $500 million of the $2 billion purchase price paid by the joint venture to acquire a 36.75 percent indirect equity interest in the bakken pipeline system from etp and sxl. mplx holds, through a subsidiary, a 25 percent interest in the joint venture, which equates to an approximate 9.2 percent indirect equity interest in the bakken pipeline system. the bakken pipeline system is currently expected to deliver in excess of 470 mbpd of crude oil from the bakken/three forks production area in north dakota to the midwest through patoka, illinois and ultimately to the gulf coast. furthermore, mpc expects to become a committed shipper on the bakken pipeline system under terms of an on-going open season.
in connection with closing the transaction with etp and sxl, enbridge energy partners canceled mpc's transportation services agreement with respect to the sandpiper pipeline project and released mpc from paying any termination fee per that agreement.
we currently have indirect ownership interests in two ocean vessel joint ventures with crowley, which were established to own and operate jones act vessels in petroleum product service. we have invested a total of $189 million in these two ventures as described further below.
in september 2015, we acquired a 50 percent ownership interest in a joint venture, crowley ocean partners, with crowley. the joint venture owns and operates four new jones act product tankers, three of which are leased to mpc. two of the vessels were delivered in 2015 and the remaining two were delivered in 2016. during 2016, we contributed $69 million in connection with the delivery of the third and fourth vessels. we have contributed a total of $141 million for the four vessels.
in may 2016, mpc and crowley formed a new ocean vessel joint venture, crowley coastal partners, in which mpc has a 50 percent ownership interest. mpc and crowley each contributed their 50 percent ownership in crowley ocean partners, discussed above, into crowley coastal partners. in addition, we contributed $48 million in cash and crowley contributed its 100 percent ownership interest in crowley blue water partners to crowley coastal partners. crowley blue water partners is an entity that owns and operates three 750 series atb vessels that are leased to mpc. we account for our 50 percent interest in crowley coastal partners as part of our midstream segment using the equity method of accounting.
see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 6 for additional information on crowley coastal partners as a vie and note 25 for information regarding our conditional guarantee of the indebtedness of crowley ocean partners and crowley blue water partners.
on december 4, 2015, mplx merged with markwest, whereby markwest became a wholly-owned subsidiary of mplx. each common unit of markwest issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the markwest merger was converted into a right to receive 1.09 common units of mplx representing limited partner interests in mplx, plus a one-time cash payment of $6.20 per unit. each class b unit of markwest outstanding immediately prior to the merger was converted into the right to receive one class b unit of mplx having substantially similar rights, including conversion and registration rights, and obligations the class b units of markwest had immediately prior to the merger. at closing, we contributed $1.23 billion in cash to mplx to pay the cash consideration to markwest common unitholders. we will contribute an additional total of $50 million in cash to mplx for the cash consideration to be paid upon the conversion of the mplx class b units to mplx common units in equal installments, the first $25 million of which was paid in july 2016 and the second $25 million of which will be paid in july 2017. these contributions are with respect to mpc's existing interests in mplx (including idrs) and not in consideration of new units or other equity interest in mplx. we assigned the total consideration transferred of $8.61 billion, including the $7.33 billion fair value of the equity consideration and the $1.28 billion of cash contributions, to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities and noncontrolling interest assumed in the markwest merger, with the excess recorded as goodwill. during the first quarter of 2016, the preliminary fair value measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed recorded in the 2015 year-end financial statements were revised based on additional analysis. these adjustments to the fair values of property, plant and equipment, intangibles and equity investments, among other items, resulted in an offsetting reduction to goodwill of approximately $241 million. as a result, we recognized total assets acquired of $11.91 billion, including $8.52 billion of property plant and equipment and $2.60 billion of equity investments, and total liabilities and noncontrolling interests assumed of $5.51 billion, including $4.57 billion of assumed debt. goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if warranted due to events or changes in circumstances.
55
mplx recorded an impairment charge of approximately $129 million in the first quarter of 2016 to impair a portion of the $2.21 billion of goodwill, as adjusted, recorded in connection with the markwest merger. in the second quarter of 2016, mplx completed its purchase price allocation, which resulted in an additional $1 million of impairment expense that would have been recorded in the first quarter of 2016 had the purchase price allocation been completed as of that date. this adjustment to the impairment expense was the result of completing an evaluation of the deferred tax liabilities associated with the markwest merger and their impact on the resulting goodwill that was recognized. see the critical accounting estimates - impairment assessments of long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill and equity investments section for a discussion of recent circumstances which may impact the assessment of this goodwill. our financial results and operating statistics reflect the results of markwest operations from the date of the acquisition in the midstream segment.
consistent with our strategy to grow our midstream business, the markwest merger combines one of the nation's largest processors of natural gas and the largest processor and fractionator in the marcellus and utica shale regions with a rapidly growing crude oil and refined products logistics partnership sponsored by mpc. the complementary aspects of the highly diverse asset base of markwest, mplx and mpc provide significant additional opportunities across multiple segments of the hydrocarbon value chain. the combined entity will further markwest's leading midstream presence in the marcellus and utica shales by allowing it to pursue additional midstream projects, which should allow producer customers to achieve superior value for their growing production in these important shale regions.
on september 30, 2014, we acquired from hess all of its retail locations, transport operations and shipper history on various pipelines, including approximately 40 mbpd on colonial pipeline, for $2.82 billion. we refer to these assets as "hess' retail operations and related assets" and substantially all of these assets are part of our speedway segment. this acquisition significantly expanded our speedway presence from nine to 22 states throughout the east coast and southeast consistent with our strategy to grow higher-valued, more stable cash flow businesses. this acquisition also enables us to further leverage our integrated refining and transportation operations, providing an outlet for assured sales from our refining system. the transaction was funded with a combination of debt and available cash. our financial results and operating statistics reflect the results for hess' retail operations and related assets in our speedway segment from the date of the acquisition.
in july 2014, we exercised our option to acquire a 35 percent ownership interest in enbridge inc.'s sax pipeline which runs from flanagan, illinois to patoka, illinois. this option resulted from our agreement to be the anchor shipper on the sax pipeline. during 2016, we made contributions of $32 million to illinois extension pipeline to fund our portion of the construction costs for the sax project. we have contributed $299 million since project inception. the pipeline became operational in december 2015. our investment in the pipeline is included in our midstream segment.
in march 2014, we acquired from chevron raven ridge pipe line company an additional seven percent interest in explorer for $77 million, bringing our ownership interest to 25 percent. due to this increase in our ownership percentage, we now account for our investment in explorer using the equity method of accounting as part of our midstream segment and report explorer as a related party. explorer owns approximately 1,900 miles of refined products pipeline from port arthur, texas to hammond, indiana.
see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 5 for additional information on these acquisitions and investments.

overview of segments refining & marketing refining & marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our refining & marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs.
our refining & marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale. the crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. as a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate midwest (chicago) and usgc crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. lls prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of lls crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline, 2 barrels of ultra-low sulfur diesel and 1 barrel of three percent residual fuel oil) are used for these crack-spread calculations.
our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. the amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our refining & marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude oil. in general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our refining & marketing gross margin.
future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors, as well as u.s. energy policy.
the following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions.

(b)   lls (prompt) - [delivered cost of sour crude oil: arab light, kuwait, maya, western canadian select and mars].
(c)   assumes approximately 20 percent of crude oil throughput volumes are wti-based domestic crude oil.
(d)   this is consumption based exposure for our refining &amp; marketing segment and does not include the sales exposure for our midstream segment.
in addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sweet/sour differential and the lls to wti differential, our refining & marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as:
•   the selling prices realized for refined products;
•   the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed;
•   our refinery yields;
•   the cost of products purchased for resale;
•   the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk; and
57
•   the potential impact of lcm adjustments to inventories in periods of declining prices.
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. costs of crude oil, refinery feedstocks and refined products are stated under the lifo inventory costing method and aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values. at december 31, 2015, costs of inventories on a consolidated basis exceeded market value resulting in an lcm charge to cost of revenues of $370 million, of which $345 million was allocated to our refining & marketing segment. as of june 30, 2016, market value exceeded cost and we reversed the lcm inventory reserve resulting in a benefit to cost of revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016. at december 31, 2016, market values for refined products continue to exceed their cost basis and, therefore, there is no lcm inventory market valuation reserve at the end of the year. based on movements of refined product prices, future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings. such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover.
refining & marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refinery direct operating costs, which include turnaround and major maintenance, depreciation and amortization and other manufacturing expenses. changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. the following table lists the refineries that had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities for each of the last three years.

speedway our retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillate, which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, impacts the speedway segment profitability. gasoline and distillate prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in supply and demand. numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand throughout the year, including local competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions. padd 2 estimated 2016 gasoline demand grew for the fourth consecutive year to a record level, up 1.8 percent year over year in 2016, and 1.2 percent above the former record set in 2006. continuing economic growth and year-on-year declines in prices supported gasoline demand in most of the u.s., more than offsetting fleet fuel efficiency gains. estimated gasoline demand in padd 1, however, posted a small decline of 0.1 percent year over year in 2016 as prices increased year over year in the last four months of the year-exacerbated by colonial pipeline disruptions in september and late october. distillate demand in 2016 faced enormous headwinds as a much warmer than normal first quarter suppressed heating oil demand and rail traffic (total carloads and intermodal) fell to a six-year low for the year. padd 1 estimated 2016 distillate demand was down 5.8 percent year over year to a four year low, pulled down by a first quarter that was down nearly 15 percent year over year. padd 2 distillate demand is estimated down 2.0 percent year over year, also a four year low. the gross margin on merchandise sold at our convenience stores historically has been less volatile and has contributed substantially to speedway's gross margin. more than
58
half of speedway's gross margin was derived from merchandise sales in 2016. speedway's convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise, including prepared foods, beverages and non-food items.
inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value. costs of crude oil, refinery feedstocks and refined products are stated under the lifo inventory costing method and aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values. as of december 31, 2015, costs of inventories on a consolidated basis exceeded market value resulting in an lcm charge to cost of revenues of $370 million, of which $25 million was allocated to our speedway segment. as of june 30, 2016, market value exceeded cost and we reversed the lcm inventory reserve resulting in a benefit to cost of revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016. as of december 31, 2016, market values for refined products continue to exceed their cost basis and, therefore, there is no lcm inventory market valuation reserve at the end of the year. based on movements of refined product prices, future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings. such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover.
midstream ngl and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand, as well as market uncertainty, availability of ngl transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors. our midstream segment profitability is affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at our own or third‐party processing plants, purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‐related prices and the cost of third‐party transportation and fractionation services. to the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling volumes by our producer customers, such prices also affect midstream segment profitability.
the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations included in our midstream segment, primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. a majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common carrier pipelines serve our refining & marketing segment. the volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines. key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. the volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines. in most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from may through september of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. as with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements.

net income attributable to mpc decreased $1.68 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $328 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to our refining & marketing segment income from operations, which decreased $2.54 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $548 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the decrease in income from operations in 2016 for our refining & marketing segment was partially offset by increases in our midstream and speedway segments. income from operations for 2016 includes a non-cash benefit of $370 million related to the reversal of the company's lcm inventory valuation reserve and impairment charges of $356 million related to equity method investments and $130 million recorded by mplx to impair a portion of the $2.21 billion of goodwill recorded in connection with the markwest merger. income from operations for 2015 includes a non-cash $370 million lcm inventory valuation charge and an impairment charge of $144 million. see segment results for additional information.
sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) decreased $8.71 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 and $25.77 billion in 2015 compared to 2014. the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower refined product sales prices and sales volumes. the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to lower refined product sales prices, partially offset by increases in refined product sales volumes. mpc consolidated refined product sales decreased 32 mbpd in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased 163 mbpd in 2015 compared to 2014.
income (loss) from equity method investments decreased $273 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and $65 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to impairment charges related to equity method investments of $356 million, partially offset by increases in income from new and existing pipeline and marine equity investments.the
60
decrease in 2015 was primarily due to decreases in income from our ethanol affiliates of $69 million, mainly due to lower ethanol prices.
net gain on disposal of assets increased $25 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and decreased $14 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to the sale of certain speedway locations during the year. the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to the sale of two terminals and related terminal assets in 2014.
other income increased $66 million in 2016 compared to 2015. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of markwest other income and increased rin sales. other income in 2015 was comparable to 2014.
cost of revenues decreased $6.41 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 and $28.19 billion in 2015 compared to 2014. the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to:
•   a decrease in refined product cost of sales of $6.52 billion, primarily due to a decrease in our average crude oil costs of $7.26 per barrel; partially offset by
•   an increase in refinery direct operating costs of $407 million, or $0.72 per barrel of total refinery throughput, primarily due to significantly higher turnaround activity in 2016 as compared to a lower than normal level of turnaround costs in 2015.
the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to:
•   a decrease in refined product cost of sales of $28.67 billion, primarily due to a decrease in our average crude oil costs of $43.97 per barrel, partially offset by an increase in refined product sales volumes; and
•   decreases in refinery direct operating costs of $726 million, or $1.40 per barrel of total refinery throughput, primarily due to significantly lower turnaround activity in 2015 and decreases in other manufacturing costs.
purchases from related parties increased $201 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and decreased $197 million in 2015 compared 2014. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to:
•   increases in volumes transported by illinois extension pipeline, which is a pipeline affiliate that became operational in december of 2015, of $106 million;
•   increases in transportation services provided by crowley ocean partners, which is a new marine joint venture established in september of 2015, of $46 million; and
•   increases in transportation services provided by crowley blue water partners, which is a new marine joint venture established in may of 2016, of $37 million.
the decrease in purchases from related parties in 2015 was primarily due to decreases in prices and volumes of ethanol purchases from the andersons marathon ethanol llc, the andersons clymers ethanol llc and the andersons albion ethanol llc, our affiliated ethanol operations, of $149 million, decreases in purchases from loop of $36 million and explorer of $19 million.
inventory market valuation adjustment decreased costs and expenses by $740 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased costs and expenses by $370 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the lcm inventory reserve recorded in 2015 of $370 million was reversed in 2016 due to increases in refined product prices during the second quarter of 2016 resulting in reductions to cost of revenues of $370 million in 2016.
consumer excise taxes decreased $186 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $1.01 billion in 2015 compared to 2014. the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in taxable refined product sales volumes and tax rates in certain jurisdictions. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to increases in taxable refined product sales volumes, including the effects of the acquisition of hess' retail operations and related assets.
impairment expense decreased $14 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $144 million in 2015 compared to 2014. impairment expense in 2016 reflects a $130 million charge recorded by mplx to impair a portion of the $2.21 billion of goodwill recorded in connection with the markwest merger. in 2015, an impairment charge of $144 million was recorded related to the cancellation of the roux project at our garyville refinery. impairments related to equity method investments were recorded to income (loss) from equity method investments and discussed above.
61
depreciation and amortization increased $499 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and $176 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to the depreciation of the fair value of the assets acquired in connection with the markwest merger. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to the depreciation of the fair value of the assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of hess' retail operations and related assets.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $29 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and $201 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to the inclusion of markwest expenses, largely offset by decreases in contract services and other selling, general and administrative expenses. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to increases in employee benefit costs, contract services and additional expenses related to the convenience stores acquired from hess along the east coast and southeast, partially offset by a decrease in pension settlement expenses.
other taxes increased $44 million in 2016 compared to 2015. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to the inclusion of markwest's taxes. other taxes in 2015 were comparable to 2014.
net interest and other financial costs increased $238 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and $102 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to interest on the debt assumed in the markwest merger. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to senior notes issued by mpc in september 2014 to finance the acquisition of hess' retail operations and related assets, higher levels of borrowings on mplx's bank revolving credit facility used to fund the acquisition of pipe line holdings and interest on the debt assumed from markwest. we capitalized interest of $63 million in 2016, $37 million in 2015 and $27 million in 2014. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 19 for further details.
provision for income taxes decreased $897 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $226 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to changes in our income before income taxes, which decreased $2.55 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $539 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the effective tax rates of 33 percent, 34 percent and 33 percent in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, are slightly less than the u.s. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent benefit differences, including the domestic manufacturing deduction, partially offset by state and local tax expense. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 12 for further details.

refining & marketing segment income from operations decreased $2.54 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $548 million in 2015 compared to 2014. segment income in 2015 includes a $345 million non-cash charge related to the company's lcm inventory reserve, which was reversed in 2016 due to increased refined product prices, resulting in a non-cash benefit to segment income of $345 million. the favorable lcm inventory adjustment variance was more than offset by the unfavorable effects of lower crack spreads and higher direct operating costs due to refinery turnarounds. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to higher crack spreads, favorable effects of changes in market structure on crude oil acquisition prices, more favorable net product price realizations compared to spot market reference prices and lower direct operating costs. these favorable impacts were partially offset by higher crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to benchmark lls crude oil, the unfavorable effect of lower commodity prices on volumetric gains and an lcm inventory valuation charge of $345 million.

based on the market indicators above and our refinery throughputs, we estimate the following impacts on refining & marketing segment income from operations for 2016 compared to 2015 and for 2015 compared to 2014:
•   the usgc lls 6-3-2-1 crack spread decreased $2.31 per barrel in 2016 compared to 2015 which had a negative impact on segment income of $1.13 billion and increased $1.88 per barrel in 2015 compared to 2014 which had a positive impact on segment income of $940 million.
•   the chicago lls 6-3-2-1 crack spread decreased $3.48 per barrel in 2016 compared to 2015 which had a negative impact on segment income of $846 million and increased $1.11 per barrel in 2015 compared to 2014 which had a positive impact on segment income of $400 million.
•   the sweet/sour crude oil differential increased $0.42 per barrel in 2016 compared to 2015 which had a positive impact on segment income of $334 million and narrowed $0.87 per barrel in 2015 compared to 2014 which had a negative impact on segment income of $27 million.
•   the lls-wti crude oil differential narrowed $2.04 per barrel in 2016 compared to 2015 resulting in a negative impact on segment income of $260 million. the lls-wti crude oil differential narrowed $0.40 per barrel in 2015 compared to 2014. this decrease was more than offset by an increase in volume of wti resulting in a positive impact on segment income of $6 million.
the market indicators shown above use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales. differences in our results compared to these market indicators, including product price realizations, the mix of crudes purchased and their costs, the effects of lcm inventory valuation adjustments, the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices, and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, had an estimated negative impact on refining & marketing segment income of $304 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and $1.03 billion in 2015 compared to 2014. the significant elements of the negative impact for 2016 were unfavorable product price realizations and unfavorable crude acquisition costs relative to the market indicators, partially offset by the reversal of the company's lcm inventory valuation reserve that was recorded in 2015. the significant elements of the negative impact for 2015 were unfavorable crude oil acquisition costs relative to the market indicators, the unfavorable effect of lower commodity prices on volumetric gains, the price differential of charge and blend stock relative to crude oil and the lcm inventory valuation charge, partially offset by the effects of changes in market structure on our crude oil acquisition costs and product price realizations.
the cost of inventories of crude oil and refinery feedstocks, refined products and merchandise is determined primarily under the lifo method. in the second quarter of 2016, we had recognized the the effects of an interim liquidation of our refined products inventories which we did not expect to reinstate by year end resulting in a pre-tax charge of approximately $54 million to income. based on year end refined product inventories, which were higher than inventories at the beginning of the year, we had a build in refined product inventories for 2016. therefore, we recognized the effects of this annual build in our refined products in the fourth quarter of 2016 which had the effect of reversing the second quarter charge. in the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a lifo charge of $45 million as a result of annual decreased levels in refined products and crude inventory volumes. since the lifo costs for these inventory layers were based on 2014 costs, the liquidation resulted in a charge to income. in the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized annual builds in our refined product and crude inventories. these builds were based on january 2014 costs which were significantly higher than fourth quarter 2014 costs resulting in a benefit of approximately $240 million to income. for the full year, we recognized a lifo charge of $2 million in 2016 and $78 million in 2015 as compared to a lifo benefit of $265 million in 2014.

refinery direct operating costs increased $0.72 per barrel in 2016 compared to 2015 and decreased $1.40 per barrel in 2015 compared to 2014. these changes in 2016 compared to 2015 and 2015 compared to 2014 include an increase in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs of $0.70 per barrel and a decrease of $0.67 per barrel, respectively, as well as decreases in other manufacturing costs of $0.06 per barrel and $0.71, respectively. the increase in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs for 2016 are primarily attributable to higher turnaround activity at the galveston bay, garyville and robinson refineries and a lower than normal schedule of turnaround activity in 2015, partially offset by a decrease in turnaround activity at the catlettsburg refinery. the decrease in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs for 2015 was primarily attributable to lower turnaround activity at the galveston bay, robinson and garyville refineries, partially offset by an increase in turnaround activity at the detroit refinery. in 2016, the decrease in other manufacturing costs was primarily due to lower routine maintenance costs, general and administrative expenses and waste costs. in 2015, the decrease in other manufacturing costs was primarily attributable to lower energy costs and routine maintenance costs.
we purchase rins to satisfy a portion of our rfs2 compliance. our expenses associated with purchased rins were $288 million in 2016, $212 million in 2015 and $141 million in 2014. in 2015, we recorded a $46 million charge to recognize increased estimated costs for compliance based on the renewable fuel standards for 2014 and 2015 proposed by the epa in may 2015 and finalized in november 2015, particularly those for biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuels. excluding this charge, the increases in both years were primarily due to the effect of increased purchases of biomass-based diesel rins at increased prices. in 2015, this increase was partially offset by decreased purchases of ethanol rins at decreased prices.
speedway segment income from operations increased $61 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and $129 million in 2015 compared to 2014. segment income in 2015 includes a $25 million non-cash charge related to the company's lcm inventory reserve, which was reversed in 2016 due to increased refined product prices, resulting in a non-cash benefit to segment income of $25 million. in addition to the favorable lcm inventory adjustment variance, the remaining increase during the year was primarily due to higher merchandise gross margin of $67 million and gains from asset sales, partially offset by lower gasoline and distillate gross margin of $91 million, or $0.0167 per gallon. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to an increases in our gasoline and distillate gross margin of $401 million and our merchandise gross margin of $393 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses. the increase in 2015 was primarily attributable the full year effect of the acquisition of hess' retail operations and related assets on september 30, 2014. the increases in merchandise gross margin in both years were related to a combination of higher merchandise and food sales and improved margins.

midstream segment income from operations increased $491 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and $38 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to the inclusion of markwest's operating results following the merger with mplx, as well as earnings from new and existing pipeline and marine equity investments. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to the inclusion of the financial results of markwest, which are reflected in midstream segment income from the december 4, 2015 markwest merger date, partially offset by $30 million of transaction costs related to the acquisition.
corporate and other unallocated expenses decreased $22 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $22 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the decrease in 2016 is primarily due to increased allocations of corporate costs to the segments. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to a lower allocation of employee benefit costs to the segments.
unallocated items in 2016 also includes impairment charges of $486 million resulting from non-cash charges of $267 million related to the indefinite deferral of the sandpiper pipeline project, $130 million related to the goodwill recognized in connection with the markwest merger and $89 million related to an mplx equity method investment. unallocated items in 2015 includes an impairment charge of $144 million recorded in the third quarter of 2015 related to the cancellation of the roux project at our garyville refinery. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 17 for additional information on the impairment charges.
we recorded pretax pension settlement expenses of $7 million in 2016, $4 million in 2015 and $96 million in 2014 resulting from the level of employee lump sum retirement distributions that occurred during these years.
liquidity and capital resources cash flows our cash and cash equivalents balance was $887 million at december 31, 2016 compared to $1.13 billion at december 31, 2015. net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the past three years is presented in the following table.

net cash provided by operating activities decreased $75 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to decreased operating results, partially offset by favorable changes in working capital of $1.22 billion compared to 2015. net cash provided by operating activities increased $951 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to increased operating results, partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital of $330 million compared to 2014. the above changes in working capital exclude changes in short-term debt.
for 2016, changes in working capital were a net $200 million source of cash, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by increases in current receivables and inventories. changes from december 31, 2015 to december 31, 2016 per the consolidated balance sheets, excluding the impact of acquisitions, were as follows:
•   accounts payable increased $850 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to higher crude oil payable prices.
•   current receivables increased $690 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to higher refined product and crude oil receivable prices.

•   excluding the change in the company's lcm inventory valuation reserve of $370 million, inventories increased $61 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to higher crude oil and refined product inventory volumes.
for 2015, changes in working capital were a net $1.02 billion use of cash, primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by decreases in current receivables and inventories. accounts payable decreased $1.92 billion from year-end 2014, primarily due to lower crude oil payable prices and volumes; current receivables decreased $1.13 billion from year-end 2014, primarily due to lower refined product and crude oil receivable prices and lower crude oil receivable volumes; and inventories decreased $47 million from year-end 2014, excluding a $370 million lcm inventory valuation charge, primarily due to lower refined product and crude oil inventory volumes.
for 2014, changes in working capital were a net $694 million use of cash, primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase in inventories, partially offset by a decrease in current receivables. excluding the impact of acquisitions, accounts payable decreased $1.65 billion from year-end 2013, primarily due to lower crude oil payable prices, partially offset by higher crude oil payable volumes; inventories decreased $796 million from year-end 2013, primarily due to higher refined product and crude oil inventory volumes; and current receivables decreased $1.63 billion from year-end 2013, primarily due to lower refined product and crude oil receivable prices.
cash flows used in investing activities decreased $500 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and $1.10 billion in 2015 compared to 2014. the investing activity is further discussed below.

net investments were a use of cash of $262 million in 2016 compared to $327 million in 2015 and $404 million in 2014. the change in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to decreases in contributions to the sax pipeline project of $114 million, the sandpiper pipeline project of $57 million and crowley ocean partners of $38 million, partially offset by increases in contributions to crowley coastal partners of $82 million and mplx equity method investments of $74 million. the change in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in contributions to the sax pipeline project of $121 million and the 2014 investment in explorer, partially offset by contributions to crowley ocean partners of $72 million.
financing activities were a $1.29 billion use of cash in 2016, a $987 million use of cash in 2015 and a $635 million source of cash in 2014.
long-term debt borrowings and repayments were a net $1.42 billion use of cash in 2016 compared to a $746 million source of cash in 2015 and a $3.22 billion source of cash in 2014. during 2016, mplx used proceeds from its issuance of the mplx preferred units to repay amounts outstanding under the mplx bank revolving credit facility and mpc chose to prepay $500 million under its term loan. during 2015, we used $763 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of $1.5 billion of mpc senior notes to extinguish our obligation for the $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in 2016 and mplx used proceeds from its issuance of $500 million aggregate of principal amount of mplx senior notes to repay $385 million outstanding under the mplx bank revolving credit facility. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 19 for additional information on our long-term debt.
cash proceeds from the issuance of mplx common units were $776 million in 2016 and $221 million in 2014. cash proceeds from the issuance of mplx preferred units was $984 million in 2016. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 4 for further discussion of mplx.
cash used in common stock repurchases totaled $197 million in 2016, $965 million in 2015 and $2.13 billion in 2014 associated with the share repurchase plans authorized by our board of directors. the table below summarizes our total share repurchases. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 9 for further discussion of the share repurchase plans.

because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, including a commercial paper program, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, the repurchase of shares of our common stock, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.
as discussed in the "strategic actions to enhance shareholder value" section in the corporate overview, we expect mplx to finance the planned dropdown transactions with debt and equity in approximately equal proportions in the aggregate for all planned dropdowns of assets. the equity financing will be funded through mplx common units issued to us. in conjunction with the completion of the dropdowns, we also expect to exchange our economic interests in the general partner of mplx, including incentive distribution rights, for newly issued mplx common units. cash proceeds from the dropdowns and ongoing mplx common unit distributions to us are expected to fund the substantial ongoing return of capital to mpc shareholders in a manner consistent with maintaining an investment-grade credit profile.
see discussion of the february 2017 issuance of mplx senior notes due 2027 and 2047 under the mplx lp section of the executive summary.
commercial paper - on february 26, 2016, we established a commercial paper program that allows us to have a maximum of $2 billion in commercial paper outstanding, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. we do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facilities. at december 31, 2016, we had no amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program.
mpc bank revolving credit facility - on july 20, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders to replace our existing mpc bank revolving credit facility due in 2017. the new agreement provides for a four-year $2.5 billion bank revolving credit facility ("four-year revolving credit facility") maturing on july 20, 2020. additionally, we entered into a 364-day $1 billion bank revolving credit facility maturing on july 19, 2017. the financial covenants contained in these agreements remain the same as under the previous bank revolving credit facility.
our four-year revolving credit facility includes letter of credit issuing capacity of up to $2.0 billion and swingline loan capacity of up to $100 million. we may increase our borrowing capacity under our four-year revolving credit facility by up to an additional $500 million, subject to certain conditions including the consent of the lenders whose commitments would be increased. in addition, the maturity date of the four-year revolving credit facility may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods subject to the approval of lenders holding a majority of the commitments then outstanding, provided that the commitments of any non-consenting lenders will terminate on the then-effective maturity date.
there were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding at december 31, 2016.
trade receivables facility - on july 20, 2016, we amended our trade receivables facility to, among other things, reduce the capacity from $1 billion to $750 million and to extend the maturity date to july 19, 2019. the reduction in capacity reflects the lower refined product price environment.
70
as of december 31, 2016, eligible trade receivables supported borrowings of $684 million. there were no borrowings outstanding at december 31, 2016. availability under our trade receivables facility is a function of refined product selling prices.
mplx credit agreement - mplx is party to a credit agreement, dated as of november 20, 2014, and amended as of october 27, 2015 ("mplx credit agreement"), providing for a $2 billion bank revolving credit facility with a maturity date of december 4, 2020 and an outstanding $250 million term loan facility with a maturity date of november 20, 2019.
the mplx credit agreement includes letter of credit issuing capacity of up to $250 million and swingline loan capacity of up to $100 million. the revolving borrowing capacity under the mplx credit agreement may be increased by up to an additional $500 million, subject to certain conditions, including the consent of the lenders whose commitments would increase. in addition, the maturity date of the bank revolving credit facility may be extended from time-to-time during its term to a date that is one year after the then-effective date, subject to the approval of lenders holding the majority of the loans and commitments then outstanding, provided that the commitments of any non-consenting lenders will be terminated on the then-effective maturity date.
the maturity date for the term loan facility may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods subject to the consent of the lenders holding a majority of the outstanding term loan borrowings, provided that the portion of the term loan borrowings held by any non-consenting lenders will continue to be due and payable on the then-effective maturity date.
during 2016, mplx borrowed $434 million under the bank revolving credit facility, at an average interest rate of 1.9 percent, per annum, and repaid $1.31 billion of outstanding borrowings. at december 31, 2016, mplx had no borrowings and $3 million of letters of credit outstanding under the bank revolving credit facility, resulting in total unused loan availability of $2.0 billion.
see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 19 for further discussion of our debt.
the term loan agreement, the mpc bank revolving credit facility and the mplx credit agreement contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types. the financial covenant included in the term loan agreement and the mpc bank revolving credit facility requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of consolidated net debt to total capitalization (as defined in the term loan agreement and the mpc bank revolving credit facility) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. as of december 31, 2016, we were in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of consolidated net debt to total capitalization of 0.31 to 1.00, as well as the other covenants contained in the term loan agreement and the mpc bank revolving credit facility.
the mplx credit agreement includes certain representations and warranties, affirmative and restrictive covenants and events of default that we consider to be usual and customary for an agreement of this type. the mplx credit agreement includes a financial covenant that requires mplx to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter to consolidated ebitda (both as defined in the mplx credit agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of no greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 for up to two fiscal quarters following certain acquisitions). consolidated ebitda is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period. other covenants restrict mplx and certain of its subsidiaries from incurring debt, creating liens on its assets and entering into transactions with affiliates. as of december 31, 2016, mplx was in compliance with the covenants contained in the mplx credit agreement, including a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda of 3.26 to 1.0.
our intention is to maintain an investment-grade credit profile. as of january 31, 2017, the credit ratings on our and mplx's senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows.
company   rating agency           rating mpc       moody's                 baa2 (negative outlook)
standard &amp; poor's   bbb (stable outlook)
fitch                   bbb (negative watch)
mplx      moody's                 baa3 (stable outlook)
standard &amp; poor's   bbb- (stable outlook)
fitch                   bbb- (stable outlook)
the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment-grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.
71
neither the revolving credit facility, the mplx credit agreement nor our trade receivables facility contains credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. however, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment-grade ratings would increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under the revolving credit facility and our trade receivables facility. in addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment-grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables facility, impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services agreements.
debt-to-total-capital ratio our debt-to-total capital ratio (total debt to total debt-plus-equity) was 33 percent and 38 percent at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

redeemable noncontrolling interest - on may 13, 2016, mplx completed the private placement of approximately 30.8 million 6.5 percent series a convertible preferred units (the "mplx preferred units") at a cash price of $32.50 per unit. the mplx preferred units are considered redeemable securities due to the existence of redemption provisions upon a deemed liquidation event which is considered outside mplx's control. therefore they are presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheets. we have recorded the mplx preferred units at their issuance date fair value, net of issuance costs.
mpc senior notes - on december 14, 2015, we completed a public offering of $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes ("mpc senior notes"). the net proceeds from the offering of the mpc senior notes were $1.49 billion, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. we used approximately $763 million of the net proceeds from this offering to fund the extinguishment of our obligation for the $750 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.500% senior notes due 2016.
the mpc senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of ours and rank equally with all our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
mplx and markwest senior notes - in connection with the markwest merger, mplx assumed markwest's outstanding debt, which included $4.1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. on december 22, 2015, approximately $4.04 billion aggregate principal amount of markwest's outstanding senior notes were exchanged for an aggregate principal amount of approximately $4.04 billion of new unsecured senior notes issued by mplx in an exchange offer and consent solicitation undertaken by mplx and markwest.
on february 12, 2015, mplx completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of four percent unsecured senior notes due february 15, 2025. the net proceeds, which were approximately $495 million after deducting underwriting discounts, were used to repay the amounts outstanding under the mplx bank revolving credit facility, as well as for general partnership purposes.
see discussion of the february 2017 issuance of mplx senior notes due 2027 and 2047 under the mplx lp section of the executive summary.
see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 19 for further discussion of our debt.

capital requirements our board approved a 2017 capital spending and investment plan of $1.7 billion for mpc, excluding mplx. mplx's capital investment plan includes $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion of organic growth capital, not including anticipated dropdowns and acquisitions previously discussed or their respective subsequent capital spending, and approximately $100 million of maintenance capital. additional details related to expected 2017 capital spending and investments are discussed in the capital budget outlook section below.
during the second quarter of 2016, we paid bp $200 million for the third period's contingent earnout related to the acquisition of the galveston bay refinery and have paid bp $569 million to-date leaving $131 million remaining under the total cap of $700 million. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 17.
in 2016, we made pension contributions totaling $119 million. we have no required funding for 2017, but may make voluntary contributions at our discretion.
on january 27, 2017, our board of directors approved a $0.36 per share dividend, payable march 10, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on february 16, 2017.
since january 1, 2012, our board of directors has approved $10.0 billion in total share repurchase authorizations and we have repurchased a total of $7.44 billion of our common stock, leaving $2.56 billion available for repurchases as of december 31, 2016. under these authorizations, we have acquired 202 million shares at an average cost per share of $36.77.
we may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be effected through rule 10b5-1 plans. the timing and amount of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including execution of our strategic initiatives, market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.
we may, from time to time, repurchase notes in the open market, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in such volumes, at such prices and upon such other terms as we deem appropriate.
contractual cash obligations the table below provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of december 31, 2016. the contractual obligations detailed below do not include our contractual obligations to mplx under various fee-based commercial agreements as these transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to indemnities and guarantees that are described below. although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on them to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources.
we have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. in conjunction with the spinoff, we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to marathon oil. these arrangements are described in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 25.
capital budget outlook we expect to spend $1.7 billion in 2017 on capital projects and investments, excluding mplx, capitalized interest and acquisitions we may complete. we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.
refining & marketing the refining & marketing segment's forecasted 2017 capital spending and investments is $1.17 billion, which includes approximately $325 million for refining margin enhancement projects and approximately $840 million for refinery-sustaining capital. a number of these projects span multiple years.
the $325 million forecasted for refining margin enhancement projects includes spending for garyville distillate projects, galveston bay export capacity expansion and approximately $85 million for the star project.
the remaining $840 million budget is primarily allocated to maintaining facilities and meeting regulatory requirements, including the epa's tier 3 gasoline fuel standards, at our refineries.
speedway the speedway segment's 2017 capital forecast of approximately $380 million is focused on building new stores and remodeling and rebuilding existing retail locations in its core markets. we have identified numerous opportunities for new convenience stores or store rebuilds in our existing market, with a continued focus in pennsylvania and tennessee, as well as opportunities for growth in new markets including georgia, south carolina and the florida panhandle. we also plan to capitalize on diesel demand growth by building out our network of commercial fueling lane locations, within our core market which cater to local and regional transport fleets.
midstream mplx's capital investment plan includes $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion of organic growth capital, not including anticipated dropdowns and acquisitions previously discussed or their respective subsequent capital spending, and approximately $100 million of maintenance capital. approximately $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion of these growth investments are for the development of natural gas and gas liquids infrastructure to support mplx's producer customers, primarily in the prolific marcellus shale. the remaining $400 million of growth capital is planned for the development of various crude oil and refined petroleum products infrastructure projects, including a build-out of utica shale infrastructure in connection with the recently completed cornerstone pipeline, a butane cavern in robinson, illinois, and a tank farm expansion in texas city, texas.
the midstream segment's forecasted 2017 capital spend, excluding mplx, is approximately $90 million.
corporate and other the 2017 capital forecast includes approximately $100 million to support corporate activities.
our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. if this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors, including cash provided by operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. the discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forward-looking statements regarding expected capital requirements and investment spending, costs for projects under construction, project completion dates and expectations or projections about strategies and goals for growth, upgrades and expansion. the forward-looking statements about our capital and investment budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other
74
factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include our ability to achieve the strategic and other objectives related to the strategic initiatives discussed herein; adverse changes in laws including with respect to tax and regulatory matters; inability to agree with the mplx conflicts committee with respect to the timing of and value attributed to assets identified for dropdown; changes to the expected construction costs and timing of projects; continued/further volatility in and/or degradation of market and industry conditions; the availability and pricing of crude oil and other feedstocks; slower growth in domestic and canadian crude supply; completion of pipeline capacity to areas outside the u.s. midwest; consumer demand for refined products; transportation logistics; the reliability of processing units and other equipment; mpc's ability to successfully implement growth opportunities; modifications to mplx earnings and distribution growth objectives; compliance with federal and state environmental, economic, health and safety, energy and other policies and regulations, including the cost of compliance with the renewable fuel standard, and/or enforcement actions initiated thereunder; changes to mpc's capital budget; other risk factors inherent to mpc's industry; these factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. for additional information on forward-looking statements and risks that can affect our business, see "disclosures regarding forward-looking statements" and item 1a. risk factors in this annual report on form 10-k.
transactions with related parties we believe that transactions with related parties were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 7 for discussion of activity with related parties.
environmental matters and compliance costs we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. if these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. however, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.
legislation and regulations pertaining to fuel specifications, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including costs of compliance and permitting delays. the extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered, the costs and the time frames for compliance, and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers. for additional information see item 1a. risk factors.
our environmental expenditures, including non-regulatory expenditures, for each of the last three years were:

we accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required.
new or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. we believe we comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed.

our environmental capital expenditures accounted for ten percent, nine percent and five percent of capital expenditures excluding the markwest merger and the acquisition of hess' retail operations and related assets in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. our environmental capital expenditures are expected to approximate $422 million, or 12 percent, of total capital expenditures in 2017. predictions beyond 2017 can only be broad-based estimates, which have varied, and will continue to vary, due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements, the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies, among other matters. based on currently identified projects, we anticipate that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately $400 million in 2018; however, actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed.
for more information on environmental regulations that impact us, or could impact us, see item 1. business - environmental matters, item 1a. risk factors and item 3. legal proceedings.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.
fair value estimates fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. there are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach, each of which includes multiple valuation techniques. the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. the income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts. the cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. this is often referred to as current replacement cost. the cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence.
the fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques. these standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques. inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority. the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
•   level 1 - observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date. active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
•   level 2 - observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. these are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date.
•   level 3 - unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management's best estimate of fair value.
valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. the assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy. we use a market or income approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to use the best information available. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 17 for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements.

significant uses of fair value measurements include:
•   assessment of impairment of long-lived assets;
•   assessment of impairment of intangible assets:
•   assessment of impairment of goodwill;
•   assessment of impairment of equity method investments;
•   recorded values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions; and
•   recorded values of derivative instruments.
impairment assessments of long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill and equity method investments fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill and equity method investments for impairment is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate. significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions. significant assumptions include:
•   future margins on products produced and sold. our estimates of future product margins are based on our analysis of various supply and demand factors, which include, among other things, industry-wide capacity, our planned utilization rate, end-user demand, capital expenditures and economic conditions. such estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews.
•   future volumes. our estimates of future refinery, pipeline throughput and natural gas and ngl processing volumes are based on internal forecasts prepared by our refining &amp; marketing and midstream segments operations personnel.
•   discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. we apply a discount rate to our cash flows based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. this discount rate is also compared to recent observable market transactions, if possible. a higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows.
•   future capital requirements. these are based on authorized spending and internal forecasts.
we base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable. however, actual results may differ from these projections.
the need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for products produced, a poor outlook for profitability, a significant reduction in pipeline throughput volumes, a significant reduction in natural gas or ngls processed, a significant reduction in refining margins, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which the asset or equity method investment is located.
long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable based on the expected undiscounted future cash flow of an asset group. for purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is the refinery and associated distribution system level for refining & marketing segment assets, site level for speedway segment convenience stores, and the plant level or pipeline system level for midstream segment assets. if the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group, fair value is calculated, and the carrying value is written down if greater than the calculated fair value.
unlike long-lived assets, goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. we have thirteen reporting units, nine of which have goodwill allocated to them. at december 31, 2016, we had a total of $3.59 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.
based on an interim goodwill impairment test, mplx recorded approximately $130 million of impairment expense related to charges recorded during the first and second quarters of 2016, which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements.
mpc has nine reporting units with goodwill totaling approximately $3.59 billion as of november 30, 2016. step 1 of the annual impairment analysis resulted in the fair value of the reporting units exceeding their carrying value by percentages ranging from approximately 8 percent to 303 percent. the reporting unit with fair value exceeding its carrying value by approximately 8 percent has goodwill of $228 million at december 31, 2016. an increase of 0.50 percent to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge as of november 30, 2016. significant assumptions used to estimate the reporting units' fair value included estimates of future cash flows. if estimates for future cash flows, which are impacted primarily by commodity prices and producers' production plans, were to decline, the overall reporting units' fair value would decrease, resulting in potential goodwill impairment charges. fair value determinations
77
require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. as a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future.
equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value. factors providing evidence of such a loss include the fair value of an investment that is less than its carrying value, absence of an ability to recover the carrying value or the investee's inability to generate income sufficient to justify our carrying value. at december 31, 2016, we had $3.83 billion of investments in equity method investments recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.
an estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions (e.g., pricing, volumes and discount rates) that can materially affect our estimates. that is, unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions.
mplx performed a fixed asset impairment analysis during the second quarter of 2016 for ohio condensate company ("occ") resulting in an impairment charge of $96 million within occ's financial statements. approximately $58 million of the charge was attributable to mplx based on its 60 percent ownership of occ and was recorded in income (loss) from equity method investments on the accompanying consolidated statements of income. furthermore, to determine the potential equity method impairment charge, an impairment analysis in accordance with asc topic 323 was performed during the second quarter resulting in an additional impairment charge of approximately $31 million, recorded in income (loss) from equity method investments on the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
for purposes of the second quarter impairment analysis, the fair value of occ was determined based on applying the discounted cash flow method, which is an income approach, and the guideline public company method, which is a market approach. the significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value under the discounted cash flow method included management's best estimates of the expected results using a probability weighted average set of cash flow forecasts and using a discount rate of 11.2 percent. fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. as such, the fair value of the occ equity method investment and its underlying fixed assets represents a level 3 measurement.
as of december 31, 2016, mplx determined that there were no material events or changes in circumstances that would indicate an other-than-temporary decline in its equity method investments.
during the third quarter of 2016, enbridge energy partners announced that its affiliate, north dakota pipeline, would withdraw certain pending regulatory applications for its sandpiper pipeline project and that the project would be deferred indefinitely. these decisions were considered to indicate an impairment of the costs capitalized to date on the project. as the operator of north dakota pipeline and the entity responsible for maintaining its financial records, enbridge completed a fixed asset impairment analysis as of august 31, 2016, in accordance with asc topic 360. based on the estimated liquidation value of the fixed assets, an impairment charge was recorded by north dakota pipeline. based on our 37.5 percent ownership of north dakota pipeline, we recognized approximately $267 million of this charge in the third quarter of 2016 through "income (loss) from equity method investments" on the accompanying consolidated statements of income which impaired virtually all of our $301 million investment in the project. also, in accordance with asc topic 323, we completed an assessment to determine the potential additional equity method impairment charge to be recorded on our consolidated financial statements resulting from an other-than-temporary impairment. the result of this analysis indicated no additional charge was required to be recorded.
the fixed assets of north dakota pipeline related to the sandpiper pipeline project consist primarily of project management and engineering costs, pipe, valves, motors and other equipment, land and easements. the fair value of fixed assets was estimated based on a market approach using the estimated price that would be received to sell pipe, land and other related equipment in its current condition, considering the current market conditions for sale of these assets and length of disposal period. the valuation considered a range of potential selling prices from various alternatives that could be used to dispose of these assets. as such, the fair value of the north dakota pipeline equity method investment and its underlying assets represents a level 3 measurement. north dakota pipeline expects to dispose of these assets through orderly transactions.
centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 that has continued through 2015. at december 31, 2016, centennial was not shipping product. as a result, we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in centennial. we concluded that no impairment was required given our assessment of its fair value based on market participant assumptions for various potential uses and future cash flows of centennial's assets. if market conditions were to change and the owners of centennial are unable to find an alternative use for the assets, there could be a future impairment of our centennial interest. as of december 31, 2016, our equity investment in centennial was $35 million and we had a $29 million guarantee associated with 50 percent of centennial's outstanding debt. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 25 for additional information on the debt guarantee.
78
the above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to the carrying value of our centennial equity investment. factors that could affect the carrying value of our centennial equity investment include, but are not limited to, a change in business conditions, a further decline or improvement in the long-term outlook of the potential uses of centennial's assets and the pursuit of different strategic alternatives for such assets. these factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
acquisitions in accounting for business combinations, acquired assets, assumed liabilities and contingent consideration are recorded based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. the excess or shortfall of the purchase price when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill or a bargain purchase gain, respectively. a significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, contingent consideration and other assets and liabilities. we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for certain acquisitions, engage third-party consultants for assistance.
the fair value of assets and liabilities, including contingent consideration, as of the acquisition date are often estimated using a combination of approaches, including the income approach, which requires us to project related future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount rate; the cost approach, which requires estimates of replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence estimates; and the market approach which uses market data and adjusts for entity-specific differences. the estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value.
for the customer contract intangibles for our midstream segment, we must estimate the expected life of the relationships with our customers on an individual basis. the estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value.
the fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay to bp is re-measured each quarter using an income approach, with changes in fair value recorded in cost of revenues. the amount of cash to be paid under the arrangement is based on both a market-based crack spread and refinery throughput volumes for the months during which the contract applies, as well as established thresholds that cap the annual and total payment. we used internal and external forecasts for the crack spread and internal forecasts for refinery throughput volumes and applied an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate to the range of cash flows indicated by various scenarios to determine the fair value of the arrangement. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 5 for additional information on our acquisitions. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 17 for additional information on fair value measurements.
derivatives we record all derivative instruments at fair value. substantially all of our commodity derivatives are cleared through exchanges which provide active trading information for identical derivatives and do not require any assumptions in arriving at fair value. fair value estimation for all our derivative instruments is discussed in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 17. additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
variable interest entities we evaluate all legal entities in which we hold an ownership or other pecuniary interest to determine if the entity is a vie. our interests in a vie are referred to as variable interests. variable interests can be contractual, ownership or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the vie's assets. when we conclude that we hold an interest in a vie we must determine if we are the entity's primary beneficiary. a primary beneficiary is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a vie. this controlling financial interest is evidenced by both (a) the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie. we consolidate any vie when we determine that we are the primary beneficiary. we must disclose the nature of any interests in a vie that is not consolidated.
significant judgment is exercised in determining that a legal entity is a vie and in evaluating our interest in a vie. we use primarily a qualitative analysis to determine if an entity is a vie. we evaluate the entity's need for continuing financial support; the equity holder's lack of a controlling financial interest; and/or if an equity holder's voting interests are disproportionate to its obligation to absorb expected losses or receive residual returns. we evaluate our interests in a vie to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary. we use a primarily qualitative analysis to determine if we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in the vie, either on a standalone basis or as part of a related party group. we continually monitor our interests in legal
79
entities for changes in the design or activities of an entity and changes in our interests, including our status as the primary beneficiary to determine if the changes require us to revise our previous conclusions.
mplx is a vie because the limited partners of mplx do not have substantive kick-out or substantive participating rights over the general partner. we are the primary beneficiary of mplx because in addition to significant economic interest, we also have the power, through our 100 percent ownership of the general partner, to control the decisions that most significantly impact mplx. we therefore consolidate mplx and record a noncontrolling interest for the 74.5 percent interest owned by the public.
markwest utica emg, a natural gas and ngl processing joint venture, is a vie; however, we are not considered to be the primary beneficiary. as a result, it is accounted for under the equity method. changes in the design or nature of the activities of this entity, or our involvement with the entity, may require us to reconsider our conclusions on the entity's status as a vie and/or our status as the primary beneficiary. such reconsideration requires significant judgment and understanding of the organization. this could result in the consolidation of the entity which would have a significant impact on our financial statements. ohio gathering is a subsidiary of markwest utica emg and is a vie. if we were to consolidate markwest utica emg, ohio gathering would need to be assessed for consolidation or deconsolidation.
variable interest entities are discussed in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 6 .
pension and other postretirement benefit obligations - to be updated accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following:
•   the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations;
•   the expected long-term return on plan assets;
•   the rate of future increases in compensation levels;
•   health care cost projections; and
•   the mortality table used in determining future plan obligations.
we utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. we have selected different discount rates for our funded pension plans and our unfunded retiree health care plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns. the selected rates are compared to various similar bond indexes for reasonableness. in determining the assumed discount rates, we use our third-party actuary's discount rate model. this model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from aa bond yields. the yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. the bonds used have an average rating of aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and generally only non-callable bonds are included. outlier bonds that have a yield to maturity that deviate significantly from the average yield within each maturity grouping are not included. each issue is required to have at least $250 million par value outstanding.
of the assumptions used to measure the year-end obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. decreasing the discount rates of 3.90 percent for our pension plans and 4.25 percent for our other postretirement benefit plans by 0.25 percent would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by $44 million and $26 million, respectively, and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by $3 million and $1 million, respectively.
the long-term asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (currently targeted at approximately 51 percent equity securities and 49 percent fixed income securities for the primary funded pension plan), past performance and other factors. certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation and returns. in addition, our long-term asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to historical returns for reasonableness. we used the 6.50 percent long-term rate of return to determine our 2016 defined benefit pension expense. after evaluating activity in the capital markets, along with the current and projected plan investments, we did not change the asset rate of return for our primary plan from 6.50 percent effective for 2017. decreasing the 6.50 percent asset rate of return assumption by 0.25 percent would increase our defined benefit pension expense by $4 million.
compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans.
health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends.
we utilized the 2016 mortality tables from the u.s. society of actuaries.

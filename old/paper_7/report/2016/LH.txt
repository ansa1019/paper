item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (in millions)
general net revenues increased 11.0% in comparison to 2015 primarily due to the inclusion of covance's financial results for the entire year as well as solid organic growth and acquisitions, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation.
the company completed several acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2016. the company expects these acquisitions along with the acquisitions that were announced in 2017, prior to the filing of this form 10-k, to increase net revenues by less than 2%, with a comparable increase in operating income.
the company remains on pace to achieve annual cost synergies in excess of $100.0 by december 31, 2017. the company also resumed its share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2016. the company is committed to maintaining its investment grade credit rating and plans to use its operating cash flows to meet its annual capital expenditure requirements and to continue building long-term shareholder value through strategic acquisitions, debt reduction and the return of capital to shareholders.
the company notes that changes to, or repeal of, the affordable care act may continue to affect coverage, reimbursement and utilization of laboratory services, as well as administrative requirements, in ways that are currently unpredictable. further, structural reforms of medicare that could occur under the 115th congress and the new administration, such as imposition of uniform co-insurance and combination of the medicare part a and part b deductibles, could adversely affect laboratory reimbursement under medicare.
the company has seen increases in the amount of its patient accounts receivable. a significant portion of the company's bad debt expense is related to labcorp diagnostics segment accounts receivable from patients. the company believes its current allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to properly record its accounts receivable at their estimated net realizable value. should the shift towards increased patient responsibility continue, the company may need to increase its allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense in future periods.
prior to the first quarter of 2015, the chief operating decision maker (codm) managed the operating results of the company as two segments: commercial laboratory diagnostics and other. in connection with the acquisition, the company changed its operating segments to align with how the codm evaluates financial information used to allocate resources and assess performance of the company following the acquisition. the segment information presented in the company's consolidated financial statements has been conformed to present segments on this revised basis for all prior periods. under the new organizational structure, the codm manages the company under two reportable segments: labcorp diagnostics (lcd) and covance drug development (cdd). lcd includes the company's legacy labcorp business, and the company's nutritional chemistry and food safety business, which was previously part of covance, but excludes labcorp's legacy clinical trials testing business, which is now part of cdd. cdd includes the covance legacy business, and labcorp's legacy clinical trials testing business, but excludes the company's nutritional chemistry and food safety business, which is now part of lcd.
seasonality and external factors the company experiences seasonality in both segments of its business. for example, testing volume generally declines during the year-end holiday period and other major holidays and can also decline due to inclement weather, reducing net revenues, operating margins and cash flows. operations are also impacted by changes in the global economy, exchange rate fluctuations, political and regulatory changes, the progress of ongoing studies and the startup of new studies, as well as the level of expenditures made by the biopharmaceutical industry in r&d. the results of both segments are impacted by exchange rate fluctuations. given the seasonality of the business, comparison of the results for successive quarters may not accurately reflect trends or results for the full year.

the decrease in interest expense for 2016 as compared with the corresponding period in 2015 is primarily due to the reduction of the term loan balance, acquisition-related expenses including a $37.4 make-whole payment that was required in connection with the prepayment of the $250.0 covance senior notes and $15.2 of deferred financing costs associated with the company's previous credit agreement and the bridge financing facilities used to complete the acquisition. in addition, the company repaid the 3.125% senior notes in may 2016. these decreases were offset by $5.6 of interest expense relating to the early retirement of subsidiary indebtedness and the timing of acquisition-related debt.
the increase in interest expense for 2015 as compared with 2014 was primarily due to the issuance of $3,900 in debt and other financing costs in connection with the acquisition. another component of the increase was the $37.4 make-whole payment in connection with the prepayment of covance senior notes and the $15.2 relating to the deferred financing cost associated with the company's previous credit agreement and the bridge financing facility. the bridge facility was repaid in march 2015.

in 2016 and 2015, the company's effective rate was favorably impacted by foreign earnings taxed at lower rates than the u.s. statutory tax rate and, for 2016 specifically, by a reduction in certain foreign rates. the 2016 rate also benefited from the early adoption of share-based payment accounting and the reversal of uncertain tax position reserves. the company considers substantially all of its foreign earnings to be permanently reinvested overseas.
the effective rate for 2015 was unfavorably impacted by restructuring and acquisition items, the recording of additional uncertain tax reserves and a decrease in the benefit recorded from releasing uncertain tax reserves.
51
index the effective rate for 2014 was unfavorably impacted by the recording of a full valuation allowance for the write-down of two of the company's investments.

cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $649.8 compared to $3,184.6 net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2015. this movement in cash within financing activities for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily a result of $3,113.7 of net financing proceeds in 2015 compared to $658.4 in debt repayments combined with $43.9 for the re-initiation of the company's share repurchase program in 2016.
52
index net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2015 was $3,184.6 compared to $200.6 net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2014. the $3,385.2 increase in the cash provided by financing activities for 2015, as compared to the prior year, was primarily a result of $4,360.0 of financing proceeds for the acquisition offset by debt repayments and debt issue costs of $781.7. the company also repaid $500.0 of senior notes (including $250.0 of covance senior notes) in 2015. the remainder of the period-over-period increase was primarily due to the suspension of share repurchases following the acquisition, compared to $269.0 share repurchases for 2014.
on december 19, 2014, the company entered into a five-year term loan facility in the principal amount of $1,000.0 for the purpose of financing a portion of the cash consideration and the fees and expenses in connection with the acquisition. the term loan facility may be prepaid without penalty. the term loan balance was $565.0 and $715.0 at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
on december 19, 2014, the company also entered into an amendment and restatement of its existing senior revolving credit facility, which was originally entered into on december 21, 2011. the senior revolving credit facility consists of a five-year revolving facility in the principal amount of up to $1,000.0, with the option of increasing the facility by up to an additional $250.0, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders to provide such additional amounts and certain other customary conditions. the revolving credit facility also provides for a subfacility of up to $100.0 for swing line borrowings and a subfacility of up to $125.0 for issuances of letters of credit. the revolving credit facility is permitted to be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, funding of share repurchases and certain other payments, and acquisitions and other investments.

on february 13, 2015, the company entered into a 60-day cash bridge term loan credit facility in the principal amount of $400.0 for the purpose of financing a portion of the cash consideration and the fees and expenses in connection with the acquisition. the 60-day cash bridge term loan credit facility was advanced in full on the acquisition date, and was repaid in march 2015.
under its term loan credit facility and its revolving credit facility, the company is subject to negative covenants limiting subsidiary indebtedness and certain other covenants typical for investment grade-rated borrowers and the company is required to maintain a variable leverage ratio. from and after the acquisition date, the leverage ratio was required to be no greater than 4.75 to 1.00 with respect to the last day of each of the first four fiscal quarters ending on or after the closing date, 4.25 to 1.00 with respect to the last day of each of the fifth through eighth fiscal quarters ending after the closing date, and 3.75 to 1.00 with respect to the last day of each fiscal quarter ending thereafter. the company was in compliance with all covenants under the credit facilities at december 31, 2016 and 2015. as of december 31, 2016, the ratio of total debt to consolidated ebitda was 3.1 to 1.0.
the term loan credit facility accrues interest at a per annum rate equal to, at the company's election, either a libor rate plus a margin ranging from 1.125% to 2.00%, or a base rate determined according to a prime rate or federal funds rate plus a margin ranging from 0.125% to 1.00%. advances under the revolving credit facility accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to, at the company's election, either a libor rate plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.60%, or a base rate determined according to a prime rate or federal funds rate plus a margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.60%. fees are payable on outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility at a per annum rate equal to the applicable margin for libor loans, and the company is required to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility, at a per annum rate ranging from 0.125% to 0.40%. the interest margin applicable to the credit facilities, and the facility fee and letter of credit fees payable under the revolving credit facility, are based on the company's senior credit ratings as determined by standard & poor's and moody's, which are currently bbb and baa2, respectively.
as of december 31, 2016, the effective interest rate on the revolving credit facility was 1.9% and the effective interest rate on the term loan was 2.0%.
there was no outstanding balance on the company's revolving credit facility at december 31, 2016 or 2015. as of december 31, 2016, the company provided letters of credit aggregating $54.5, primarily in connection with certain insurance programs. letters of credit provided by the company are issued under the company's revolving credit facility and are renewed annually.

53
index the company had a $28.3 and $36.9 reserve for unrecognized income tax benefits, including interest and penalties as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, respectively. substantially all of these tax reserves are classified in other long-term liabilities in the company's consolidated balance sheets at december 31, 2016 and 2015.
during 2016 and 2015, the company settled notices to convert $59.4 and $1.5 aggregate principal amount at maturity of its zero-coupon subordinated notes with a conversion value of $53.7 and $1.3, respectively. the total cash used for these settlements was $53.7 and $1.3 and the company also issued 0.4 and 0.0 additional shares of common stock, respectively. as a result of these conversions in 2016 and 2015, the company also reversed approximately $4.9 and $0.4, respectively, of deferred tax liability to reflect the tax benefit realized upon issuance of the shares.
on september 12, 2016, the company announced that for the period of september 12, 2016 to march 10, 2017, the zero-coupon subordinated notes will accrue contingent cash interest at a rate of no less than 0.125% of the average market price of a zero-coupon subordinated note for the five trading days ended september 9, 2016, in addition to the continued accrual of the original issue discount.
on january 3, 2017, the company announced that its zero-coupon subordinated notes may be converted into cash and common stock at the conversion rate of 13.4108 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity of the notes, subject to the terms of the zero-coupon subordinated notes and the indenture, dated as of october 24, 2006 between the company and the bank of new york mellon, as trustee and conversion agent. in order to exercise the option to convert all or a portion of the zero-coupon subordinated notes, holders are required to validly surrender their zero-coupon subordinated notes at any time during the calendar quarter beginning january 1, 2017, through the close of business on the last business day of the calendar quarter, which is 5:00 p.m., new york city time, on friday, march 31, 2017. if notices of conversion are received, the company plans to settle the cash portion of the conversion obligation with cash on hand and/or borrowings under the revolving credit facility.
credit ratings the company's debt ratings of baa2 from moody's and bbb from s&p contribute to its ability to access capital markets.

off-balance sheet arrangements the company does not have transactions or relationships with "special purpose" entities, and the company does not have any off-balance sheet financing other than normal operating leases and letters of credit.
54
index other commercial commitments as of december 31, 2016, the company provided letters of credit aggregating approximately $54.5, primarily in connection with certain insurance programs. letters of credit provided by the company are secured by the company's revolving credit facility and are renewed annually.
the contractual value of the noncontrolling interest put in the company's ontario subsidiary totaled $15.2 and $14.9 at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and has been classified as mezzanine equity in the company's consolidated balance sheet.
based on current and projected levels of cash flows from operations, coupled with availability under its revolving credit facility, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet both its anticipated short-term and long-term cash needs; however, the company continually reassesses its liquidity position in light of market conditions and other relevant factors.
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. while the company believes these estimates are reasonable and consistent, they are by their very nature estimates of amounts that will depend on future events. accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates. the company's audit committee periodically reviews the company's significant accounting policies. the company's critical accounting policies arise in conjunction with the following:
•   revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts;
•   pension expense;
•   accruals for self-insurance reserves;
•   income taxes; and
•   goodwill and indefinite-lived assets.
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts lcd recognizes revenue for services rendered when the testing process is complete and test results are reported to the ordering physician. the sales are generally billed to three types of payers - customers, patients and third parties such as mcos, medicare and medicaid.  for customers, sales are recorded on a fee-for-service basis at the company's customer list price, less any negotiated discount. patient sales are recorded at the company's patient fee schedule, net of any discounts negotiated with physicians on behalf of their patients, or fees made available through charity care or an uninsured patient program. lcd bills third-party payers in two ways: fee-for-service and capitated agreements. fee-for-service third-party payers are billed at the company's patient fee schedule amount, and third-party revenue is recorded net of contractual discounts. these discounts are recorded at the transaction level at the time of sale based on a fee schedule that is maintained for each third-party payer. the majority of the company's third-party sales are recorded using an actual or contracted fee schedule at the time of sale. for the remaining third-party sales, estimated fee schedules are maintained for each payer. adjustments to the estimated payment amounts are recorded at the time of final collection and settlement of each transaction as an adjustment to revenue. these adjustments are not material to the company's results of operations in any period presented. the company periodically adjusts these estimated fee schedules based upon historical payment trends. under capitated agreements with mcos, the company recognizes revenue based on a negotiated monthly contractual rate for each member of the managed care plan regardless of the number or cost of the tests performed.
cdd recognizes revenue either as services are performed or products are delivered, depending on the nature of the work contracted. historically, a majority of cdd's net revenues have been earned under contracts that range in duration from a few months to a few years, but can extend in duration up to five years or longer. occasionally, cdd also has committed minimum volume arrangements with certain customers. under these types of arrangements, if the annual minimum dollar value of service commitment is not reached, the customer is required to pay cdd for the shortfall. annual minimum commitment shortfalls are not included in net revenues until the amount has been determined and agreed to by the customer.
service contracts generally take the form of fee-for-service or fixed-price arrangements subject to pricing adjustments based on changes in scope. in cases where performance spans multiple accounting periods, revenue is recognized as services are performed, measured on a proportional-performance basis, generally using output measures that are specific to the service provided. examples of output measures in preclinical services include, among others, the number of slides read, or specimens prepared. examples of output measures in the clinical trials services include, among others, the number of investigators enrolled, the number of sites initiated, the number of trial subjects enrolled and the number of monitoring visits completed, or the number of dosings for clinical pharmacology. revenue is determined by dividing the actual units of work completed by the total units of work required under the contract and multiplying that percentage by the total contract value. the total contract value, or total contractual payments, represents the aggregate contracted price for each of the agreed upon services to be provided. cdd does not have any contractual
55
index arrangements spanning multiple accounting periods where revenue is recognized on a proportional-performance basis under which the company has earned more than an immaterial amount of performance-based revenue (i.e., potential additional revenue tied to specific deliverables or performance). changes in the scope of work are common, especially under long-term contracts, and generally result in a change in contract value. once the customer has agreed to the changes in scope and renegotiated pricing terms, the contract value is amended with revenue recognized as described above. estimates of costs to complete are made to provide, where appropriate, for losses expected on contracts. costs are not deferred in anticipation of contracts being awarded, but instead are expensed as incurred.
billing schedules and payment terms are generally negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. in some cases, cdd bills the customer for the total contract value in progress-based installments as certain non-contingent billing milestones are reached over the contract duration, such as, but not limited to, contract signing, initial dosing, investigator site initiation, patient enrollment or database lock. the term "billing milestone" relates only to a billing trigger in a contract whereby amounts become billable and payable in accordance with a negotiated predetermined billing schedule throughout the term of a project. these billing milestones are generally not performance-based (i.e., there is no potential additional consideration tied to specific deliverables or performance). in other cases, billing and payment terms are tied to the passage of time (e.g., monthly billings). in either case, the total contract value and aggregate amounts billed to the customer would be the same at the end of the project. while cdd attempts to negotiate terms that provide for billing and payment of services prior or within close proximity to the provision of services, this is not always possible, and there are fluctuations in the levels of unbilled services and unearned revenue from period to period. while a project is ongoing, cash payments are not necessarily representative of aggregate revenue earned at any particular point in time, as revenues are recognized when services are provided, while amounts billed and paid are in accordance with the negotiated billing and payment terms.
in some cases, payments received are in excess of revenue recognized. for example, a contract invoicing schedule may provide for an upfront payment of 10% of the full contract value upon contract signing, but at the time of signing performance of services has not yet begun. payments received in advance of services being provided are deferred as unearned revenue on the balance sheet. as the contracted services are subsequently performed and the associated revenue is recognized, the unearned revenue balance is reduced by the amount of revenue recognized during the period.
in other cases, services may be provided and revenue recognized before the customer is invoiced. in these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed, and the difference, representing an unbilled receivable, is recorded for the amount that is currently not billable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms. once the customer is invoiced, the unbilled services are reduced for the amount billed, and a corresponding account receivable is recorded. all unbilled services are billable to customers within one year from the respective balance sheet date.
most contracts are terminable with or without cause by the customer, either immediately or upon notice. these contracts often require payment to cdd of expenses to wind down the study or project, fees earned to date and, in some cases, a termination fee or a payment to cdd of some portion of the fees or profits that could have been earned by cdd under the contract if it had not been terminated early. termination fees are included in net revenues when realization is assured. in connection with the management of multi-site clinical trials, cdd pays on behalf of its customers fees to investigators, clinical trial subjects and certain out-of-pocket costs, for which it is reimbursed at cost, without mark-up or profit. investigator fees are not reflected in net revenues or expenses where cdd acts in the capacity of an agent on behalf of the biopharmaceutical company sponsor, passing through these costs without markup or profit. all other out-of-pocket costs are included in total revenues and expenses.
lcd has a formal process to estimate and review the collectibility of its receivables based on the period of time they have been outstanding. bad debt expense is recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales considered necessary to maintain the allowance for doubtful accounts at an appropriate level. lcd's process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for doubtful accounts involves judgment and considers such factors as the age of the underlying receivables, historical and projected collection experience, and other external factors that could affect the collectibility of its receivables. accounts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts based on lcd's write-off policy (e.g., when they are deemed to be uncollectible).  in the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance, accounts are progressively reserved based on the historical timing of cash collections relative to their respective aging categories within lcd's receivables. these collection and reserve processes, along with the close monitoring of the billing process, help reduce the risks of material revisions to reserve estimates resulting from adverse changes in collection or reimbursement experience.
the following table presents the percentage of lcd's net accounts receivable outstanding by aging category at december 31, 2016 and 2015:
56
index days outstanding    2016   2015
0 - 30   49.1%        46.8%
31 - 60   17.3%        16.9%
61 - 90    9.2%        12.1%
91 - 120    7.5%         7.4%
121 - 150    4.2%         4.4%
151 - 180    3.9%         4.1%
181 - 270    7.4%         7.1%
271 - 360    1.3%         1.1%
over 360    0.1%         0.1%
the above table excludes the percentage of net accounts receivable outstanding by aging category for certain foreign operations, beaconlbs, and the nutritional chemistry and food safety businesses. combined these net accounts receivable balances comprise less than 11.1% of lcd's total net accounts receivable balances. the company believes that including the agings of the accounts receivable for these businesses would not be representative of the majority of accounts receivable by aging category for lcd. the majority of the accounts receivable for the foreign operations, beaconlbs, and the nutritional chemistry and food safety business are generally paid within 30 to 60 days of billing.
cdd endeavors to assess and monitor the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the ordinary course of business. cdd maintains a provision for doubtful accounts relating to amounts due that may not be collected. this bad debt provision is monitored on a monthly basis and adjusted as circumstances warrant. since the recorded bad debt provision is based upon management's judgment, actual bad debt write-offs may be greater or less than the amount recorded. historically, bad debt write-offs have not been material. the allowance for doubtful accounts amounted to $2.8 and $3.4 at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
pension expense the company has a defined benefit retirement plan (company plan) and a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan (pep). in october 2009, the company received approval from its board of directors to freeze any additional service-based credits for any years of service after december 31, 2009 on the company plan and the pep. both plans have been closed to new participants. employees participating in the company plan and the pep no longer earn service-based credits, but continue to earn interest credits. in addition, effective january 1, 2010, all employees eligible for the defined contribution retirement plan (401k plan) receive a minimum 3% non-elective contribution (nec) concurrent with each payroll period. the 401k plan also permits discretionary contributions by the company of up to 1% and up to 3% of pay for eligible employees, based on service.
the company plan covers substantially all employees employed by the company prior to december 31, 2009. the benefits to be paid under the company plan are based on years of credited service through december 31, 2009, interest credits and average compensation. the company's policy is to fund the company plan with at least the minimum amount required by applicable regulations. the pep covers the company's senior management group. prior to 2010, the pep provided for the payment of the difference, if any, between the amount of any maximum limitation on annual benefit payments under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and the annual benefit that would be payable under the company plan but for such limitation. effective january 1, 2010, employees participating in the pep no longer earn service-based credits. the pep is an unfunded plan.
in addition, as a result of the acquisition, the company has a frozen non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan (serp). the serp, which is not funded, is intended to provide retirement benefits for certain employees who were executive officers of covance prior to the acquisition. benefit amounts are based upon years of service and compensation of the participating employees. as a result of the acquisition, the company also sponsors two defined benefit pension plans for the benefit of its employees at two u.k. subsidiaries (u.k. plans) and one defined benefit pension plan for the benefit of its employees at a german subsidiary (german plan), all of which are legacy plans of previously acquired companies and are closed to new entrants. benefit amounts for all three plans are based upon years of service and compensation. the german plan is unfunded while the u.k. plans are funded. the company's funding policy for the u.k. plans has been to contribute annually amounts at least equal to the local statutory funding requirements.
the company's net pension cost is developed from actuarial valuations. inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates and expected return on plan assets, which are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each year. the company is required to consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in making these assumptions. changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. the key assumptions used in accounting for the defined benefit retirement plans were a 4.1% discount rate and a 6.8% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for the company plan, a 4.2% discount rate for the pep, a 3.8% discount rate for the serp, a 1.7% discount rate and a 2.0% expected salary increase for the german plan and a 2.7% discount rate and a 3.8% expected salary increase for the u.k. plans as of december 31, 2016.

index discount rate the company evaluates several approaches toward setting the discount rate assumption that is used to value the benefit obligations of its retirement plans. at year-end, priority was given to use of the towers watson bond:link model, which simulates the purchase of investment-grade corporate bonds at current market yields with principal amounts and maturity dates closely matching the company's projected cash disbursements from its plans. this completed model represents the yields to maturity at which the company could theoretically settle its plan obligations at year end. the weighted-average yield on the modeled bond portfolio is then used to form the discount rate assumption used for each retirement plan. a one percentage point decrease or increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a respective increase or decrease in 2016 retirement plan expense of $1.7 for the company plan and pep. a one percentage point decrease or increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a respective increase or decrease in 2016 retirement plan expense of $2.0 for the u.k. plans.
return on plan assets in establishing its expected return on plan assets assumption, the company reviews its asset allocation and develops return assumptions based on different asset classes adjusting for plan operating expenses. actual asset over/under performance compared to expected returns will respectively decrease/increase unrecognized loss. the change in the unrecognized loss will change amortization cost in upcoming periods. a one percentage point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have resulted in a corresponding change in 2016 pension expense of $2.4 for the company plan. a one percentage point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have resulted in a corresponding change in 2016 pension expense of $1.9 for the u.k. plans.
net pension cost for 2016 was $14.9 as compared with $12.0 in 2015 and $8.1 in 2014. the increase in pension expense was due to increases in the amount of net amortization and deferral as a result of lower discount rates. pension expense for the company plan and the pep is expected to increase to $15.3 in 2017 as a result of a lower assumed discount rate and changes in participant mortality tables. pension expense for the serp is expected to decrease to $0.3 in 2017 as the 2016 expense included settlement accounting charges due to a change in control benefit enhancement provided to one additional executive. pension expense for the germany plan and the u.k. plans is expected to increase to $2.7 in 2017 as a result of a lower assumed discount rate and changes in participant mortality tables.
further information on the company's defined benefit retirement plans is provided in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
accruals for self-insurance reserves accruals for self-insurance reserves (including workers' compensation, auto and employee medical) are determined based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical payment trends and claims history, actuarial assumptions and current and estimated future economic conditions. these estimated liabilities are not discounted.
the company is self-insured (up to certain limits) for professional liability claims arising in the normal course of business, generally related to the testing and reporting of laboratory test results. the company maintains excess insurance which limits the company's maximum exposure on individual claims. the company estimates a liability that represents the ultimate exposure for aggregate losses below those limits. the liability is based on assumptions and factors for known and incurred but not reported claims, including the frequency and payment trends of historical claims.
if actual trends differ from these estimates, the financial results could be impacted. historical trends have not differed materially from these estimates.
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method. under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax loss carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. the company does not recognize a tax benefit, unless the company concludes that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. if the recognition threshold is met, the company recognizes a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that the company believes is greater than 50% likely to be realized. the company records interest and penalties in income tax expense.

index goodwill and indefinite-lived assets the company assesses goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. following the acquisition, the company changed the timing of its annual impairment testing to the beginning of the fourth quarter. in accordance with updates to the fasb's authoritative guidance regarding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing, an entity is allowed to first assess qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing. if an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the estimated fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value, then no further testing is required. otherwise, impairment testing must be performed in accordance with the original accounting standards. the updated fasb guidance also allows an entity to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in its goodwill assessment and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two-step assessment. similarly, a company can proceed directly to a quantitative assessment in the case of impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets as well.
step one of the goodwill impairment test includes the estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit as compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. reporting units are businesses with discrete financial information that is available and reviewed by management. the company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using both income-based and market-based valuation methods. the income-based approach is based on the reporting unit's forecasted future cash flows that are discounted to the present value using the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital. for the market-based approach, the company utilizes a number of factors such as publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of the company as well as operating results, business plans, market multiples, and present value techniques. based upon the range of estimated values developed from the income and market-based methods, the company determines the estimated fair value for the reporting unit. if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required. however, if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the company performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment, if any. the second step involves a hypothetical allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its tangible and intangible assets (excluding goodwill) and liabilities as if the reporting unit were newly acquired, which results in an implied fair value of the goodwill. the amount of the impairment charge is the excess of the recorded goodwill, if any, over the implied fair value of the goodwill.
the income-based fair value methodology requires management's assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which the company operates and conditions in the capital markets, many of which are outside of management's control. at the reporting unit level, fair value estimation requires management's assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific reporting unit, along with assessment of the reporting unit's strategies and forecasts of future cash flows. forecasts of individual reporting unit cash flows involve management's estimates and assumptions regarding:
•   annual cash flows, on a debt-free basis, arising from future revenues and profitability, changes in working capital, capital spending and income taxes for at least a five-year forecast period.
•   a terminal growth rate for years beyond the forecast period. the terminal growth rate is selected based on consideration of growth rates used in the forecast period, historical performance of the reporting unit and economic conditions.
•   a discount rate that reflects the risks inherent in realizing the forecasted cash flows. a discount rate considers the risk-free rate of return on long-term treasury securities, the risk premium associated with investing in equity securities of comparable companies, the beta obtained from the comparable companies and the cost of debt for investment grade issuers. in addition, the discount rate may consider any company-specific risk in achieving the prospective financial information.
under the market-based fair value methodology, judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions. management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of the reporting units.
management concluded that no triggering events occurred during 2016 related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. as such, management performed its annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2016. the company elected to perform the qualitative assessment for goodwill and intangible assets for all reporting units except two of the cdd reporting units and the indefinite-lived canadian licenses for which the quantitative assessment was used.
in the qualitative assessment, the company considered relevant events and circumstances for each reporting unit, including (i) current year results, ii) financial performance versus management's annual and five-year strategic plans, iii) changes in the reporting unit carrying value since prior year, (iv) industry and market conditions in which the reporting unit operates, (v) macroeconomic conditions, including discount rate changes, and (vi) changes in products or services offered by the reporting unit. if applicable, performance in recent years was compared to forecasts included in prior valuations. based on the results of the
59
index qualitative assessment, the company concluded that it was not more likely than not that the carrying values of the goodwill and intangible assets were greater than their fair values, and that further quantitative testing was not necessary.
in 2016, the company utilized an income approach to determine the fair value of two of the cdd reporting units, with $460.7 million and $223.9 million of goodwill as of september 30, 2016. based upon the results of the quantitative assessment, the company concluded that the fair value of these reporting units was greater than the carrying value.
in 2016, the company also utilized an income approach to determine the fair value of its canadian reporting unit and its indefinite-lived assets consisting of acquired canadian licenses. based upon the results of the quantitative assessment, the company concluded that the fair value of the indefinite-lived canadian licenses was greater than the carrying value.
it is possible that the company's conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or intangible assets in any reporting unit could change in future periods. there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in the company's goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing performed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2016 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future, if, for example, (i) the businesses do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in 2017 or future years vary from current assumptions (including changes in discount rates), (iii) business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions, including loss of major customers, (iv) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or (v) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda. the company will particularly monitor the financial performance of and assumptions for two of the cdd reporting units for which an income approach was performed in 2016. a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on the company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements.
overview the company's business the company develops, manufactures, markets and sells a broad range of household, personal care and specialty products.  the company sells its consumer products under a variety of brands through a broad distribution platform that includes supermarkets, mass merchandisers, wholesale clubs, drugstores, convenience stores, home stores, dollar, pet and other specialty stores, and websites, all of which sell the products to consumers.  the company also sells specialty products to industrial customers and distributors.  the company focuses its consumer products marketing efforts principally on its ten "power brands."  these well-recognized brand names include arm & hammer, used in multiple product categories such as baking soda, cat litter, carpet deodorization and laundry detergent; trojan condoms, lubricants and vibrators; oxiclean stain removers, cleaning solutions, laundry detergent, dishwashing detergent and bleach alternatives; spinbrush battery-operated and manual toothbrushes;  first response home pregnancy and ovulation test kits; nair depilatories; orajel oral analgesic; xtra laundry detergent; l'il critters and vitafusion gummy dietary supplements; and batiste dry shampoos.
the company operates its business in three segments: consumer domestic, consumer international and spd.  the consumer domestic segment includes the power brands noted above and other household and personal care products such as scrub free, kaboom and orange glo cleaning products, arrid antiperspirant, close-up and aim toothpastes and simply saline nasal saline moisturizer.  the consumer international segment primarily sells a variety of personal care products, some of which use the same brand names as the company's domestic product lines, in international markets including canada, france, australia, the united kingdom, mexico and brazil.  the spd segment is the largest u.s. producer of sodium bicarbonate, which it sells together with other specialty inorganic chemicals for a variety of industrial, institutional, medical and food applications.  this segment also sells a range of animal nutrition and specialty cleaning products.  in 2016, the consumer domestic, consumer international and spd segments represented approximately 77%, 15% and 8%, respectively, of the company's consolidated net sales.
2016 financial highlights key fiscal year 2016 financial results include:
•   2016 net sales grew 2.9% over fiscal year 2015, with gains in the consumer domestic and consumer international segments, primarily due to volume growth in both the consumer domestic and consumer international segments, helped in part by the january 2016 acquisition of spencer forrest, inc. ("spencer forrest"), the maker of toppik, (the "toppik acquisition"), partially offset by lower sales of animal productivity products.

•   on december 22, 2016, the company completed the anusol acquisition, acquiring the anusol and rectinol businesses from johnson &amp; johnson, inc. for $130. total annual sales for anusol and rectinol were $24 in 2016.

•   gross margin increased 100 basis points to 45.5% in fiscal year 2016 from 44.5% in fiscal year 2015, primarily due to lower manufacturing and commodity costs.

•   operating margin increased 80 basis points to 20.7% in fiscal year 2016 from 19.9% in fiscal year 2015, reflecting a higher gross margin and slightly lower marketing costs, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses ("sg&amp;a").

•   the company reported diluted net earnings per share in fiscal year 2016 of $1.75, an increase of approximately 14.0% from fiscal year 2015 diluted net earnings per share of $1.54.

•   cash provided by operations was $655.3, a $49.2 increase from the prior year, due to higher cash earnings and improved working capital.

•   the company returned $583.0 to its stockholders through dividends and share repurchases.

strategic goals, challenges and initiatives the company's ability to generate sales depends on consumer demand for its products and retail customers' decisions to carry its products, which are, in part, affected by general economic conditions in its markets.  in 2016, many of the markets in which the company operates continued to experience pricing pressures, general economic softness and weak or inconsistent consumer demand.  although the company's consumer products generally are consumer staples and less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products, the continued economic downturn has reduced demand in many categories, particularly those in personal care, and affected company sales in recent periods.  some customers have responded to economic conditions by increasing their private label offerings (primarily in the dietary supplements, diagnostic kits and oral analgesics categories), and consolidating the product selections they offer to the top few leading brands in each category.  in addition, an increasing portion of the company's product categories are being sold by club stores, dollar stores and mass merchandisers.  these customer actions have placed downward pressure on the company's sales and gross margins.
the company expects a competitive marketplace in 2017 due to new product introductions by competitors and continuing aggressive competitive pricing pressures.  in the u.s., an improving unemployment rate and higher disposable income due to low gasoline prices are expected to have a positive effect on consumption patterns.  to continue to deliver attractive results for stockholders in this environment, the company intends to continue to aggressively pursue several key strategic initiatives: maintain competitive marketing and trade spending, tightly control its cost structure, continue to develop and launch new and differentiated products, and pursue strategic acquisitions.  the company also intends to continue to grow its product sales geographically (in an attempt to mitigate the impact of weakness in any one area), and maintain an offering of premium and value brand products (to appeal to a wide range of consumers).
there continues to be significant product and price competition in the laundry detergent category.  for example, p&g markets a lower-priced line of laundry detergents, simply tide, which competes directly with the company's core value laundry detergents. p&g has significantly increased its discounting of simply tide which could have a broad negative impact on the laundry category pricing and profitability.  in addition, in 2016, henkel entered the u.s. market with persil, its leading worldwide premium laundry detergent, and on september 1, 2016 completed its acquisition of sun products, the maker of all, wisk, sun, and private label laundry detergents.  while it is too early to assess what impact this will have on the company's laundry detergent business, the introduction of persil and henkel's increased scale and market share could precipitate greater price competition in the category and distribution pressure with a potential adverse impact on the company's laundry detergent business.   moreover, the unit dose laundry detergent segment is the fastest growing segment in the laundry detergent category, having grown to approximately 16% of the category since its introduction in 2012, and the company faces pressure to achieve its proportionate share of the segment with a potential adverse impact on its share of the laundry detergent category. the company continues to evaluate and vigorously combat these pressures through, among other things, new product introductions and increased marketing and trade spending.  additionally, while the category grew 3.3% for the 52 weeks ended december 17, 2016 and 1.6% for the 52 weeks ended december 19, 2015, after experiencing declines in 2013 and 2014, there is no assurance the category will not decline in the future and that the company will be able to offset any such decline.
the company has responded to these competitive pressures by, among other things, focusing on strengthening its key brands, including increased focus on the arm & hammer, oxiclean, trojan, l'il critters and vitafusion and batiste brands through the launch of innovative new products, which span various product categories, including premium and value household products supported by increased marketing and trade spending.    there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful.
in 2016, the company was able to grow market share in four of 10 of its "power brands" in measured channels.  the company's global product portfolio consists of both premium (60% of total worldwide consumer revenue in 2016) and value (40% of total worldwide consumer revenue in 2016) brands, which it believes enables it to succeed in a range of economic environments.  the company intends to continue to develop a portfolio of appealing new products to build loyalty among cost-conscious consumers.
over the past 16 years, the company has diversified from an almost exclusively u.s. business to a global company with approximately 16% of sales derived from foreign countries in 2016.  the company has operations in six countries (canada, mexico, u.k., france, australia and brazil) and exports to over 90 other countries.  in 2016, the company benefited from its concentration in north america in light of the economic downturn in europe; however, the company has focused and will continue to focus on selectively expanding its global business.  net sales generated outside of the united states are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as political uncertainty which could impact future operating results.
the company also continues to focus on controlling its costs.  historically, the company has been able to mitigate the effects of cost increases primarily by implementing cost reduction programs and, to a lesser extent, by passing along some of these cost

increases to customers.  the company has also entered into set pricing and pre-buying arrangements with certain suppliers and hedge agreements for diesel fuel.  additionally, maintaining tight controls on overhead costs has been a hallmark of the company and has enabled it to effectively navigate recent challenging economic conditions.
the identification and integration of strategic acquisitions are an important component of the company's overall strategy.  acquisitions have added significantly to company sales and profits over the last decade.  this is evidenced by the company's 2015 acquisition of certain assets of varied industries corporation (the "vi-cor acquisition") and 2016 acquisitions of spencer forrest, inc., the maker of toppik, and the anusol and rectinol businesses from johnson & johnson in the anusol acquisition.  however, the failure to effectively integrate any acquisition or achieve expected synergies may cause the company to incur material asset write-downs.  the company actively seeks acquisitions that fit its guidelines, and its strong financial position provides it with flexibility to take advantage of acquisition opportunities.  in addition, the company's ability to quickly integrate acquisitions and leverage existing infrastructure has enabled it to establish a strong track record in making accretive acquisitions. since 2001, the company has acquired nine of its ten "power brands".
the company believes it is positioned to meet the ongoing challenges described above due to its strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on key strategic initiatives: maintaining competitive marketing and trade spending, managing its cost structure, continuing to develop and launch new and differentiated products, and pursuing strategic acquisitions.  this focus, together with the strength of the company's portfolio of premium and value brands, has enabled the company to succeed in a range of economic environments, and is expected to position the company to continue to increase stockholder value over the long-term.  moreover, the generation of a significant amount of cash from operations, as a result of net income and effective working capital management, combined with an investment grade credit rating provides the company with the financial flexibility to pursue acquisitions, drive new product development, make capital expenditures to support organic growth and gross margin improvements, return cash to stockholders through dividends and  share buy backs, and reduce outstanding debt, positioning it to continue to create stockholder value.
for information regarding risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect the company's business, results of operations and financial condition, see "risk factors" in item 1a of this annual report.
recent developments stock split on august 4, 2016, the company announced a two-for-one stock split of the company's common stock ("common stock"). the stock split was structured in the form of a 100% stock dividend, payable on september 1, 2016 to stockholders of record as of august 15, 2016. all applicable amounts in the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.
share repurchase program on november 2, 2016, the board authorized a new share repurchase program, under which the company may repurchase up to $500.0 in shares of common stock (the "2016 share repurchase program").  the 2016 share repurchase program replaced the 2015 share repurchase program and does not have an expiration.  the company will continue its evergreen share repurchase program, under which the company may repurchase, from time to time, common stock to reduce or eliminate dilution associated with issuances of common stock under the company's incentive plans.
toppik acquisition on january 4, 2016, the company acquired spencer forrest, inc., the maker of toppik, the leading brand of hair building fibers for people with thinning hair in the toppik acquisition.  the total purchase price was $175.3.  the company financed the acquisition with short-term borrowings.  this brand is managed within the consumer domestic and consumer international segments.
anusol and rectinol acquisitions on december 22, 2016, the company acquired the anusol and rectinol businesses from johnson & johnson, inc. for $130.  these are the number one or number two hemorrhoid care brands in each market in which they operate, primarily in the u.k., canada, australia and south africa with total annual sales of $24 in 2016.  the acquisition was funded with short-term borrowings and will be managed in the consumer international segment.

viviscal acquisition on january 17, 2017, the company acquired the viviscal business from lifes2good holdings limited for approximately $160.  viviscal is the number one hair care supplement brand both in the u.s. and the u.k. with global annual sales of $44 in 2016.  this brand is complementary to the company's global batiste dry shampoo and toppik hair care business. the acquisition was funded with short-term borrowings and will be managed in the consumer domestic and consumer international segments.
dividend increase on february 7, 2017, the board of directors declared a 7% increase in the regular quarterly dividend from $0.1775 to $0.19 per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $0.76 per share payable to stockholders of record as of february 21, 2017.  the increase raises the annual dividend payout from $183 to approximately $195, and maintains the company's payout of dividends relative to net income at approximately 40%.
brazil's chemical business during fourth quarter of 2016, the company decided to sell its brazilian chemical business to focus on its brazilian consumer business, resulting in a plant impairment charge of $4.9 recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016 based upon an anticipated selling price. during the first quarter of 2017, the company signed an agreement to sell the business, resulting in an approximate $5.0 expense for severance and other charges. sales for the brazilian chemical business in 2016 were approximately $22.0. the company anticipates the transaction to close during the first quarter.
international pension plan termination in 2016 the company authorized the termination of an international defined benefit pension plan under which approximately 336 participants, including 53 active employees, have accrued benefits.  the company anticipates completing the termination of this plan by the end of the second quarter of 2017, once regulatory approvals are obtained.  in addition to plan assets, the company will need to make a one-time payment of $20.0 to $26.0 ($14.0 to $19.0 after tax) to purchase annuities for participants.  the company estimates that it will incur a one-time expense of $49.0 to $55.0 ($40.0 to $45.0 after tax) in 2017 when the plan settlement is completed.  this expense primarily includes the effect of the additional cash payment required at settlement and pension settlement accounting rules which require accelerated recognition of actuarial losses that were to be amortized over the expected benefit lives of participants.  the estimated expense is subject to change based on valuations at the actual date of settlement.  upon the termination of these plans in 2017, the company will have no further obligations with respect to material defined benefit pension plans.

critical accounting policies and estimates the company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (gaap).  the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  by their nature, these judgments are subject to uncertainty.  they are based on the company's historical experience, its observation of trends in industry, information provided by its customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate.  the company's significant accounting policies and estimates are described below.
revenue recognition and promotional and sales return reserves virtually all of the company's revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when received or picked up by the company's customers.  the reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on the company's best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date.  promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives, such as coupons to consumers, and sales incentives provided to customers (such as slotting, cooperative advertising, incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers).  all such costs are netted against sales.  slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer.  cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for the company's products.  discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place.  costs associated with end-aisle or other in-store displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold.  the company relies on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves.  for example, the company uses historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements.  based on the total face value of consumer domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years, if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 0.1% from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements, an approximately $4.1 difference in the reserve required for coupons would result.  with regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns, the company uses experience-based estimates, customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required.  if the company's estimates for promotional activities and sales returns were to change by 10% the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately $6.4.  while management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made, estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations.  during the twelve months ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the company reduced promotion liabilities by approximately $5.4, $4.3 and $6.7, respectively, based on a change in estimate as a result of actual experience and updated information.  these adjustments are immaterial relative to the amount of trade promotion expense incurred annually by the company.
impairment of goodwill, trade names and other intangible assets carrying values of goodwill, trade names and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment.  for finite intangible assets, the company assesses business triggering events.  the company's impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to unit volume, revenue and expense growth rates, and the selection of an appropriate discount rate.  management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions.  with respect to goodwill, impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit.  for trade names and other intangible assets, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows, which represents the estimated fair value of the asset.  judgment is required in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations.  indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change, distribution losses, or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired.  the result of the company's annual goodwill impairment test determined that the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying values of all reporting units.  in addition, there were no goodwill impairment charges for each of the years in the three-year period ended december 31, 2016.

in 2014, the company recorded an impairment charge of $5.0 for an intangible asset related to the consumer domestic segment.  the impairment charge recorded in 2014 was a result of actual and projected reductions in sales and profitability as a result of increased competition.  the amount of the impairment charges was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying amount.  fair value was estimated based on a "relief from royalty" or "excess earnings" discounted cash flow method, which contains numerous variables that are subject to change as business conditions change, and therefore could impact fair values in the future.  the company determined that the fair value of all other intangible assets as of december 31, 2016 exceeded their respective carrying values based upon the forecasted cash flows and profitability.
it is possible that the company's conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets could change in future periods if, for example, (i) the businesses or brands do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in 2017 or future years vary from current assumptions (including changes in discount rates), (iii) business conditions or strategies change from current assumptions, (iv) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or (v) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda.  a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on the company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.
inventory valuation when appropriate, the company writes down the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or market (net realizable value, which reflects any costs to sell or dispose).  the company identifies any slow moving, obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether an adjustment is required to establish a new carrying value.  the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving, obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates and assumptions about the future demand for the company's products, technological changes, and new product introductions.  in addition, the company's allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the reduction of the number of stock keeping units (skus).  the company evaluates its inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and records adjustments as required.  adjustments to inventory to reflect a reduction in net realizable value were $10.5 at december 31, 2016, $12.6 at december 31, 2015, and $8.3 at december 31, 2014.
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  management provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for amounts which are not considered "more likely than not" to be realized.  the company records liabilities for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions under u.s. gaap guidelines.  the liabilities relate to tax return positions that, although supportable by the company, may be challenged by the tax authorities and do not meet the minimum recognition threshold required under applicable accounting guidance for the related tax benefit to be recognized in the income statement.  the company adjusts this liability as a result of changes in tax legislation, interpretations of laws by courts, rulings by tax authorities, changes in estimates and the expiration of the statute of limitations.  many of the judgments involved in adjusting the liability involve assumptions and estimates that are highly uncertain and subject to change.  in this regard, settlement of any issue, or an adverse determination in litigation, with a taxing authority could require the use of cash and result in an increase in the company's annual tax rate.  conversely, favorable resolution of an issue with a taxing authority would be recognized as a reduction to the company's annual tax rate.
new accounting pronouncements refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of december 31, 2016.

(1)   on january 4, 2016, the company completed the toppik acquisition, acquiring spencer forrest, inc., the maker of toppik, the leading brand of hair building fibers for people with thinning hair. net sales of this acquisition are included in the company's results since the date of acquisition.

volume growth in consumer domestic and consumer international was partially offset by lower spd volume.
the company's gross profit for 2016 was $1,590.6, a $78.8 increase compared to 2015. gross margin was 45.5% in 2016 compared to 44.5% in 2015, a 100 basis points ("bps") increase.  the increase is due to lower manufacturing costs of 70 bps (including productivity programs and the absence of start-up costs incurred in 2015 associated with the company's new vitamin manufacturing facility), lower commodity costs of 60 bps, and the impact of the higher margin acquired business of 30 bps, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates of 30 bps, a plant impairment charge of 20 bps at an international subsidiary and unfavorable price/volume mix of 10 bps.
operating costs marketing expenses for 2016 were $427.2, an increase of $9.7 compared to 2015.  marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 10 bps to 12.2% in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to 40 bps of leverage on higher net sales partially offset by 30 bps on higher expenses.
selling, general and administrative expenses ("sg&a") expenses for 2016 were $439.2, an increase of $19.1 or 4.5% compared to 2015. the increase is primarily due to costs associated with the toppik acquisition and higher compensation costs, partially offset by a pension plan charge recorded in 2015.  sg&a as a percentage of net sales increased 30 bps to 12.6% in 2016 compared to 12.3% in 2015.  the increase is due to higher costs of 60 bps, partially offset by 30 bps of leverage associated with higher sales.

other income and expenses equity in earnings of affiliates increased by $15.0 in 2016 as compared to 2015.  the increase in earnings during 2016 was due primarily to a $17.0 impairment charge in 2015 associated with the company's remaining investment in natronx.
interest expense in 2016 was $27.7, a decrease of $2.8 compared to 2015 due to a lower amount of average debt outstanding.
taxation the 2016 tax rate was 35.0% compared to 35.4% in 2015.  the 2015 tax rate was negatively impacted by a valuation allowance recorded in connection with the natronx impairment charge.

(1)   on september 19, 2014, the company acquired certain brands in the lil' drug store brands acquisition (the "lil' drug store brands acquisition") and on january 2, 2015, the company acquired certain assets of varied industries corporation (the "vi-cor acquisition"). net sales of these acquisitions are included in the company's results since the date of acquisition.

all three segments reported volume increases and favorable price/mix for the year ended december 31, 2015.
gross profit the company's gross profit for 2015 was $1,511.8, a $58.9 increase compared to 2014. gross margin was 44.5% in 2015 compared to 44.1% in 2014, a 40 basis points ("bps") increase.  the increase is due to 30 bps associated with higher volume, price and mix, favorable impact associated with the lil' drug store brands and vi-cor acquisitions of 40 bps, lower commodity costs of 70 bps, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs (net of productivity programs and including higher than anticipated start-up costs associated with the company's new vitamin manufacturing facility) of 70 bps and unfavorable foreign exchange rates of 30 bps.  the higher volume, price and mix favorability included higher trade promotion and couponing to continue to support proven consumer trial generating activities for the oxiclean megabrand.
operating costs marketing expenses for 2015 were $417.5, an increase of $0.6 compared to 2014.  the reason the increase was small was due to shifting some marketing funds to trade promotion and couponing to continue to support proven consumer trial generating activities for the oxiclean megabrand.  marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 bps to 12.3% in 2015 compared to 12.6% in 2014.  this is due to 30 bps from leverage of expenses on higher sales.
selling, general and administrative expenses ("sg&a") expenses for 2015 were $420.1, an increase of $25.3 or 6.4% compared to 2014 due primarily to both on-going and one-time costs associated with the lil' drug store brands and vi-cor acquisitions, higher compensation related costs, higher legal and research and development expenses and an $8.9 pension settlement charge in the second quarter of 2015.  the increase was partially offset by lower foreign exchange rates.  sg&a as a percentage of net sales increased 20 bps to 12.3% in 2015 compared to 12.1% in 2014.  the increase is due to higher costs of 50 bps, including 25 bps associated with the pension charge, partially offset by 30 bps of leverage associated with higher sales.

other income and expenses equity in earnings of affiliates for 2015 was a loss of $5.8 compared to earnings of $11.6 in 2014.  the decrease in earnings was primarily due to a $17.0 impairment charge associated with the company's remaining investment in natronx recorded in the second quarter of 2015.  this charge is primarily a result of lower than expected demand for the joint venture's products as a result of a shift in the electric utility industry from coal-fired to natural gas-supplied power plants, continued delays in the implementation of updated federal regulations, and indirectly, the recent u.s. supreme court ruling against the environmental protection agency ("epa") where the court stated that the epa failed to properly consider the costs to implement the regulations. we believe that the foregoing factors will likely further delay the demand for these products.
interest expense in 2015 was $30.5, an increase of $3.1 compared to 2014 due to a higher amount of average debt outstanding.
taxation the 2015 tax rate was 35.4% compared to 33.8% in 2014.  the 2015 tax rate was negatively impacted by a valuation allowance recorded in connection with the natronx impairment charge. the tax rate for 2014 was favorably impacted by discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions.
segment results for 2016, 2015 and 2014
the company operates three reportable segments: consumer domestic, consumer international and spd.  these segments are determined based on differences in the nature of products and organizational and ownership structures.    the company also has a corporate segment.

consumer domestic
2016 compared to 2015
consumer domestic net sales in 2016 were $2,677.8, an increase of $96.2 or 3.7% compared to net sales of $2,581.6 in 2015.  the components of the net sales change are the following:
net sales - consumer domestic         december 31, 2016

product volumes sold                                     3.4    %

net sales increase                                       3.7    %
(1)   includes net sales of the brands acquired in the toppik acquisition since the date of acquisition.

the increase in net sales for 2016, reflects higher sales of arm & hammer liquid and unit dose detergents, vitafusion gummy vitamins, oxiclean laundry additive arm & hammer cat litter products and batiste dry shampoo, partially offset by lower sales of xtra laundry detergent and l'il critters gummy vitamins.
there continues to be significant product and price competition in the laundry detergent category. for example, p&g markets a lower-priced line of laundry detergents, simply tide, which competes directly with the company's core value laundry detergents. p&g has significantly increased its discounting of simply tide which could have a broad negative impact on the laundry category pricing and profitability.  in addition, in 2016, henkel entered the u.s. market with persil, its leading worldwide premium laundry detergent, and on september 1, 2016 completed its acquisition of sun products, the maker of all, wisk, sun, and private label laundry detergents.  while it is too early to assess what impact this will have on the company's laundry detergent business, the introduction of persil and henkel's increased scale and market share could precipitate greater price competition in the category and distribution pressure with a potential adverse impact on the company's laundry detergent business.  moreover, the unit dose laundry detergent segment is the fastest growing segment in the laundry detergent category, having grown to approximately 16% of the category since the introduction of this form in 2012, and the company faces pressure to achieve its proportionate share of the segment with a potential adverse impact on its share of the laundry detergent category.  the company continues to evaluate and vigorously combat these pressures through, among other things, new product introductions and increased marketing and trade spending.  additionally, while the category grew 3.3% for the 52 weeks ended december 17, 2016 and 1.6% for the 52 weeks ended december 19, 2015, after experiencing declines in 2013 and 2014, there is no assurance the category will not decline in the future and that the company will be able to offset any such decline.
consumer domestic income before income taxes for 2016 was $590.6, a $61.2 increase as compared to 2015.  the increase is due primarily to the impact of higher sales volumes of $70.1, favorable commodity and manufacturing costs of $40.3, partially offset by higher sg&a costs of $24.7, unfavorable price/mix of $17.2, and higher marketing expenses of $8.7.

(1)   on september 19, 2014, the company acquired certain feminine care brands from lil' drug store products inc. net sales of the brands acquired in the lil' drug store brands acquisition are included in the company's results since the date of acquisition.

the increase in net sales in 2015 includes sales from the lil' drug store brands acquisition, higher sales from the new product launches of arm & hammer clump & seal cat litter product lines including the new lightweight variant launched in december 2014, arm & hammer liquid laundry detergent, and batiste dry shampoo and were offset by lower sales of spinbrush toothbrushes, trojan condoms and xtra laundry detergent.
since the introduction in the u.s. of unit dose laundry detergent by various manufacturers, including the company, there has been significant product and price competition in the laundry detergent category.  for example p&g markets a lower-priced line of laundry detergents that competes directly with the company's core value laundry detergents and henkel has entered the u.s. market with persil, its leading worldwide premium laundry detergent.  while it is too early to assess what impact this will have on the premium laundry category or the company's laundry detergent business, the introduction of persil could precipitate greater price competition in the category and distribution pressure with a potential adverse impact on oxiclean laundry detergent.  the company continues to evaluate and vigorously combat the pressures in the laundry detergent category through, among other things, new product introductions and increased marketing spending.  while the category grew 1.6% in 2015 after experiencing declines in 2013 and 2014, there is no assurance the category will not decline in the future and that the company will be able to offset any such decline.
delays in the company's second quarter start-up of the new vitamin manufacturing facility resulted in the need to place certain retailers on allocation, which contributed to increased retailer frustration. by the end of the year, these issues were mainly resolved.  if the company were to lose a significant customer or if any sales of its products were to materially decrease due to customer service levels or real or perceived product quality or appearance issues, it could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition and results of operations.
consumer domestic income before income taxes for 2015 was $529.4, a $26.6 increase compared to 2014.  the increase is due primarily to the impact of higher sales volumes of $61.1 partially offset by higher sg&a costs of $24.1 and higher marketing expenses of $3.3.  higher manufacturing costs of $6.0 include vitamin manufacturing start-up costs, which were partially offset by productivity programs and lower commodity costs.
consumer international
2016 compared to 2015
consumer international net sales in 2016 were $525.2, an increase of $24.2 or 4.8% as compared to 2015.  the components of the net sales change are the following:

excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates, higher sales for the year occurred in exports, canada, mexico, and europe.  the batiste, arm & hammer, oxiclean, femfresh, sterimar, and trojan brands had strong sales growth.
consumer international income before income taxes was $66.3 in 2016, an increase of $11.8 compared to 2015 due primarily to higher volumes of $23.4, favorable price/mix of $7.5 and lower sg&a of $1.4, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates of $12.2, higher marketing costs of $6.2, and higher manufacturing costs of $2.3.  last year's results included an $8.9 pension settlement charge.
2015 compared to 2014
consumer international net sales in 2015 were $501.0, a decrease of $34.2 or 6.4% as compared to 2014.  the components of the net sales change are the following:
net sales - consumer international        december 31, 2015

(1)   on september 19, 2014, the company acquired certain feminine care brands from lil' drug store products inc. ("lil' drug store brands acquisition"). net sales of the brands acquired in the lil' drug store brands acquisition are included in the company's results since the date of acquisition.

the decrease in consumer international net sales in 2015 was primarily due to the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in 2015 compared to 2014, which offset higher sales in europe, australia and mexico.
consumer international income before income taxes was $54.5 in 2015, a decrease of $10.2 compared to 2014 due primarily to unfavorable foreign exchange rates of $20.8, an $8.9 pension settlement charge, and higher marketing costs of $7.3, as well as, higher trade promotion, commodity and marketing costs, partially offset by higher volumes of $19.7 and favorable price/mix of $6.1.

2016 compared to 2015

net sales increase                                  (7.1   %)
the net sales decrease in 2016 reflects lower sales in the animal productivity business driven primarily by continued low milk prices and a strong year ago results comparison.  the low milk prices are principally due to an excess global supply of milk and weak exports due to a strong u.s. dollar.
spd income before income taxes was $39.8 in 2016, a decrease of $17.5 compared to 2015.  the decrease in income before income taxes for 2016 is due primarily to lower sales volume of $8.7, a plant impairment charge of $4.9, higher manufacturing costs of $4.1, and higher sg&a of $2.8 partially offset by lower other expense of $2.3 mainly as a result of foreign exchange rate changes.

(1)   on january 2, 2015, the company acquired certain assets of varied industries corporation. net sales are included in the company's results since the date of the vi-cor acquisition.

the sales increase in 2015 reflects the impact of the vi-cor acquisition, as well as, higher sales volume of performance products partially offset by lower animal nutrition products and foreign exchange fluctuations.
spd income before income taxes was $57.3 in 2015, an increase of $11.5 compared to 2014.  the increase in income before income taxes for 2015 is due primarily to higher sales volume of $18.8 and lower manufacturing costs of $10.1, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates of $6.8, sg&a of $9.1 and higher marketing expenses of $1.3.
corporate the corporate segment reflects the administrative costs of the production, planning and logistics functions which are included in sg&a expenses in the operating segments but are elements of cost of sales in the company's consolidated statements of income.  such amounts were $36.6, $32.6 and $26.7 for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
also included in corporate segment are the equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates from armand and armakleen in 2016 and armand, armakleen and natronx in 2015 and 2014.  the increase in equity in earnings of affiliates in 2016 is primarily due to the $17.0 natronx impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of 2015.
liquidity and capital resources on december 4, 2015, the company replaced its former $600.0 unsecured revolving credit facility with a $1,000.0 unsecured revolving credit facility (as amended from time to time, the "credit agreement").  under the credit agreement, the company has the ability to increase its borrowing up to an additional $600.0, subject to lender commitments and certain conditions as described in the credit agreement.  borrowings under the credit agreement are available for general corporate purposes and are used to support the company's $1,000.0 commercial paper program (the "program").  unless extended, the credit agreement will terminate and all amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable on december 4, 2020.
as of december 31, 2016, the company had $187.8 in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $576.0 available through the revolving facility under its credit agreement and its commercial paper program, and a commitment increase feature under the credit agreement that enables the company to borrow up to an additional $600.0, subject to lending commitments of the participating lenders and certain conditions as described in the credit agreement.  to preserve its liquidity, the company invests its cash primarily in government money market funds and short term bank deposits.
during 2015, the company liquidated its subsidiary in the netherlands and decided that the earnings of its subsidiary in france would no longer be permanently reinvested outside of the u.s.  as a result, the company repatriated cash of $93.0.  the funds repatriated were used to reduce outstanding commercial paper.  as a result of liquidating its subsidiary in the netherlands, the company recorded a tax benefit of $2.7 in the consolidated statement of income and a deferred tax benefit of $11.6 through accumulated other comprehensive income in the second quarter of 2015.  as of december 31, 2016, there remains $150.1 of cash and cash equivalents held by the foreign subsidiaries that is considered to be permanently reinvested outside of the u.s.  these funds are not needed for operations in the u.s.  if they were, the company would be required to accrue and pay taxes in the u.s. to repatriate these funds.  the company's intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside the u.s., and the company does not currently expect to repatriate them to fund u.s. operations.

on december 9, 2014, the company issued $300.0 aggregate principal amount of 2.45% senior notes due december 15, 2019 (the "2019 notes").  the 2019 notes were issued under the first supplemental indenture (the "first supplemental indenture"), dated december 9, 2014, to the indenture dated december 9, 2014 (the "base indenture"), between the company and wells fargo bank, n.a., as trustee.  interest on the 2019 notes is payable semi-annually, beginning june 15, 2015.  the 2019 notes will mature on december 15, 2019, unless earlier retired or redeemed pursuant to the terms of the first supplemental indenture.
on september 26, 2012, the company issued $400.0 aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior notes due 2022 (the "2022 notes").  the 2022 notes were issued under the second supplemental indenture, dated september 26, 2012 (the "bny mellon second supplemental indenture") to the indenture dated december 15, 2010 (the "bny mellon base indenture") between the company and the bank of new york mellon trust company, n.a., as trustee.  interest on the 2022 notes is payable semi-annually, beginning april 1, 2013.  the 2022 notes will mature on october 1, 2022, unless earlier retired or redeemed pursuant to the terms of the bny mellon second supplemental indenture.
the current economic environment presents risks that could have adverse consequences for the company's liquidity.  (see "unfavorable economic conditions could adversely affect demand for the company's products" under "risk factors" in item 1a of this annual report.)  the company does not anticipate that current economic conditions will adversely affect its ability to comply with the financial covenant in the credit agreement because the company currently is, and anticipates that it will continue to be, in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio requirement under the credit agreement.
on february 7, 2017, the board declared a 7% increase in the regular quarterly dividend from $0.1775 to $0.19 per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $0.76 per share payable to stockholders of record as of february 21, 2017.  the increase raises the annual dividend payout from $183 to approximately $195, and maintains the company's payout of dividends relative to net income at approximately 40%.
on november 2, 2016, the board authorized a new share repurchase program, under which the company may repurchase up to $500.0 in shares of common stock (the "2016 share repurchase program").  the 2016 share repurchase program does not have an expiration and replaced the 2015 share repurchase program.  the company also continued its evergreen share repurchase program, authorized by the board on january 29, 2014, under which the company may repurchase, from time to time, common stock to reduce or eliminate dilution associated with issuances of common stock under the company's incentive plans.
in 2016, the company purchased approximately 9.0 million shares of common stock for $400.0, of which $103.0 was purchased under the evergreen share repurchase program, $200.0 was purchased under the 2016 share repurchase program, and $97.0 was purchased under the 2015 share repurchase program.  as a result of the company's purchases, there remained $300.0 under the 2016 share repurchase program as of december 31, 2016.
the company anticipates that its cash from operations, together with its current borrowing capacity, will be sufficient to meet its capital expenditure program costs, which are expected to be approximately $55.0 in 2017, fund its share repurchase programs to the extent implemented by management and pay dividends at the latest approved rate.  cash, together with the company's current borrowing capacity, may be used for acquisitions that would complement the company's existing product lines or geographic markets.  the company does not have any mandatory fixed rate debt principal payments in 2017.

2016 compared to 2015
net cash provided by operating activities - the company's primary source of liquidity is its cash flow provided by operating activities, which is dependent on the level of net income and changes in working capital.  the company's net cash provided by operating activities in 2016 increased by $49.2 to $655.3 as compared to $606.1 in 2015 due to a reduction in working capital and higher cash earnings (net income plus non-cash expenses such as depreciation, amortization, non-cash compensation and asset impairment charges).  the change in working capital is primarily due to higher accounts receivable, including the impact of factoring

an additional $22.3 to a bank, a decrease in inventories and higher accounts payable and accrued expenses.  the company measures working capital effectiveness based on its cash conversion cycle.  the following table presents the company's cash conversion cycle information for the quarters ended december 31, 2016 and 2015:
as of

december 31, 2016           december 31, 2015   change days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable ("dso")                    30                          33          (3   )
days of inventory outstanding ("dio")                                       51                          50   1
days of accounts payable outstanding ("dpo")                                60                          56          (4   )
cash conversion cycle                                                       21                          27          (6   )
the company's cash conversion cycle (defined as the sum of dso and dio less dpo) which is calculated using a 2 period average method, improved 6 days from the prior year amount of 27 days to 21 days at december 31, 2016 due primarily to improved dso of 3 days from 33 to 30 days due to factoring. dio increased 1 day from 50 to 51 days.  dpo improved by 4 days as the company continues to extend payment terms with its suppliers.  the improvement in the company's cash conversion cycle reflects the company's continued focus on reducing its average working capital requirements.
net cash used in investing activities - net cash used in investing activities during 2016 was $354.6, principally reflecting $305.3 for acquisitions and $49.8 for property, plant and equipment expenditures.
net cash used in financing activities - net cash used in financing activities during 2016 was $439.6, primarily reflecting $400.0 of repurchases of the company's common stock and $183.0 of cash dividend payments, partially offset by $80.5 of proceeds and tax benefits from stock option exercises, and $65.5 of additional commercial paper borrowings, and an additional $3.4 of short term borrowings at an international subsidiary.
2015 compared to 2014
net cash provided by operating activities - the company's primary source of liquidity is the strong cash flow provided by operating activities, which is dependent on the level of net income and changes in working capital.  the company's net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 increased by $65.8 to $606.1 compared to 2014 due to higher cash earnings (net income plus non-cash expenses such as depreciation, amortization, non-cash compensation and asset impairment charges) and lower working capital.  the decrease in working capital is primarily due to lower accounts receivable as a result of factoring $37.8 to a bank and higher accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of invoice payments.  this was partially offset by higher inventory in support of higher sales.  the company measures working capital effectiveness based on its cash conversion cycle.  the company's cash conversion cycle (defined as days in accounts receivable plus days in inventory less days in accounts payable) which is calculated using a 2 period average method, improved 5 days from the prior year amount of 32 days to 27 days at december 31, 2015 due primarily to improved accounts receivable of 4 days and accounts payable of 2 days.  inventory increased 1 day from 49 to 50 days.  the improvement in the company's cash conversion cycle reflects the company's continued focus on reducing its average working capital requirements.
net cash used in investing activities - net cash used in investing activities during 2015 was $141.2, principally reflecting $74.9 for the vi-cor acquisition and $61.8 for property, plant and equipment expenditures, in part due to the company's new gummy dietary supplement manufacturing facility in york, pennsylvania.
net cash used in financing activities - net cash used in financing activities 2015 was $535.0, primarily reflecting $363.1 of repurchases of common stock, $175.3 of cash dividend payments and repayment of a $250.0 bond that matured in 2015, partially offset by higher commercial paper and short term borrowings of $211.7 and $44.3 of proceeds and tax benefits from stock option exercises.

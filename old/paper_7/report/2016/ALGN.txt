item 7.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with "selected consolidated financial data" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
overview our goal is to establish invisalign clear aligners as the standard method for treating malocclusion and to establish the itero intraoral scanner as the preferred scanning device for 3d digital scans, ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals. we intend to achieve this by continued focus and execution of our strategic growth drivers set forth in the business strategy section in our annual report on form 10-k.
the successful execution of our business strategy in 2017 and beyond may be affected by a number of other factors including:
•   new products, feature enhancements and technology innovation. product innovation drives greater treatment predictability and clinical applicability and ease of use for our customers which supports adoption of invisalign in their practices. increasing applicability and treating more complex cases requires that we move away from individual features to more comprehensive solutions so that invisalign providers can more predictably treat the whole case, such as with our invisalign "g-series" of product innovations, including our most recent october 2016 release of invisalign g7. invisalign g7 delivers better upper lateral control, improved root control and features to address prevention of posterior open bites. concurrently, we also announced clincheck pro 5.0, which has new features designed to deliver an improved and user friendly experience and increased control to invisalign providers. since the itero element began shipping in september 2015, the use of itero scanners for invisalign case submissions in place of polyvinyl-siloxane ("pvs") impressions has gradually increased to a record 51.3% of cases from north america and 24.9% of cases from international doctors as of the fourth quarter of 2016. we believe that over the long-term, clinical solutions and treatment tools will increase adoption of invisalign and increase sales of our intraoral scanners; however, it is difficult to predict the rate of adoption which may vary by region and channel.
•   invisalign adoption. our goal is to establish invisalign as the treatment of choice for treating malocclusion ultimately driving increased product adoption and frequency of use by dental professionals, also known as "utilization rates." our quarterly utilization rates for the last 9 quarters are as follows:
*    invisalign utilization rates = # of cases shipped divided by # of doctors cases were shipped to
35
◦   total utilization in the fourth quarter of 2016 increased to 5.2 cases per doctor compared to 4.9 in the fourth quarter of 2015.
▪   north america: utilization among our north american orthodontist customers reached an all time high of 11.3 cases per doctor in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 9.9 in the fourth quarter of 2015. the increase in north america orthodontist utilization reflects improvements in product and technology which continues to strengthen our doctors' clinical confidence in the use of invisalign such that they now utilize invisalign more often and on more complex cases, including their teenage patients.
▪   international: international doctor utilization of 5.0 cases per doctor in the fourth quarter of 2016 was flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. the international utilization reflects growth in both the europe, middle east and africa ("emea") and asia pacific ("apac") regions due to increasing adoption of the product and its ability to treat more complex cases; however, utilization remained flat primarily due to the expansion of our customer base, particularly in apac.
we expect that over the long-term our utilization rates will gradually improve as a result of advancements in product and technology, which continue to strengthen our doctors' clinical confidence in the use of invisalign; however, we expect that our utilization rates may fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors, including seasonal trends in our business along with adoption rates of new products and features.
•   number of new invisalign doctors trained. we continue to expand our invisalign customer base through the training of new doctors. in 2016, invisalign growth was driven primarily by increased utilization across all regions as well as by the continued expansion of our customer base as we trained a total of 11,680 new invisalign doctors, of which 60% were trained internationally.
•   international invisalign growth. we will continue to focus our efforts towards increasing invisalign adoption by dental professionals in our direct international markets. on a year over year basis, international invisalign volume increased 32.4% driven primarily by strong performance in our apac and in europe regions. in 2017, we are continuing to expand in our existing markets through targeted investments in sales coverage and professional marketing and education programs, along with consumer marketing in selected country markets. we expect international invisalign revenues to continue to grow at a faster rate than north america for the foreseeable future due to our continued investment in international market expansion, the size of the market opportunity, and our relatively low market penetration in this region (refer to item 1a risk factors - "we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations." for information on related risk factors).
•   establish regional order acquisition and treatment planning facilities: we intend to establish additional order acquisition and treatment planning facilities closer to our international customers in order to improve our operational efficiency and provide doctors with a great experience to further improve their confidence in using invisalign to treat more patients and more often (refer to item 1a risk factors - "as we continue to grow, we are subject to growth related risks, including risks related to excess or constrained capacity at our existing facilities." for information on related risk factors).
•   operating expenses. we expect operating expenses to increase in 2017 due in part to:
◦   investments in international expansion in new country markets particularly in the apac region;
◦   investments in manufacturing to enhance our regional capabilities;
◦   increases in legal expenses primarily related to the continued protection of our intellectual property rights, including our patents;
◦   increases in sales and customer support resources;
◦   increases in expenses related to the purchase of our new corporate headquarters in san jose, california; and
◦   product and technology innovation to address such things as treatment times, indications unique to teens and predictability.
we believe that these investments will position us to increase our revenue and continue to grow our market share.
36
•   stock repurchases:
◦   april 2014 repurchase program. in 2016, we repurchased $50.0 million of our common stock through an accelerated stock repurchase agreement and $46.2 million of stock repurchase in the open market.
◦   april 2016 repurchase program. on april 28, 2016, we announced that our board of directors had authorized a plan to repurchase up to $300.0 million of our stock.
◦   remaining available repurchases. as of december 31, 2016, we have $3.8 million remaining under the april 2014 repurchase program and $300.0 million under the april 2016 repurchase plan (refer to note 10 "common stock repurchase program" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details on stock repurchase program).
•   smiledirectclub. on july 25, 2016, we entered into a supply agreement with smiledirectclub, llc ("sdc") to manufacture clear aligners for sdc's doctor-led, at-home program for simple teeth straightening. in october 2016, we became sdc's exclusive third-party supplier and commercial supplying aligners for its minor tooth movement aligner program. as part of the transaction, we acquired a 17% equity interest in sdc for $46.7 million. we also provided a revolving line of credit to sdc of up to $15.0 million to fund their working capital and general corporate needs (refer to note 4 "equity method investments" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details on accounting treatment).
we expect the supply agreement to be incremental to revenue growth in 2017.
•   new corporate headquarters office purchase agreement. on december 19, 2016, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement (the "purchase agreement") with lba riv-company xxx, llc ("seller") to purchase the real property located in san jose, california (the "property") for the purchase price of $44.1 million. we closed the purchase agreement on january 26, 2017 (refer to note 8 "commitments and contingencies" of the notes of consolidated financial statements for more information on the purchase agreement).
results of operations net revenues by reportable segment comparison for year ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:
we group our operations into two reportable segments: clear aligner segment and scanner segment
•   our clear aligner segment consists of our invisalign system which includes invisalign full, teen and assist ("comprehensive products"), express/lite ("non-comprehensive products"), vivera retainers, along with our training and ancillary products for treating malocclusion ("non-case"). clear aligner segment also include the sale of aligners to sdc under our supply agreement which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2016. sdc revenue is recorded after eliminating outstanding intercompany transactions.
•   our scanner segment consists of intraoral scanning systems and additional services available with the intraoral scanners that provide digital alternatives to the traditional cast models. this segment includes our itero scanner and orthocad services.
net revenues for our clear aligner segment and scanner segment by region for the year ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows (in millions):

fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015
total net revenues increased by $234.3 million in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily as a result of case volume growth across all regions and products as well as increased non-case revenue.
clear aligner - north america north america net revenues increased by $70.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to case volume growth across all channels and products which increased net revenues by $82.7 million. this increase was offset in part by lower average selling price ("asp") which decreased net revenues by $12.7 million. asp declined in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of higher promotional discounts of $21.9 million as well as an increase in net deferrals of $7.7 million primarily related to the full year effect of our new additional aligners product policy launched in july 2015. these declines were partially offset by price increases on our comprehensive products effective april 1, 2016 which contributed $17.7 million to net revenues.
clear aligner - international international net revenues increased by $76.5 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily driven by case volume growth across all channels and products which increased net revenues by $80.9 million. this increase was offset in part by lower asp which decreased net revenues by $4.4 million. asp declined in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of higher promotional discounts of $6.9 million as well as the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates of $6.8 million. these declines were partially offset by the price increases on our comprehensive products effective april 1, 2016 which contributed $5.7 million to net revenues, as well as an increase in additional aligner revenue of $3.5 million.
clear aligner - non-case non-case net revenues, consisting of training fees and ancillary product revenues, increased by $11.6 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to increased vivera volume both in north america and international.
38
scanner scanner net revenues increased by $76.2 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in the number of scanners recognized as we began shipping our next generation itero element scanner in september 2015, and, to a lesser extent, an increase in asp.
fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014
total net revenues increased by $83.9 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of case volume growth across all regions and products as well as increased non-case revenue.
clear aligner - north america north america net revenues increased by $52.1 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to case volume growth across all channels and products which increased net revenues by approximately $79.0 million. these increases were offset in part by lower asp, which decreased net revenues by $26.9 million. the decrease in asp was primarily as a result of higher net revenue deferrals of $16.0 million, which includes the impact of our new additional aligner product policy launched in july 2015 of $8.9 million and the impact of higher promotional discounts in 2015 as compared to 2014 of $11.7 million. these decreases in asp were offset in part by the price increase, effective april 1, 2015 on our comprehensive products.
clear aligner - international international net revenues increased by $30.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily driven by case volume growth across all products of $71.5 million. this was partially offset by lower asp which decreased net revenues by approximately $41.1 million. the decrease in asp was primarily as a result of the unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates primarily due to the weakening of the euro compared to the u.s. dollar in 2015 compared to 2014 of $34.5 million, and, to a lesser extent, higher net revenue deferrals of $7.8 million which includes the impact of our new additional aligner product policy launched in july 2015 of $4.7 million, as well as higher promotional discounts of $6.3 million in 2015 compared to 2014. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in asp as we transitioned to direct sales in certain apac countries and emea regions, as well as the price increase on our comprehensive products effective july 1, 2015.
clear aligner - non-case non-case net revenues, consisting of training fees and ancillary product revenues, increased by $5.2 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to increased vivera volume both in north america and international.
scanner scanner net revenues decreased by $3.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a decrease in scanner revenue, offset in part by a slight increase in services revenue. in march 2015, we announced our next generation scanner and began shipping the itero element scanner in september 2015. scanner revenues declined in 2015 primarily due to fewer scanners recognized and permanent price reductions on our previous generation scanner. the increase in services revenue was primarily due to an increase in the volume of cad/cam services resulting from a larger installed base of scanners.

cost of net revenues for our clear aligner and scanner segments includes salaries for staff involved in the production process, the cost of materials, packaging, shipping costs, depreciation on capital equipment and facilities used in the production process, amortization of acquired intangible assets from training costs and stock-based compensation.
fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015
clear aligner the gross margin percentage declined in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily driven by a higher number of aligners per case and lower asp which was partially offset by higher absorption as a result of increased production volumes.
scanner the gross margin percentage increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to a product mix shift to our itero element scanner which has a higher asp along with lower costs per unit.
fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014
clear aligner the gross margin percentage declined in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower asp which was partially offset by higher absorption as a result of increased production volumes.
scanner the gross margin percentage decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower asp from permanent price reductions on our previous generation scanner, higher manufacturing costs from lower production volumes and higher inventory reserves. this was partially offset by a product mix shift to the lower cost element scanner which commenced shipping in september 2015.

selling, general and administrative expense includes personnel-related costs including payroll, commissions and stock-based compensation for our sales force, marketing and administration in addition to media and advertising expenses, clinical education, trade shows and industry events, product marketing, outside consulting services, legal expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, the medical device excise tax ("mdet") and allocations of corporate overhead expenses including facilities and it.
selling, general and administrative expense increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to higher compensation related costs of $47.1 million as a result of increased headcount, resulting in higher salaries expense, incentive bonuses and fringe benefits. we also incurred higher expenses from advertising and marketing of $16.5 million, outside services costs of $12.2 million, equipment and material costs of $6.8 million, travel and related costs of $6.0 million and credit card processing fees of $4.2 million. in addition, during the first quarter of 2015, there was a refund of mdet taxes paid in 2014 of $6.8 million as our aligners are no longer subject to the excise tax.
selling, general and administrative expense increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher compensation related costs of $50.1 million as a result of increased headcount, which led to higher salaries, stock based compensation and commissions. in addition, consulting costs increased by $9.7 million primarily due to our enterprise resource planning ("erp") project. partially offsetting these increases was the mdet refund of $6.8 million received in the first quarter of 2015.

fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015
clear aligner operating margin percentage declined in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to higher compensation costs as a result of increased headcount, higher number of aligners manufactured per case and lower asp.
scanner operating margin percentage increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to a product mix shift to our itero element scanner resulting in a higher asp and lower costs per unit. we also incurred lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues as we leveraged our operating expenses on higher revenues.
fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014
clear aligner operating margin percentage declined in 2015 compared to 2014 due to higher compensation costs as a result of increased headcount, higher research and development expenses due to our investment in obstructive sleep apnea and lower asp.
scanner operating margin percentage decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower asp, higher manufacturing costs, higher inventory reserves and increased compensation related costs.

our provision for income taxes was $51.2 million, $42.1 million and $44.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 21.1%, 22.6% and 23.4%, respectively. our effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due to certain foreign earnings, primarily in costa rica and the netherlands, which are subject to lower tax rates and the impacts from our new international corporate structure in 2016, partially offset by the tax impact of certain stock-based compensation charges and unrecognized tax benefits. the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily related to our international corporate restructuring as explained below. the decrease in the effective rate for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 2014 is mainly due to a $1.8 million tax adjustment recorded in 2014 which related to prior periods.
our total gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, was $46.4 million and $39.4 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, all of which would impact our effective tax rate if recognized. we have elected to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income taxes. for the year ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, interest and penalties included in tax expense was $1.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively. our total interest and penalties accrued as of december 31, 2016 was $2.1 million. we do not expect any significant changes to the amount of unrecognized tax benefit within the next twelve months.
we file u.s. federal, u.s. state, and non-u.s. income tax returns. our major tax jurisdictions are u.s. federal and the state of california. for u.s. federal and state tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examinations for years before 2000. with few exceptions, we are no longer subject to examination by foreign tax authorities for years before 2007. our subsidiary in israel is under audit by the local tax authorities for calendar years 2006 through 2013.
on july 1, 2016, we implemented a new international corporate structure. this changes the structure of our international procurement and sales operations, as well as realigns the ownership and use of intellectual property among our wholly-owned subsidiaries. we continue to anticipate that an increasing percentage of our consolidated pre-tax income will be derived from, and reinvested in our foreign operations. we believe that income taxed in certain foreign jurisdictions at a lower rate relative to the u.s. federal statutory rate will have a beneficial impact on our worldwide effective tax rate over time. although the license of intellectual property rights between consolidated entities did not result in any gain in the consolidated financial statements, the company generated taxable income in certain jurisdictions in 2016 resulting in a tax expense of $34.3 million. additionally, as a result of the restructuring, we reassessed the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets considering all available evidence. given the current earnings and anticipated future earnings of our subsidiary in israel, we concluded that we have sufficient
43
positive evidence to release the valuation allowance against our israel operating loss carryforwards of $31.4 million, which resulted in an income tax benefit in this period of the same amount.
as of december 31, 2016, our remaining valuation allowance was not material.
in june 2009, the costa rica ministry of foreign trade, an agency of the government of costa rica, granted a twelve year extension of certain income tax incentives, which were previously granted in 2002. the incentive tax rates will expire in various years beginning in 2017. we intend to seek a renewal of these income tax incentives before they expire. under these incentives, all of the income in costa rica during these twelve year incentive periods is subject to a reduced tax rate. in order to receive the benefit of these incentives, we must hire specified numbers of employees and maintain certain minimum levels of fixed asset investment in costa rica. if we do not fulfill these conditions for any reason, our incentive could lapse, and our income in costa rica would be subject to taxation at higher rates, which could have a negative impact on our operating results. the costa rica corporate income tax rate that would apply, absent the incentives, is 30% for 2016, 2015 and 2014. as a result of these incentives, our income taxes were reduced by $19.1 million, $32.7 million and $32.5 million in the year ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, representing a benefit to diluted net income per share of $0.23 in the year ended december 31, 2016 and $0.40 for both the year ended december 31, 2015 and 2014.
as of december 31, 2016, approximately $438.0 million of undistributed earnings from non-u.s. operations held by our foreign subsidiaries are designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. we maintain sufficient cash reserves in the u.s. and do not intend to repatriate our foreign earnings. as a result, u.s. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on these foreign earnings. if these earnings were distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, we would be subject to additional u.s. income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes. we intend to use the undistributed earnings for local operating expansions and to meet local operating working capital needs. in addition, a significant amount of the cash earned by foreign subsidiaries has been and will continue to be utilized to affect the new international corporate structure described above.

as of december 31, 2016, we had $700.0 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term marketable securities.  cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of money market funds and highly liquid debt instruments which primarily include commercial paper, corporate bonds, u.s. dollar denominated foreign corporate bonds, u.s. government agency bonds, u.s. government treasury bonds, municipal securities, asset-backed securities and certificates of deposit.
as of december 31, 2016, approximately $459.0 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to u.s. income taxation on repatriation to the u.s. the costs to repatriate our foreign earnings to the u.s. would likely be material; however, our intent is
44
to permanently reinvest our earnings from foreign operations, and our current plans do not require us to repatriate them to fund our u.s. operations as we generate sufficient domestic operating cash flow and have access to external funding under our current revolving line of credit.

investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was $72.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, which primarily consisted of maturities and sales of our marketable securities of $604.0 million. these inflows were partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $405.6 million, property, plant and equipment purchases of $70.6 million including the implementation of our new erp system and $46.7 million related to our equity interest investment in smiledirectclub, llc ("sdc").
for 2017, we expect to invest $220.0 million to $250.0 million on capital expenditures primarily for our purchase of a new corporate headquarters office, new order acquisition facility in singapore and other additional manufacturing and capacity to support our international expansion. although we believe our current investment portfolio has little risk of impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain unimpaired.
net cash used in investing activities was $166.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, which primarily consisted of purchases of marketable securities of $447.1 million and property, plant and equipment purchases of $53.5 million for additional manufacturing capacity and infrastructure including the project to implement a new erp system which we started in late 2014. these uses were partially offset by $334.1 million of maturities and sales of our marketable securities.
net cash used in investing activities was $201.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, which primarily consisted of purchases of marketable securities of $437.2 million and property, plant and equipment purchases of $24.1 million. these uses were partially offset by $259.8 million of maturities and sales of our marketable securities.
financing activities net cash used by financing activities was $95.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily resulting from a common stock repurchase of $96.2 million (refer to note 10 "common stock repurchase program" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details on the stock repurchase program) and $29.9 million of payroll taxes paid for vesting of restricted stock units ("rsus") through share withholdings, partially offset by excess tax benefit from our share-based compensation arrangements of $16.8 million and proceeds from issuance of common stock of $13.8 million.
net cash used by financing activities was $100.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 resulting from repurchases of our common stock of $101.8 million and $20.7 million of payroll taxes paid for our employees' vesting of rsus through share withholdings, partially off-set by proceeds from issuance of common stock of $11.3 million and $10.4 million from excess tax benefit from our share-based compensation arrangements.
net cash used by financing activities was $66.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 resulting from repurchases of our common stock of $98.2 million and $7.6 million of payroll taxes paid for our employees' vesting of rsus through share withholdings, partially off-set by proceeds from issuance of common stock of $18.0 million and $21.4 million from excess tax benefit from our share-based compensation arrangements.
as restricted stock units are taxable to the individuals when they vest, the number of shares we issue to each of our employees will be net of applicable withholding taxes which will be paid by us on their behalf.  during 2016, 2015 and 2014, we paid $29.9 million, $20.7 million and $7.6 million, respectively, for taxes related to rsus that vested during the periods. the cash paid for

taxes related to rsus in 2016 and 2015 increased in comparison to 2014 due to the company changing its policy in mid 2014 to pay for employees' payroll taxes related to their vesting rsus instead of requiring employees to sell to cover for their payroll taxes.
stock repurchases refer to note 10 "common stock repurchase program" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details on stock repurchase program.
◦   april 2014 repurchase program. in 2016, we repurchased $50.0 million of our common stock through an accelerated stock repurchase agreement and $46.2 million of stock repurchase in the open market.
◦   april 2016 repurchase program. on april 28, 2016, we announced that our board of directors had authorized a plan to repurchase up to $300.0 million of our stock.
◦   remaining available repurchases. as of december 31, 2016, we have $3.8 million remaining under the april 2014 repurchase program and $300.0 million under the april 2016 repurchase plan.
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities combined with our positive cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and stock repurchases for at least the next 12 months. if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows, we may need to suspend our stock repurchase program or seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing, collaborative or other arrangements with other companies, bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations. there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all. if adequate funds are not available, we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy, business structure or operations.  accordingly, the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
credit facility on march 22, 2013, we entered into a credit facility for a $50.0 million revolving line of credit, with a $10.0 million letter of credit sublimit, and has a maturity date on march 22, 2018 (refer to note 7 "credit facility" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the credit facility).
contractual obligations/off balance sheet arrangements the impact that our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2016 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods is as follows (in thousands):
payments due by period total   less than1 year                   1-3years             3-5years       more than5 years operating lease obligations              $53,921       $12,880                       $18,804              $13,096            $9,141
unconditional purchase obligations       163,688       -                                   -                    -            -
total contractual cash obligations      $217,609       $12,880                       $18,804              $13,096            $9,141
our contractual obligations table above excludes approximately $45.1 million of non-current uncertain tax benefits which are included in other long-term obligations and deferred tax assets on our balance sheet as of december 31, 2016.  we have not included this amount because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities, if any.
we had no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s-k item 303(a) (4) as of december 31, 2016.
47
indemnification provisions in the normal course of business to facilitate transactions in our services and products, we indemnify customers, vendors, lessors, and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, services to be provided by us and intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. in addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim.
it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. additionally, we have a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. however, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. as of december 31, 2016, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements.  we evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, goodwill and finite-lived assets and related impairment, and income taxes.  we use authoritative pronouncements, historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates.  actual results could differ from those estimates.
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. for further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see note 1 "summary of significant accounting policies" of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item 8.
revenue recognition we enter into sales arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services where certain elements of the sales arrangement are not delivered in one reporting period. we measure and allocate revenue according to the accounting guidance for multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements in accounting standards update ("asu") 2009-13, multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements-a consensus of the financial accounting standard board ("fasb") emerging issues task force.
each element within a multiple-element arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met: the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis; and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services, delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us. we consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer. further, our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products. the arrangement consideration is allocated to each element, delivered or undelivered, based on the relative selling price of each unit of accounting based first on vendor-specific objective evidence ("vsoe") if it exists, second on third-party evidence ("tpe") if it exists, or on best estimated selling price ("besp") if neither vsoe nor tpe exist (a description as to how we determine vsoe, tpe and besp is provided below).
•   vsoe - in most instances, this applies to products and services that are sold separately in stand-alone arrangements. we determine vsoe based on pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately, considering geographical, customer, and other economic or marketing variables, as well as renewal rates or stand-alone prices for the service element(s).
•   tpe - if we cannot establish vsoe of selling price for a specific product or service included in a multiple-element arrangement, we use third-party evidence of selling price. we determine tpe based on sales of comparable amount of similar products or service offered by multiple third parties considering the degree of customization and similarity of product or service sold.
•   besp - the best estimated selling price represents the price at which we would sell a product or service if it were sold on a stand-alone basis. when vsoe or tpe does not exist for all elements, we determine besp for the arrangement element based on sales, cost and margin analysis, as well as other inputs based on our pricing practices. adjustments for
48
other market and company specific factors are made as deemed necessary in determining besp. we regularly review our estimates of selling price and maintain internal controls over the establishment and update of these estimates.
judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions, to determine the best estimated selling price for each accounting unit, and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. further, while changes in the allocation of the best estimated selling price between the accounting units will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.
clear aligner we enter into arrangements ("treatment plans") that involve multiple future product deliverables. invisalign full, invisalign teen, and invisalign assist products ("comprehensive products") include optional additional aligners at no charge for a period of up to five years after initial shipment. invisalign teen also includes up to six optional replacement aligners in the price of the product and may be ordered by the dental professional any time throughout treatment. invisalign lite ("non-comprehensive products") includes one optional case refinement in the price of the product. case refinement is a finishing tool used to adjust a patient's teeth to the desired final position and may be elected by the dental professional at any time during treatment; however, it is generally ordered in the last stages of orthodontic treatment.
we determined that our treatment plans, except invisalign assist with progress tracking, comprise the following deliverables which also represent separate units of accounting: initial aligners, additional aligners, case refinement, and replacement aligners. we allocate revenue for each treatment plan based on each unit's relative selling price based on besp and recognize the revenue upon shipment of each unit in the treatment plan.
for invisalign assist with the progress tracking feature, aligners and services are provided to the dental professional every nine stages ("a batch"). we are able to reliably estimate the number of batches which are expected to be shipped for each case based upon our historical experience. the amounts allocated to this deliverable are recognized on a prorated basis as each batch is shipped.
scanners and services we sell intraoral scanners and cad/cam services through both our direct sales force and distribution partners.  the intraoral scanner sales price includes one year of warranty, and unlimited scanning services. the customer may, for additional fees, also select extended warranty and unlimited scanning services for periods beyond the initial year. when intraoral scanners are sold with an unlimited scanning service agreement and/or extended warranty, we allocate revenue based on each element's relative selling price. we estimate the selling price of each element, as if it is sold on a stand-alone basis, taking into consideration historical prices as well as our discounting strategies.
stock-based compensation expense we recognize stock-based compensation cost for only those shares ultimately expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. we use the black-scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. we estimate the fair value of market-performance based restricted stock units using a monte carlo simulation model which requires the input of assumptions, including expected term, stock price volatility and the risk-free rate of return. in addition, judgment is required in estimating the number of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited.  forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. as a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.
goodwill and finite-lived acquired intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the respective reporting units based on relative synergies generated. for the year ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, all goodwill is attributed to our clear aligner reporting unit.
49
our intangible assets primarily consist of intangible assets acquired as part of acquisitions and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, reflecting the period in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be realized.
impairment of goodwill, finite-lived acquired intangible assets and long-lived assets goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually on november 30th or more frequently if indicators are present, an event occurs or circumstances changes that suggest an impairment may exist and that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.  the allocation of goodwill to the respective reporting unit is based on relative synergies generated as a result of an acquisition.
we perform an initial assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. in performing the qualitative assessment, we identify and consider the significance of relevant key factors, events, and circumstances that affect the fair value of our reporting units. these factors include external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as our actual and planned financial performance. we also give consideration to the difference between the reporting unit fair value and carrying value as of the most recent date a fair value measurement was performed. if, after assessing the totality of relevant events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value and there is no indication of impairment, no further testing is performed; however, if we conclude otherwise, the first step of the two-step impairment test is performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying value, including goodwill. refer to note 5 "goodwill and intangible assets" of notes to consolidated financial statements for details on intangible long-lived assets.
finite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets we evaluate long-lived assets (including finite-lived intangible assets) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. an asset or asset group is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future undiscounted net cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. if an asset or asset group is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair market value. our estimates of future cash flows attributable to our long-lived assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors. factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends, significant loss of customers and changes in the competitive environment. the estimation of fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow approach includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected growth rates and the selection of discount rates, as well as assumptions regarding general economic and business conditions, and the structure that would yield the highest economic value, among other factors. refer to note 5 "goodwill and intangible assets" of notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the impairment analysis.
accounting for income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes.
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure under the applicable tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets.
we account for uncertainty in income taxes pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit based on its technical merits, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, or refinement of estimates due to new
50
information. to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which such determination is made.
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets. should there be a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot realize our deferred tax assets. we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. if it is more likely than not that we will not realize our deferred tax assets, we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be realized.

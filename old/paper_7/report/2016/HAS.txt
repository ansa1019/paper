item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the company included in part ii item 8 of this document.
this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements concerning the companys expectations and beliefs. see item 1a forward-looking information and risk factors that may affect future results for a discussion of other uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.
unless otherwise specifically indicated, all dollar or share amounts herein are expressed in millions of dollars or shares, except for per share amounts.
the following discussion includes the companys international segment and certain regional net revenues excluding the impact of changes in exchange rates. the impact of changes in exchange rates is calculated by translating the 2016 local currency revenues at 2015 actual rates and comparing this amount to the 2016 reported revenues. management believes that the presentation of revenues excluding the impact of changes in exchange rates is helpful to an investors understanding of the performance of the underlying business absent currency fluctuations which are beyond the companys control. these measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, revenues reported in accordance with gaap as more fully discussed in the companys financial statements and filings with the securities and exchange commission.

the following chart presents net revenues by product category for each year in the three years ended december 25, 2016.
28
2016 versus 2015
net revenue growth in the boys, games and girls categories in 2016 compared to 2015 more than offset lower net revenues from the preschool category.
boys the boys category grew 4% in 2016 compared to 2015. higher net revenues from franchise brand nerf and the introduction of partner brand yo-kai watch were partially offset by lower net revenues from partner brands jurassic world and marvel and franchise brand transformers products.
within the boys category, there are a number of entertainment-based brands which, from year to year, may be supported by major theatrical releases. as such, boys category net revenues by brand fluctuate from year-to-year depending on movie popularity, release dates and related product line offerings and success. in 2016, two partner brands in the boys category were supported by major theatrical releases  star wars was supported by star wars: the force awakens released during the fourth quarter of 2015, along with the december 2016 release, rogue one: a star wars story and marvel, despite lower overall brand revenues in 2016, was supported by the may 2016 release of captain america: civil war. these benefits were partially offset by lower 2016 net revenues from partner brand jurassic world, which was supported in 2015 with the june theatrical release of jurassic world. subsequent to june 2017, the company will no longer have the rights to sell toy products under the jurassic world brand.
games the games category grew 9% in 2016 compared to 2015. higher net revenues resulted from franchise brand magic: the gathering products as well as from other games brands, including, but not limited to, pie face, duel masters, simon, bop-it, yahtzee, trivial pursuit, dungeons & dragons, and clue products as well as the successful 2016 launch of the speak-out game. these higher net revenues were partially offset by lower net revenues from franchise brand monopoly products and various other games brands, including, but not limited to, trouble, twister, elefun & friends, operation and scrabble products.
girls the girls category grew 50% in 2016 compared to 2015. higher net revenues from hasbros line of disney princess and disney frozen fashion and small dolls which were introduced in 2016, as well as higher net revenues from dreamworks trolls, baby alive, easy bake, furreal friends and furby products were partially offset by lower net revenues from franchise brands nerf, littlest pet shop, my little pony and play-doh products. in 2016, the dreamworks trolls brand was supported by a theatrical release in november 2016.
preschool the preschool category declined 1% in 2016 compared to 2015. higher net revenues from franchise brand play-doh products were more than offset by lower revenues from the companys core playskool products, jurassic world, sesame street, transformers, marvel, star wars and my little pony products.
2015 versus 2014
net revenue growth in the boys, games and preschool categories in 2015 compared to 2014 more than offset lower net revenues from the girls category.
boys the boys category grew 20% in 2015 compared to 2014. higher net revenues from franchise brand nerf and partner brands marvel, star wars and jurassic world were slightly offset by lower net revenues from franchise brand transformers.
in 2015, three partner brands were supported by major theatrical releases  marvel was supported by the may 2015 release of avengers: age of ultron, jurassic world was supported by the june 2015 release of jurassic world and star wars was supported by the december 2015 release of star wars: the force awakens. these benefits were partially offset by lower 2015 net revenues from franchise brand transformers in a non-movie year as compared to 2014 with the june theatrical release of transformers: age of extinction.
games the games category grew 1% in 2015 compared to 2014. higher net revenues resulted from franchise brands magic: the gathering and monopoly as well as from other games brands, including, but not limited to, pie face, duel masters, dungeons & dragons, life, ouija, risk, rubiks, trouble and yahtzee,. these higher net revenues were almost wholly offset by lower net revenues from various other games brands, including, but not limited to, elefun & friends, jenga and taboo.
girls the girls category declined 22% in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to expected lower net revenues from furby products, as well as declines in my little pony, nerf rebelle and littlest pet shop. core my little pony revenues increased but were, however, more than offset by lower net revenues from the my little
29
pony equestria girls products. these declines were only partially offset by the first full year of net revenues from the play-doh doh vinci brand, the 2015 introduction of the disneys descendants product line and initial shipments of disney princess and disney frozen products which became available at retail in january 2016.
preschool the preschool category grew 17% in 2015 compared to 2014. higher net revenues from franchise brand play-doh and partner brands jurassic world and star wars were only partially offset by lower revenues from the companys core playskool product line. consistent with the boys category, preschool category net revenues from partner brands benefited from the strong theatrical line-up discussed above.
given the evolution of our business, with a focus on brands rather than individual products within a brand, as well as the development of our brands and our partners brands across the brand blueprint into products and entertainment that are enjoyed by girls and boys, beginning in 2017 we will report our revenues by brand portfolio: franchise brands, partner brands, hasbro gaming and emerging brands. at that time, we will cease providing a revenue breakdown by the historical categories, boys, games, girls and preschool. revenue by brand portfolio, in millions, for 2016, 2015 and 2014 is as follows:

emerging brands                 466.0          17   %                398.5         -37   %             634.4
total                        $5,019.8                             $4,447.5                          $4,277.2
hasbros total gaming category, including the hasbro gaming portfolio as reported above and all other gaming revenue, most notably magic: the gathering and monopoly, which are in the franchise brands portfolio, totaled $1,387.1 million, $1,276.5, and $1,259.8 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the company believes that its gaming portfolio is a competitive differentiator and views it in its entirety.

net revenues the chart below illustrates net revenues derived from our principal operating segments in 2016, 2015 and 2014.

u.s. and canada
2016 versus 2015
u.s. and canada segment net revenues grew 15% in 2016 compared to 2015. revenues in the u.s. and canada segment were not materially impacted by foreign currency translation. higher net revenues from the boys, games and girls categories were partially offset by lower net revenues from the preschool category.

international considering the significant changes in foreign currency, discussing fluctuations in international segment net revenues absent the impact of foreign currency translation provides a more meaningful explanation of the segments results and is included below as well as discussing actual fluctuations. to calculate the year-over-year percentage change in net revenues absent the impact of foreign currency translation, net revenues were recalculated using those foreign currency translation rates in place for the prior years comparable period.
2016 versus 2015
international segment net revenues increased approximately 11% in 2016 compared to 2015. net revenues grew in all regions. net revenues in europe, latin america and asia pacific increased 14%, 9% and 6%, respectively, in 2016 from 2015. revenues in emerging markets increased 9% in 2016. in 2016, net revenues were impacted by unfavorable currency translation of approximately $58.4 million (latin america  $37.4 million, europe  $16.0 million, asia pacific  $5.0 million). unfavorable foreign currency translation reflects the weakening of certain foreign currencies, primarily the euro and other latin american currencies compared to the u.s. dollar. absent the impact of foreign currency translation, international segment net revenues grew 14% in 2016 compared to 2015 and emerging markets increased 12%.
international segment net revenues grew in all categories during 2016. in the boys category, higher net revenues from franchise brand nerf and revenues from the introduction of partner brand yo-kai watch products were almost wholly offset by lower net revenues from marvel, jurassic world, star wars and transformers products. in the games category, higher net revenues from pie face, franchise brand magic:

2015 versus 2014
international segment net revenues declined approximately 3% in 2015 compared to 2014. net revenues grew in certain developed markets, including the united kingdom and germany; however, this was offset by declines in other markets. in emerging markets, including russia, brazil and china, net revenues declined 9% in 2015 compared to 2014. 2015 international segment net revenues included unfavorable foreign currency translation of $379.4 million (europe  $247.9 million, latin america  $105.3 million, asia pacific  $26.2 million). unfavorable foreign currency translation reflected the weakening of certain foreign currencies, primarily the euro, russian ruble, brazilian real, and other latin american currencies compared to the u.s. dollar. absent the impact of foreign currency translation, international segment net revenues grew 16% in 2015 compared to 2014. in 2015 excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net revenues grew 15% in emerging markets.
higher net revenues from the boys and preschool categories were offset by lower net revenues from the girls and games category.

entertainment and licensing
2016 versus 2015
entertainment and licensing segment net revenues increased 8% in 2016 compared to 2015. higher segment net revenues were driven by higher revenues from backflip, growth in the consumer products and digital gaming licensing groups, as well as contributions from boulder media which was acquired in july 2016. lower entertainment revenues in 2016 compared to 2015 reflect a multi-year digital distribution agreement for hasbro studios signed in 2015 which was not repeated in 2016.
2015 versus 2014
entertainment and licensing segment net revenues increased 11% in 2015 compared to 2014. higher entertainment revenues related to a multi-year digital distribution agreement for hasbro studios programming as well as slightly higher net revenues from the companys consumer product and digital licensing groups were only partially offset by lower revenues from backflip.

u.s. and canada
2016 versus 2015
u.s. and canada segment operating profit increased 21% in 2016 compared to 2015. higher operating profit reflects higher net revenues discussed above and lower intangible amortization, partially offset by higher royalties, product development, advertising, and selling, distribution and administration expenses. operating profit margin improved to 20.4% of net revenues in 2016 from 19.4% of net revenues in 2015 reflecting higher revenues providing improved expense leverage. foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on u.s. and canada operating profit in 2016.
2015 versus 2014
u.s. and canada segment operating profit increased 29% in 2015 compared to 2014. higher operating profit reflected higher net revenues discussed above as well as product mix and lower intangible amortization, partially offset by higher overheads and shipping and warehousing costs. operating profit margin improved to 19.4% of net revenues in 2015 from 16.5% of net revenues in 2014. improved operating profit margin reflects both revenue volume and product mix, including lower advertising as a percentage of net revenues. foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on u.s. and canada operating profit in 2015.
international
2016 versus 2015
international segment operating profit increased 15% in 2016 compared to 2015 and included a favorable impact from foreign exchange of $11.5 million. absent the impact of the favorable foreign currency translation, international segment operating profit grew 11%. the increase in operating profit, as reported, is primarily due to the impact of higher net revenues, partially offset by higher expense levels, primarily royalties, advertising, and selling distribution and administration expenses. operating profit margin increased to 13.4% in 2016 from 13.0% in 2015 reflecting the improved expense leverage as a result of the higher revenues.
2015 versus 2014
international segment operating profit decreased 6% in 2015 compared to 2014 and included an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of $46.7 million. absent the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation, international segment operating profit grew 12%. the decline in operating profit, as reported, was primarily due to lower net revenues, partially offset by lower advertising, shipping and warehousing, and intangible amortization. operating profit margin decreased to 13.0% in 2015 from 13.4% in 2014. the decrease in segment operating profit margin reflects lower net revenues and higher overhead costs, partially offset by lower advertising and shipping and warehousing costs.
entertainment and licensing
2016 versus 2015
entertainment and licensing segment operating profit decreased 35% in 2016 compared to 2015 and operating profit margin decreased to 18.8% of net revenues in 2016 compared to 31.4% in 2015. operating profit in the segment in 2016 was negatively impacted by a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $32.9 million related to the companys investment in backflip. the remaining decrease in the entertainment and licensing segment operating
33
profit and operating profit margin was primarily due to higher costs associated with the launch of new games from backflip and investments in the consumer products business globally. these higher costs were partially offset by the higher revenues discussed above as well as a decrease in programming amortization costs and royalties as well as lower intangible amortization expense.
2015 versus 2014
entertainment and licensing segment operating profit increased 27% in 2015 compared to 2014 and operating profit margin increased to 31.4% of net revenues in 2015 compared to 27.6% in 2014. higher entertainment revenues related to a multi-year digital distribution agreement contributed to improved operating profit. operating profit and operating profit margin also improved on lower amortization of intangibles and program production cost amortization. lower amortization of intangibles reflects certain digital gaming rights which became fully amortized during the second quarter of 2015 whereas lower program product cost amortization reflects a higher level of programming write downs occurring in the second half of 2014 compared to 2015. these increases were partially offset by higher selling, distribution and administration expenses reflecting investment in expanding the global footprint of the companys consumer products licensing teams.
other segments and corporate and eliminations in the global operations segment, operating profit of $19.4 million in 2016 compared to $12.0 million in 2015 and $15.8 million in 2014.
in corporate and eliminations, the operating loss of $98.1 million in 2016 compared to operating losses of $83.0 million in 2015 and $46.1 million in 2014.
operating costs and expenses the companys operating expenses, stated as percentages of net revenues, are illustrated below for the three fiscal years ended december 25, 2016:

selling, distribution and administration          22.1              21.6              20.9
operating expenses for 2016, 2015 and 2014 include benefits and expenses related to the following events:
                                                  during the fourth quarter of 2016 in conjunction with the companys annual review for impairment, the company completed step one of the annual goodwill impairment test and determined the fair value of the backflip reporting unit to be below its carrying value. the company then performed step two of the impairment test and determined the carrying value of goodwill exceeded its implied fair value.
based on those results, the company recognized an impairment charge of $32.9 million related to backflip in the fourth quarter of 2016.

   in august 2015, the company finalized the sale of its manufacturing operations in east longmeadow, ma and waterford, ireland. this transaction resulted in a benefit to selling, distribution and administration expenses of $3.1 million.

                                                      in september 2014, the company and discovery amended their relationship with respect to discovery family channel (the network). prior to the amendment, the company had a license agreement with the network that required payment of royalties by the company to the network based on a percentage of revenue derived from products related to television shows broadcast on the network. this agreement included a minimum royalty guarantee of $125.0 million, which has been paid in full. as part of the amended relationship, this earn-out period was extended to 2021 resulting in a benefit of $2.3 million to royalties for the year ended december 28, 2014. furthermore, this amended relationship resulted in an amendment to the companys tax sharing agreement with discovery which resulted in a net expense of $0.9 million recorded to selling, distribution and administration expense for the year ended december 28, 2014.

   during 2014, the company recognized charges totaling $5.2 million primarily related to employee severance charges which impacted selling, distribution, and administration expenses.

total                                            $32.9           (3.1   )            3.8
cost of sales cost of sales primarily consists of purchased materials, labor, tooling, manufacturing overheads and other inventory-related costs such as obsolescence. cost of sales increased 14% to $1,905.5 million, or 38.0% of net revenues, for the year ended december 25, 2016 compared to $1,677.0 million, or 37.7% of net revenues, for the year ended december 27, 2015. increased cost of sales in dollars reflects the overall increase in net revenues and product and revenue mix. product mix partially reflects higher net revenues from royalty-bearing products which generally carry higher pricing and, therefore, have a lower cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues however the lower cost of sales on royalty-bearing products is offset by higher royalty expense. in 2016, the following entertainment-driven, royalty-bearing brands were supported by major theatrical releases: star wars, dreamworks trolls and marvel. likewise, revenue mix reflects lower net revenue contributions from the companys entertainment and licensing segment as a percentage of overall sales. in 2016, entertainment and licensing segment net revenues were 5.3% of consolidated net revenues compared to 5.5% in 2015.
in 2015, cost of sales decreased 1% to $1,677.0 million, or 37.7% of net revenues, for the year ended december 27, 2015 compared to $1,698.4 million, or 39.7% of net revenues, for the year ended december 28, 2014 despite consolidated net revenue growth of 4%. lower cost of sales in dollars and as a percent of net revenues reflects both product and revenue mix. product mix reflects higher net revenues from royalty-bearing products. in 2015, the following entertainment-driven, royalty-bearing brands were supported by major theatrical releases: jurassic world, marvel and star wars. likewise, revenue mix reflected higher net revenue contributions from the companys entertainment and licensing segment. in 2015, entertainment and licensing segment net revenues were 5.5% of consolidated net revenues compared to 5.1% in 2014.
royalty expense royalty expense of $409.5 million, or 8.2% of net revenues, in 2016 compared to $379.2 million, or 8.5% of net revenues, in 2015 and $305.3 million, or 7.1% of net revenues, in 2014. fluctuations in royalty expense generally relate to the volume of entertainment-driven products sold in a given period, especially if there is a major motion picture release. product lines related to hasbro-owned or controlled brands supported by entertainment generally do not incur the same level of royalty expense as licensed properties, particularly disney, dreamworks, star wars, marvel and yo-kai watch products and certain licensed properties carry higher royalty rates than other licensed properties. higher royalty expense in dollars, but lower royalty expense as a percentage of net revenues in 2016 compared to 2015, reflects the mix of entertainment-driven product sold. in particular, higher royalty expense in dollars in 2016 compared to 2015 reflects the mix of licensed properties sold with higher net sales of disney, dreamworks, and yo-kai watch products partially offset by lower net sales of jurrasic world, marvel and star wars royalty-bearing movie products in 2016 compared to 2015. higher royalty expense as a percent of net revenues in 2015 compared to 2014 also reflected the mix of entertainment products sold. in particular, higher net sales of marvel, jurassic world and star wars products partially offset by lower sales of transformers products.
product development product development expense in 2016 totaled $266.4 million, or 5.3% of net revenues, compared to $242.9 million, or 5.5% of net revenues, in 2015. the increase in product development expense in dollars primarily reflects the companys continued investment in innovation and anticipated growth across our brand portfolio in both franchise and partner brands. the decrease as a percentage of sales primarily represents increased leverage resulting from higher revenues as well as costs in 2015 relating to the development of the disney princess and disney frozen lines.
35
product development expense in 2015 totaled $242.9 million, or 5.5% of net revenues, compared to $222.6 million, or 5.2% of net revenues, in 2014. the increase in product development expense primarily reflects development costs incurred related to the disney princess and disney frozen license agreement. these higher expenses were not offset by related revenues as initial product shipments did not commence until late in the fourth quarter of 2015 in preparation for the january 1, 2016 retail on-shelf date. additionally, the company continued to incur product development expenses related to the development of a new digital platform for magic: the gathering and the development of new mobile game offerings by backflip.
advertising expense advertising expense in 2016 totaled $468.9 million compared to $409.4 million in 2015 and $420.3 million in 2014. the level of the companys advertising expense is generally impacted by revenue mix, the amount and type of theatrical releases, and television programming. advertising as a percentage of net revenues increased slightly to 9.3% in 2016 from 9.2% in 2015. the year-over-year increase in advertising expense in dollars primarily reflects the growth in revenue.
advertising expense in 2015 decreased as a percentage of revenues to 9.2% from 9.8% in 2014. the decrease reflected the mix of revenues, primarily the higher level of partner brand revenues, which contained entertainment backed product lines such as star wars and jurrasic world which require less advertising.
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles totaled $34.8 million, or 0.7% of net revenues, in 2016 compared to $43.7 million, or 1.0% of net revenues, in 2015 and $52.7 million, or 1.2% of net revenues in 2014. lower amortization of intangibles in 2016 compared to 2015 reflects the impact of intangible assets, primarily digital gaming rights, which were fully amortized during 2015. lower amortization of intangibles in 2015 compared to 2014 also reflects the impact of intangible assets which were fully amortized during 2014 and 2015.
program product cost amortization program production cost amortization totaled $35.9 million, or 0.7% of net revenues in 2016, compared to $42.4 million, or 1.0% of net revenues, in 2015 and $47.1 million, or 1.1% of net revenues, in 2014. program production costs are capitalized as incurred and amortized using the individual-film-forecast method. program production cost amortization reflects the level of revenues associated with television programming as well as the type of television programs produced and distributed. the decrease in program production cost amortization in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the timing of new programing deliveries and a lower number of television programs being amortized in 2016. in addition, higher revenues in 2015 primarily due to the multi-year digital distribution agreement contributed to a higher 2015 expense level. the decrease in program production cost amortization in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a lower amount of accelerated amortization in 2015 as compared to 2014.
selling, distribution and administration expenses selling, distribution and administration expenses were $1,110.8 million, or 22.1% of net revenues, in 2016 compared to $960.8 million, or 21.6% of net revenues, in 2015. selling, distribution and administration expense for 2016 includes a charge of $32.9 million related to a non-cash goodwill impairment charge to backflip recorded in december while 2015 includes a benefit of $3.1 million related to the august 2015 sale of the companys manufacturing operations. absent this charge in 2016 and benefit in 2015, selling, distribution and administration expenses increased to $1,077.9, or 21.5% of net revenues, in 2016 from $963.9 million, or 21.7% of net revenues in 2015. the increase in dollars is primarily due to higher performance-based stock compensation, higher depreciation, higher selling and distribution costs related to the higher revenues and higher bad debt expense related to an uncollectible account in the international segment partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange translation. the decrease as a percentage of revenues, excluding onetime charges and benefits, represents improved expense leverage as the result of the increased revenues in 2016.
selling, distribution and administration expenses were $960.8 million, or 21.6% of net revenues, in 2015 compared to $895.5 million, or 20.9% of net revenues, in 2014. selling, distribution and administration expense for 2014 includes a charge of $6.1 million related to the companys restructuring activities, including the companys equity investment in the joint venture television network. absent these charges, as well as the 2015 benefit discussed above, selling, distribution and administration expenses increased to $963.9 million or 21.7% of net revenues, in 2015 from $889.4 million, or 20.8% of net revenues in 2014. foreign exchange resulted in a decrease of
36
$66.7 million in 2015 compared to 2014. excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the impact of the benefits and charges discussed above, selling, distribution and administration costs increased primarily due to higher administration, marketing and sales and distribution costs. higher 2015 administration and sales and marketing expenses are primarily the result of higher performance-based stock compensation, investments in the magic: the gathering brand, depreciation expense and other general cost increases, such as salaries and wages. higher distribution costs reflect increased net revenues in 2015, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
non-operating (income) expense interest expense interest expense totaled $97.4 million in 2016 compared to $97.1 million in 2015 and $93.1 million in 2014. interest expense in 2016 was consistent with the companys 2015 interest expense. the increase in interest expense in 2015 primarily reflects the impact of costs related to forward-starting interest rate swap contracts on the 2014 debt issuance compared to a benefit on interest rate hedges which expired in 2014.
interest income interest income was $9.4 million in 2016 compared to $3.1 million in 2015 and $3.8 million in 2015. higher interest income in 2016 compared to 2015 reflects higher invested cash balances and higher average interest rates. decreased interest income in 2015 compared to 2014 reflects lower average interest rates which were only partially offset by higher average cash balances.
other expense (income), net other expense, net of $7.5 million in 2016 compared to other income, net of $6.0 million in 2015 and other expense, net of $6.0 million in 2014. the following table outlines major contributors to other (income) expense, net.

                                         foreign currency losses increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to higher losses in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the weakening of certain currencies, primarily the euro, against the u.s. dollar. foreign currency losses decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher losses in the fourth quarter of 2014 due to the rapid strengthening of the u.s. dollar.

   earnings from the discovery joint venture are comprised of the companys share in the results of the network.

   in august 2015, the company sold its manufacturing operations in east longmeadow, ma and waterford, ireland which resulted in the recognition of a gain of $6.6
million in other (income) expense, net.

                     the 2014 gain on the sale of certain assets reflects gains of $36.0 million related to the sale of certain intellectual property license rights and $3.4 million related to the sale of an internet domain name. the 2015 gain includes additional proceeds related to the sale of those intellectual property license rights sold during the fourth quarter of 2014.

        in september 2014, the company and discovery amended their relationship with respect to the network. the 2014 loss consists of the companys share of restructuring costs recorded by the network, partially offset by a gain resulting from the reduction of amounts due to discovery under a tax sharing agreement.

   the 2016 gain on investments primarily reflects proceeds from the sale of certain long-term investments sold during the year.

income taxes income tax expense totaled 23.0% of pretax earnings in 2016 compared with 26.0% in 2015 and 23.5% in 2014. income tax expense for 2016 includes net benefits of approximately $12.0 million from discrete events, primarily related to the expiration of the statute of limitations for tax audits and settlements of exams in certain jurisdictions. income tax expense for 2015 includes net benefits of approximately $4.0 million from discrete tax events, primarily related to the expiration of the statute of limitations for tax audits in various international jurisdictions. income tax expense for 2014 includes net benefits of approximately $20.0 million from discrete tax events, primarily related to the effective settlement of certain open tax years in the united states and the settlement of tax examinations in certain jurisdictions, including mexico. absent these items and potential interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions recorded in 2016, 2015 and 2014, the effective tax rates would have been 24.5%, 26.4% and 26.5%, respectively. the decrease in the adjusted tax rate from 2014 to 2015 and decrease from 2015 to 2016 primarily reflect the change in the geographic mix of where the company earned its profits.
new accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb), in cooperation with the international accounting standards board (iasb), issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (asc 606). this asu supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in accounting standards codification 605  revenue recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the codification. this new guidance provides a five-step model for analyzing contracts and transactions to determine when, how and if revenue is recognized. revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. this asu is now effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2017, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, and may be adopted early but not before december 15, 2016. the company expects to adopt this standard in fiscal 2018 and has not yet determined which transition method will be utilized. while the company is still in the process of completing its evaluation of its various revenue streams and processes relating to the requirements of asu 2014-09, based on the analysis performed to date, the company does not expect the adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on the companys results or financial statements. certain contracts within the entertainment & licensing segment may be impacted as well as certain isolated transactions within the us & canada and international segments but this impact is not expected to be material to the financial statements of the company.
in february 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-02, leases (topic 842) (asu 2016-02), which will require lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for virtually all of their leases. the liability will be based on the present value of lease payments and the asset will be based on the liability. for income statement purposes, a dual model was retained requiring leases to be either classified as operating or finance. operating leases will result in straight-line expense while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures will be required. asu 2016-02 is required for public companies for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018 and must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition. the company is evaluating the requirements of asu 2016-02 and its potential impact on the companys financial statements. the company has a significant number of leases globally, primarily for property and office equipment, and is in the process of identifying and evaluating these leases in relation to the requirements of asu 2016-02. for each of these leases, the term will be evaluated, including extension and renewal options as well as the lease payments associated with the leases. the company does not expect that its results of operations will be materially impacted by this standard. the company expects to record assets and liabilities on its balance sheets upon adoption of this standard, which may be material. the adoption of this standard will not have an impact on the companys cash flows.
in march 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-09, improvements to employee share-based payment accounting, which amends asc topic 718, compensation  stock compensation. the asu includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements including (1) a requirement to record all of the tax effects related to share-based payments at settlement (or expiration) through the income statement; (2) a requirement that all tax-related cash flows resulting from share-based payments be reported as operating activities on the statement of cash flows; (3) the removal of the requirement to withhold shares upon settlement of an award at the minimum statutory withholding requirement; (4) a requirement that all cash payments made to taxing authorities on the employees behalf for withheld shares shall be presented as financing activities in the statements of cash flows; and (5) entities will be permitted to make an accounting policy election for the impact of forfeitures on the recognition of expense for share-based payment awards choosing either to estimate forfeitures as required today or recognize forfeitures as they occur. asu 2016-09 is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016, and interim periods within that reporting period. the company will adopt asu 2016-09 in the
38
first quarter of 2017. under the new standard, the company will elect to recognize forfeitures as they occur. based upon the companys history of forfeitures, it is not expected that this election will have a material impact on its financial statements however, as any impact will be based on future forfeitures, the actual impact could differ from the companys expectation. the impact of the other aspects of asu 2016-09 are based on the companys future stock price at the date of vesting or exercise of share-based payments as well as the timing of exercises and, as such, the company cannot estimate the impact of these aspects, other than to expect that the adoption of this standard will benefit our future tax expense in the short term, the extent to which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, nor can we estimate whether such benefits will continue or will result in increased tax expense in the longer term.
in july 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-11, simplifying the measurement of inventory (asu 2015-11), which replaces the concept of market price with the single measurement of net realizable value. asu 2015-11 is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2016 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2017. the company has evaluated the requirements of asu 2015-11 and does not believe that the adoption of the new standard will have a material impact on the companys results or financial statements.
in august 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-15, statement of cash flows (asc 230)  classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments. the new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice across all industries, in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. asu 2016-15 is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2017. the company has evaluated the requirements of asu 2016-15 and does not presently believe that the adoption of the new standard will have a material impact on the companys results or financial statements.
in october 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2016- 16 (asu 2016-16), accounting for income taxes: intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. for public companies, this standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. the standard requires that the income tax impact of intra-entity sales and transfers of property, except for inventory, be recognized when the transfer occurs requiring any deferred taxes not yet recognized on intra-entity transfers to be recorded to retained earnings. the company is currently evaluating the standard, but expects that it will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in january 2017, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2017- 04 (asu 2017-04), intangibles -goodwill and other (topic 350): simplifying the test for goodwill impairment. the standard eliminates the requirement to measure the implied fair value of goodwill by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all assets and liabilities within that unit (the step 2 test) from the goodwill impairment test. instead, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited by the amount of goodwill in that reporting unit. for public companies, this standard is effective and must be applied to annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests beginning after december 15, 2019. early adoption is permitted. we are currently evaluating the standard, but expect that it will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically generated a significant amount of cash from operations. in 2016 the company funded its operations and liquidity needs primarily through cash flows from operations, and, when needed, using borrowings under its available lines of credit and its commercial paper program. during 2017, the company expects to continue to fund its working capital needs primarily through cash flows from operations and, when needed, by issuing commercial paper or borrowing under its revolving credit agreement. in the event that the company is not able to issue commercial paper, the company intends to utilize its available lines of credit. the company believes that the funds available to it, including cash expected to be generated from operations and funds available through its commercial paper program or its available lines of credit are adequate to meet its working capital needs for 2017, however, unexpected events or circumstances such as material operating losses or increased capital or other expenditures, or inability to otherwise access the commercial paper market, may reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources. in addition, significant disruptions to credit markets may also reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources. although the company believes the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to its financial facilities is not significant, in times of severe economic downturn in the credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to the company.

as of december 25, 2016, the companys cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,282.3 million, substantially all of which is held by international subsidiaries. deferred income taxes have not been provided on the majority of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as such earnings are indefinitely reinvested by the company. accordingly, such international cash balances are not available to fund cash requirements in the united states unless the company changes its reinvestment policy. the company has sufficient sources of cash in the united states to fund cash requirements without the need to repatriate any funds. if the company changes its policy of permanently reinvesting international earnings, it would be required to accrue for any additional income taxes representing the difference between the tax rates in the united states and the applicable tax rates of the international subsidiaries. if the company repatriated the funds from its international subsidiaries, it would then be required to pay the additional u.s. income tax. the majority of the companys cash and cash equivalents held outside of the united states as of december 25, 2016 is denominated in the u.s. dollar.
in 2016, 2015 and 2014, hasbro generated $774.9 million, $552.4 million and $454.4 million of cash from its operating activities, respectively. operating cash flows in 2016, 2015 and 2014 included $48.7 million, $42.5 million and $31.4 million, respectively, of cash used for television program and film production.

accounts receivable, net increased 8% in 2016 compared to 2015. excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, accounts receivable, net, increased 11% reflecting revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2016, excluding unfavorable foreign currency translation, of 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. days sales outstanding decreased to 73 days at december 25, 2016 from 75 days at december 27, 2015. accounts receivable, net increased 11% in 2015 compared to 2014. excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, accounts receivable, net increased 23% in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting 23% revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2015, excluding unfavorable foreign currency translation, compared to 2014. days sales outstanding decreased to 75 days at december 27, 2015 from 76 days at december 28, 2014.
inventories increased 1% at the end of 2016 compared to 2015. excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, inventories increased 2% in 2016 compared to 2015. the slight increase in inventories, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, is primarily due to higher levels in the latin america and europe regions to support growth in the business. inventories increased by 13% in 2015 compared to 2014 and 24% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. the increase was due to higher levels in the united states and europe in support of 2016 initiatives and growth in the business.
prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased 17% in 2016 compared to 2015. the majority of the decrease is due to a decrease in the value of foreign exchange contracts in 2016 compared to 2015 and, to a lesser extent, reduced prepaid royalties. prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased 9% in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase in favorable foreign currency hedge contracts and amounts due from cartamundi related to the sale of the companys manufacturing operations were more than offset by lower royalty advances and non-income based tax receivables, primarily value-added taxes in europe.
goodwill and other intangible assets, net decreased to $816.5 million at december 25, 2016 from $873.5 million at december 27, 2015 and $918.0 million at december 28, 2014. the decrease in 2016 was due to a non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the amount of $32.9 million related to backflip and amortization of intangible assets. the decrease in 2015 from 2014 was due to amortization of intangible assets.
40
other assets increased 5% in 2016 compared to 2015. increases in deferred taxes, foreign exchange contracts and other receivables were partially offset by decreases in royalty advances and a payment reducing amounts due from cartamundi related to the sale of the companys manufacturing operations in 2015. other assets increased approximately 3% in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase primarily reflects long-term amounts due from cartamundi related to the sale of the companys manufacturing operations as well as higher long-term receivables related to multi-year television distribution agreements. these increases were partially offset by lower long-term royalty advances.
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased 22% in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to increased accounts payable due to timing of payments, higher accrued royalties for licensed properties reflecting 2016s stronger entertainment line-up and utilization of guarantee payments compared to 2015 as well as higher accrued income taxes due to higher fourth quarter earnings, higher accrued advertising due to lower levels of advertising in the fourth quarter of 2015 and increased foreign exchange currency liability related to certain strengthening foreign currencies in 2016. accounts payable and accrued expenses increased approximately 10% in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase was primarily due to higher accrued royalties for licensed properties reflecting 2015s stronger entertainment line-up compared to 2014 as well as higher accrued performance-based compensation reflecting the companys overall performance. these increases were partially offset by lower accrued advertising.
other liabilities decreased 4% in 2016 compared to 2015. the decrease is primarily due to a $62 million contribution made to the companys u.s. pension plan in 2016 partially offset by an increase in the pension liability reflecting changes in actuarial assumptions, primarily lower discount rates, and an increase in the liability for uncertain tax positions. other liabilities increased 3% in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase primarily reflects higher uncertain tax positions partially offset by a reduction in pension liabilities reflecting changes in actuarial assumptions, primarily due to higher discount rates.
cash flows utilized by investing activities were $138.4 million, $103.6 million and $0.5 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. additions to property, plant and equipment increased in 2016 to $154.9 million from $142.0 million and $113.4 in 2015 and 2014, respectively. of these additions, 57% in 2016, 54% in 2015 and 60% in 2014 were for purchases of tools, dies and molds related to the companys products. absent the companys investment in tools, dies and molds, higher capital expenditures reflect the companys investment in information systems as well as new office space for hasbro studios. in 2017, the company expects capital expenditures to be in the range of $130.0 million to $160.0 million. during the three years ended december 25, 2016, the depreciation of plant and equipment was $119.7 million, $111.6 million and $105.3 million, respectively. fluctuations in depreciation of plant and equipment correlate with the percentage of additions to property, plant and equipment relating to tools, dies and molds which have shorter useful lives and accelerated depreciation. excluding capital expenditures, 2016 proceeds from investing activities includes $19.8 million in capital and tax distributions from discovery family channel and $6.4 million received on the installment note relating to the sale of the companys manufacturing operations in 2015 partially offset by utilization of $12.4 million to purchase the net assets of boulder in july of 2016. 2015 proceeds from investing activities, excluding capital expenditures, reflects $18.6 million related to the sale of the companys manufacturing operations and $20.7 million in capital and tax distributions from discovery family channel. the 2014 utilization related to capital expenditures is almost wholly offset by $64.4 million of cash received from discovery from the partial sale of the companys equity interest in the network and $36.0 million of cash received from the sale of certain intellectual property licensing rights which was included in other investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
the company commits to inventory production, advertising and marketing expenditures prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season. accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in their holiday selling season. due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period, payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year. this timing difference between expenditures and cash collections on accounts receivable makes it necessary for the company to borrow higher amounts during the latter part of the year. during 2016, 2015 and 2014, the company primarily used cash from operations and borrowings under its commercial paper program and available lines of credit.
the company has an agreement with a group of banks which provides for a commercial paper program (the program). under the program, at the request of the company and subject to market conditions, the banks may either purchase from the company, or arrange for the sale by the company, of unsecured commercial paper notes. the company may issue notes from time to time up to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any given time of $700.0 million. the maturities of the notes may vary but may not exceed 397 days. the notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are issued at a discount to par, or alternatively, sold at par and bear varying interest rates based on a fixed or floating rate basis. the interest rates vary based on market
41
conditions and the ratings assigned to the notes by the credit rating agencies at the time of issuance. borrowings under the program are supported by the companys $700.0 million revolving credit agreement. at december 25, 2016, the company had $163.3 million in borrowings outstanding related to the program.
the company has a revolving credit agreement (the agreement) which provides the company with a $700.0 million committed borrowing facility. the agreement contains certain financial covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility, including with respect to liens, mergers and incurrence of indebtedness. the company was in compliance with all covenants in the agreement as of and for the fiscal year ended december 25, 2016. the company had no borrowings outstanding under its committed revolving credit facility at december 25, 2016. however, letters of credit outstanding under this facility as of december 25, 2016 were approximately $0.8 million. amounts available and unused under the committed line at december 25, 2016 were approximately $535.9 million, inclusive of borrowings under the companys commercial paper program. the company also has other uncommitted lines from various banks, of which approximately $50.7 million was utilized at december 25, 2016. of the amount utilized under, or supported by, the uncommitted lines, approximately $9.4 million and $41.3 million represent outstanding short-term borrowings and letters of credit, respectively.
net cash utilized by financing activities was $333.1 million, $346.5 million, and $231.0 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the 2014 utilization includes net proceeds from the issuance and repayment of long-term debt totaling $135.0 million. in 2014, the company issued an aggregate $600.0 million in long-term notes which were partially utilized to re-pay the $425.0 million in long-term notes due in may 2014. of the amounts utilized in 2016, 2015 and 2014, $150.1, $87.2 million, and $459.6 million, respectively, reflects cash paid, including transaction costs, to repurchase the companys common stock. during 2016, 2015 and 2014, the company repurchased 1.9 million, 1.2 million, and 8.5 million shares, respectively, at an average price of $79.86, $68.01, and $54.26, respectively. at december 25, 2016, $328.0 million remained for share repurchases under the february 2015 board authorization. dividends paid were $248.9 million in 2016, $225.8 million in 2015 and $216.9 million in 2014. the company has increased its quarterly dividend rate from $0.43 in 2014 to $0.46 in 2015 and $0.51 in 2016. proceeds from short-term borrowings of $9.0 million in 2016 compared to repayments of short-term borrowings of $87.3 million in 2015 and proceeds of $246.1 million in 2014. the company generated cash from employee stock option transactions of $62.7 million, $57.6 million, and $71.4 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
in may 2014, the company issued $600.0 million in long-term debt consisting of $300.0 million in 3.15% notes due 2021 and $300.0 million in 5.10% notes due 2044 (collectively, the notes). the company may redeem the notes at its option at the greater of the principal amount of the notes or the present value of the remaining scheduled payments using the effective interest rate on applicable u.s. treasury bills at the time of repurchase. the proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used, primarily, to repay $425.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 6.125% notes due 2014 upon maturity, including accrued and unpaid interest. the remaining net proceeds were utilized for general corporate and working capital purposes.
for the $350.0 million in notes due in 2017 which bear interest at 6.30%, interest rates may be adjusted upward in the event that the companys credit rating from moodys investor services, inc., standard & poors ratings services or fitch ratings is reduced to ba1, bb+, or bb+, respectively, or below. at december 25, 2016, the companys ratings from moodys investor services, inc., standard & poors ratings services and fitch ratings were baa1, bbb and bbb+, respectively. the interest rate adjustment is dependent on the degree of decrease of the companys ratings and could range from 0.25% to a maximum of 2.00%. the company may redeem the notes at its option at the greater of the principal amount of the notes or the present value of the remaining scheduled payments discounted using the effective interest rate on applicable u.s. treasury bills at the time of repurchase. the company currently expects to refinance the $350.0 million notes upon maturity in 2017, either via a bond issuance or via our commercial paper program.
including the notes described above, as well as certain notes due 2040 and debentures due 2028, the company has principal amounts of long-term debt at december 25, 2016 of approximately $1,559.9 million due at varying times from 2017 through 2044. the company also had letters of credit and other similar instruments of $42.1 million and 2017 purchase commitments of $406.1 million outstanding at december 25, 2016. in addition, the company expects to be committed to guaranteed royalty payments of approximately $83.6 million in 2016, including $40.0 million contingent on theatrical movie releases.
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. as such, management is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available. these estimates and assumptions
42
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the companys reported financial results include sales allowances, program production costs, recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, recoverability of royalty advances and commitments, pension costs and obligations and income taxes.
sales allowances sales allowances for customer promotions, discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized. revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer, generally at the time of shipment. revenue from product sales, less related sales allowances along with license fees and royalty revenue comprise net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. the company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers. these allowances primarily relate to fixed programs, which the customer earns based on purchases of company products during the year. discounts and allowances are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale. while many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts, certain of the allowances, such as the returns allowance, are based on market data, historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation.
for its allowance programs that are not fixed, such as returns, the company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions. these estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues. during 2016, there were no material adjustments to the companys estimates made in prior years.
program production costs the company incurs certain costs in connection with the production of television programs and films based primarily on the companys toy and game brands. these costs are capitalized as they are incurred and amortized using the individual-film-forecast method, whereby these costs are amortized in the proportion that the current years revenues bear to managements estimate of total ultimate revenues as of the beginning of each fiscal year related to the program. these capitalized costs are reported at the lower of cost, less accumulated amortization, or fair value, and reviewed for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates that impairment may exist. the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily based on managements future revenue and cost estimates.
the most significant estimates are those used in the determination of ultimate revenue in the individual-film-forecast method. ultimate revenue estimates impact the timing of program production cost amortization in the consolidated statements of operations. ultimate revenue includes revenue from all sources that are estimated to be earned related to the film or television program and include toy, game and other consumer product licensing fees; first run program distribution fees; and other revenue sources, such as dvd and digital distribution. our ultimate revenue estimates for each film or television program are developed based on our estimates of expected future results. we review and revise these estimates at each reporting date to reflect the most current available information. when estimates for a film or television program are revised, the difference between the program production cost amortization determined using the revised estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year, are included as an adjustment to program production cost amortization in the consolidated statements of operations in the quarter in which the estimates are revised. prior period amounts are not adjusted for subsequent changes in estimates. factors that can impact our revenue estimates include the success and popularity of our films and television programs in the u.s. which are primarily distributed on discovery family channel, globally to other broadcasters and available on netflix and itunes, and success of our program-related toy, game and other merchandise.
for the year ended december 25, 2016 we have $82.8 million of program production and film costs included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. we currently expect that a significant portion of capitalized program production costs will be amortized over the 3-year period 2017 through 2019. future program production cost amortization is subject to change based on actual costs incurred and managements then current estimates of ultimate revenues. during 2016 and 2014 the company recorded accelerated amortization on certain television programming based on revised ultimate expected revenues.
recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually. if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, the

company will perform an interim test at that time. the company may perform a qualitative assessment and bypass the quantitative two-step impairment process if it is not more likely than not that impairment exists.
performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill requires a high degree of judgment regarding assumptions underlying the valuation. qualitative factors and their impact on critical inputs are assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. if it is more likely than not that impairment exists, the quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test is performed. when performing the quantitative two-step impairment test, goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is calculated using an income approach. during the fourth quarter of 2016, the company performed a qualitative assessment with respect to certain of its reporting units with goodwill totaling $473.6 million. the company utilized this approach for all reporting units with the exception of backflip based on the amount by which historical estimated reporting unit fair values exceeded carrying values. based on its qualitative assessment, the company concluded that there was no impairment of this goodwill, excluding backflip, during 2016.
as of december 27, 2015, the company had $119.1 million of goodwill related to its 2013 acquisition of backflip, which represents a separate reporting unit. the companys strategy when it purchased its interest in backflip was to produce game titles based on backflips dragonvale brand and to develop and market games based on hasbro brands. because backflip was a recent acquisition and to date had been investment spending in anticipation of 2016 game releases, the company performed the quantitative two-step impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2015 for this reporting unit. at that time, the company concluded that there was no goodwill impairment related to backflip. during the fourth quarter of 2016 in conjunction with the companys annual review for impairment, we completed step one of the annual goodwill impairment test for the backflip reporting unit. prior to the fourth quarter of 2016, there were no triggering events that would have required the company to complete an impairment test. our evaluation of the current year performance of the backflip reporting unit was dependent in large part on the performance of launches that took place during the fourth quarter. additionally, during the fourth quarter, we revised our expectations regarding the timing of future launches. the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis involved comparing the backflip carrying value to its estimated fair value, which was calculated based on the income approach. discounted cash flows serve as the primary basis for the income approach. the company utilized forecasted cash flows for the backflip reporting unit that included assumptions including but not limited to: expected revenues to be realized based on planned future mobile game releases; expected ebitda margins derived in part based on expected future royalty costs, advertising and marketing costs, development costs, and overhead costs; and expected future tax rates. the cash flows beyond the forecast period were estimated using a terminal value growth rate of 3%. to calculate the fair value of the future cash flows under the income approach, a discount rate of 14% was utilized, representing the reporting units estimated weighted-average cost of capital. based on the results of the step one impairment test the company determined that the fair value of the backflip reporting unit was below its carrying value, and therefore, impairment was indicated. because indicators of impairment existed, the company commenced the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis to determine the implied fair value of goodwill for the backflip reporting unit, which was determined in the same manner utilized to estimate the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. as part of the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis, the company assigned the fair value of the backflip reporting unit, as calculated under the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis, to all the assets and liabilities, including identifiable intangibles assets, of that reporting unit. the implied fair value of goodwill was measured as the excess of the fair value of the backflip reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities. based on this assessment, the company recorded an impairment charge of $32.9 million. should backflip not achieve its profitability and growth targets, including the anticipated game releases in 2017 and beyond, or if industry discount rates significantly increase, the carrying value of this reporting unit may become further impaired. at december 25, 2016, there is $86.3 million of remaining goodwill related to the backflip reporting unit.
during the third quarter of 2016, the company acquired boulder media, an animation studio based in dublin, ireland. based on the companys analysis, goodwill in the amount of $11.8 million was recorded and is reflected in the entertainment and licensing segment. due to the timing of the acquisition in conjunction with the companys annual impairment review it was concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill in 2016 related to boulder media.
the company also performed quantitative annual impairment tests related to intangible assets totaling $75.7 million with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of 2016 and no impairments were indicated as the estimated fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values of the related assets.
the estimation of future cash flows utilized in the evaluation of the companys goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective
44
asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge.
intangible assets, other than those with indefinite lives, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. if such assets were considered to be impaired, the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows. the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective assets and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. intangible assets covered under this policy were $170.2 million at december 25, 2016. during 2016, there were no impairment charges related to these intangible assets.
recoverability of royalty advances and commitments the companys ability to earn-out royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product. if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or, if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments, a charge to royalty expense to write-off the non-recoverable minimum guaranty is required if advanced, or if not advanced, an expense is recorded to accrue the shortfall. the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates. actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties. at december 25, 2016, the company had $102.8 million of prepaid royalties, $34.1 million of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $68.7 million of which are included in other assets.
pension costs and obligations pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets and applicable discount rates. at the end of 2007 the company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in the u.s., with no future benefits accruing to employees. during 2015 the company froze benefits under its other funded u.s. pension plan. the company will continue to pay benefits under the plans consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze.
the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan, the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes, and the current economic environment. based on this information, the companys estimate of expected return on plan assets used in the calculation of 2016 pension expense for the u.s. plans was 6.75%. a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense, while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense. a decrease of 0.25% in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2016 pension expense for u.s. plans by approximately $0.7 million.
discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. the companys weighted average discount rate for its u.s. plans used for the calculation of 2016 pension expense was 4.58%. a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense. a decrease of 0.25% in the companys discount rate would have increased 2016 pension expense by approximately $1.0 million.
actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and, if outside a certain corridor, amortized over future periods and, therefore affect recognized expense in future periods. at december 25, 2016, the companys u.s. plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of $140.9 million included in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to its defined benefit pension plans compared to $120.5 million at december 27, 2015.
45
the discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation at december 25, 2016 decreased to 4.22% from 4.58% used at december 27, 2015. a decrease of 0.25% in the companys discount rate would have increased the 2016 projected benefit obligation by approximately $11.8 million. pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date. these changes in the fair market value of plan assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses or gains.
income taxes the companys annual income tax rate is based on its income, statutory tax rates, changes in prior tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the companys annual tax rate and evaluate its tax positions. despite the companys belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable, these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities are established in the event that these positions are challenged and the company is not successful in defending these challenges. these estimated liabilities, as well as the related interest, are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit.
an estimated effective income tax rate is applied to the companys interim results. in the event there is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the companys interim results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time. in addition, changes in judgment regarding likely outcomes related to tax positions taken in a prior fiscal year, or tax costs or benefits from a resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely in the interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs. during 2016, 2015 and 2014, the company recorded net benefits of approximately $12.0 million, $4.0 million and $20.0 million, respectively associated with discrete tax events excluding any potential interest and penalties.
in certain cases, tax law requires items to be included in the companys income tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized on the consolidated financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized on the consolidated financial statements. some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the companys tax returns, while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. these differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. deferred tax assets represent deductions that have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the companys income tax returns. valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the company will have insufficient future taxable income, including capital gains, to fully realize the future deductions or capital losses. deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized on the companys income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the companys consolidated financial statements or income recognized in the consolidated financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the companys income tax return. deferred income taxes have not been provided on most of the undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as most of such earnings are indefinitely reinvested by the company. in the event the company determines that such earnings will not be indefinitely reinvested, it would be required to accrue for any additional income taxes representing the difference between the tax rates in the united states and the applicable tax rates of the international subsidiaries. at december 25, 2016, the difference between the tax in the united states and the applicable tax of the international subsidiaries on cumulative undistributed earnings was approximately $641.0 million.

financial risk management the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in u.s. dollars and hong kong dollars while marketing and selling those products in more than twenty currencies. results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the u.s. dollar, hong kong dollar, euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, brazilian real, russian ruble and mexican peso and, to a lesser extent, other currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries.
to manage this exposure, the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts. the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10% depreciation of the u.s. dollar against all foreign currencies included in these foreign exchange forward contracts could result in an approximate $97.6 million decrease in the fair value of these instruments. a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the value of the forecasted foreign currency transactions.
the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short-term borrowing positions in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. the company believes, however, that the on-going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition. in addition, the companys revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. a significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the companys revenues and earnings due to translation of foreign-denominated revenues and expenses. the company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange. from time to time, affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency. the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts.
the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets. the company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts. at december 25, 2016, these contracts had net unrealized gains of $76.5 million, of which $36.7 million are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets, $51.1 million are recorded in other assets and $(11.3) million are recorded in accrued liabilities. included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at december 25, 2016 are deferred gains of $69.3 million, net of tax, related to these derivatives.
at december 25, 2016, the company had fixed rate long-term debt of $1,559.9 million. of this long-term debt, $600.0 million represents the aggregate issuance of long-term debt in may 2014 which consists of $300.0 million of 3.15% notes due 2021 and $300.0 million of 5.10% notes due 2044. prior to the may 2014 debt issuance, the company entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of $500.0 million to hedge the anticipated underlying u.s. treasury interest rate. these interest rate swaps were matched with this debt issuance and were designated and effective as hedges of the change in future interest payments. at the date of issuance, the company terminated these swap agreements and their fair value at the date of issuance was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being amortized through the consolidated statements of operations using an effective interest rate method over the life of the related debt. included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december 25, 2016 are deferred losses, net of tax, of $18.2 million related to these derivatives.
on june 23rd 2016, the united kingdom (uk) voted in a referendum to leave the european union (eu), commonly referred to as brexit. the uk government has stated it will begin the formal two-year period to negotiate the terms of the uks exit and future relationship with the eu by april 2017. the terms of this future relationship are uncertain but the uk government has confirmed its intention to remove the uk from the eu single market and implement additional controls on the movement of people from the eu. the brexit vote resulted in a weakening of british pound sterling against the us dollar and increased volatility in the foreign currency markets, notably the euro. these fluctuations have adversely affected our financial results for 2016, although the impact has been partially mitigated by our hedging strategy. our revenues in europe are predominantly denominated in local currency. hasbro will continue to closely monitor the brexit negotiations and the foreign currency markets, taking appropriate actions to support its long term strategy and to mitigate risks in its operational and financial activities.
the economy and inflation the principal market for the companys products is the retail sector. revenues from the companys top five customers, all retailers, accounted for approximately 41% of its consolidated net revenues in 2016 and 38% and 39% of its consolidated net revenues in 2015 and 2014, respectively. the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate.
48
the companys revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year. in 2016, approximately 66% of the companys full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year. the company expects that this concentration will continue. the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of (a) underproduction of popular items, (b) overproduction of less popular items, and (c) failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules. the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line, product availability, marketing strategies, inventory levels, policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions. larger retailers generally maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season, which includes christmas.
quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in orders increasingly placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders placed well in advance of shipment. retailers are timing their orders so that they are filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers. to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their year-end inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated, their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed, thus negatively impacting the companys future revenues. in addition, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the companys significant retailers could negatively impact the companys future revenues.
the effect of inflation on the companys operations during 2016 was not significant and the company will continue its practice of monitoring costs and adjusting prices, accordingly.
other information the company is not aware of any material amounts of potential exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material to its operating results or financial position.

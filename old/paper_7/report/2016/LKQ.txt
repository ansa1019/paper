item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global distributor of vehicle products, including replacement parts, components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles, specialty vehicle products and accessories, and automotive glass products.
buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources: new products produced by original equipment manufacturers ("oems"); new products produced by companies other than the oems, which are sometimes referred to as aftermarket products; recycled products obtained from salvage vehicles; used products that have been refurbished; and used products that have been remanufactured. we distribute a variety of products to collision and mechanical repair shops, including aftermarket collision and mechanical products, recycled collision and mechanical products, refurbished collision products such as wheels, bumper covers and lights, and remanufactured engines. collectively, we refer to these products as alternative parts because they are not new oem products.
we are the nation's largest provider of alternative vehicle collision replacement products and a leading provider of alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products, with our sales, processing, and distribution facilities reaching most major markets in the united states and canada. we are also a leading provider of alternative vehicle replacement and maintenance products in the united kingdom, the benelux region (belgium, netherlands, and luxembourg), italy, czech republic and switzerland. in addition to our wholesale operations, we operate self service retail facilities across the u.s. that sell recycled automotive products from end-of-life-vehicles. we are also a leading distributor of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories reaching most major markets in the u.s and canada.
on april 21, 2016, we expanded our product offerings to include aftermarket automotive glass products through our acquisition of pgw. with our acquisition of pgw, we are a leading global distributor of automotive glass products reaching most major markets in north america.
we are organized into five operating segments: wholesale - north america; europe; specialty; glass and self service. we aggregate our wholesale -north america, glass and self service operating segments into one reportable segment, north america, resulting in three reportable segments: north america, europe and specialty.
our revenue, cost of goods sold, and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. factors that may affect our operating results include, but are not limited to, those listed in the special note on forward-looking statements in part i, item 1 and risk factors in part i, item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k. due to these factors and others, which may be unknown to us at this time, our operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate. accordingly, our historical results of operations may not be indicative of future performance.
acquisitions and investments since our inception in 1998, we have pursued a growth strategy through both organic growth and acquisitions. we have pursued acquisitions that we believe will help drive profitability, cash flow and stockholder value. we target companies that are market leaders, will expand our geographic presence and enhance our ability to provide a wide array of automotive products to our customers through our distribution network.
on march 18, 2016, lkq acquired rhiag, a distributor of aftermarket spare parts for passenger cars and commercial vehicles in italy, czech republic, switzerland, hungary, romania, ukraine, bulgaria, slovakia, poland and spain. this acquisition expanded lkq's geographic presence in continental europe, and we believe the acquisition will generate potential purchasing synergies.
on april 21, 2016, lkq acquired pgw, a leading global distributor and manufacturer of automotive glass products. pgw's business comprises wholesale and retail distribution services, automotive glass manufacturing, and retailer alliance partnerships. we have signed an agreement to divest the automotive glass manufacturing component of pgw, which we expect to close in the first quarter of 2017. unless otherwise noted, the discussion related to pgw throughout part ii, item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k refers to the aftermarket glass distribution operations of pgw, which are included within continuing operations. see note 3, "discontinued operations" in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information related to our discontinued operations. the acquisition of pgw's aftermarket glass distribution business expanded our addressable market in north america. additionally, we believe the acquisition will create potential distribution synergies with our existing network.
in addition to our acquisitions of rhiag and pgw, we acquired eight wholesale businesses in europe, and five wholesale businesses in north america during the year ended december 31, 2016.
29
on december 1, 2016, we acquired a 26.5% equity interest in mekonomen ab ("mekonomen"), the leading independent car parts and service chain in the nordic region of europe, offering a wide range of quality products including spare parts and accessories for cars, and workshop services for consumers and businesses. we are accounting for our interest in mekonomen using the equity method of accounting, as our investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we completed 18 acquisitions, including 4 wholesale businesses in north america and 12 wholesale businesses in europe, a self service retail operation, and a specialty vehicle aftermarket business. our wholesale business acquisitions in north america included partschannel, inc. ("parts channel"), an aftermarket collision parts distributor. the specialty aftermarket business acquired was the coast distribution system, inc. ("coast"), a supplier of replacement parts, supplies and accessories for the recreational vehicle ("rv") and outdoor recreation markets. our european acquisitions included 11 aftermarket parts distribution businesses in the netherlands, 9 of which were former customers of and distributors for our netherlands subsidiary, sator, and were acquired with the objective of expanding our distribution network in the netherlands. our other acquisitions completed in 2015 enabled us to expand our geographic presence.
on january 3, 2014, we completed our acquisition of keystone specialty. keystone specialty is a leading distributor and marketer of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories in north america serving the following six product segments: truck and off-road; speed and performance; recreational vehicle; towing; wheels, tires and performance handling; and miscellaneous accessories. our acquisition of keystone specialty allowed us to enter into new product lines and increase the size of our addressable market. in addition, the acquisition created logistics and administrative cost synergies and cross-selling opportunities.
in addition to our acquisition of keystone specialty, we made 22 acquisitions during 2014, including 9 wholesale businesses in north america, 9 wholesale businesses in europe, 2 self service retail operations, and 2 specialty vehicle aftermarket businesses. our european acquisitions included 7 aftermarket parts distribution businesses in the netherlands, 5 of which were customers of and distributors for our netherlands subsidiary, sator. our acquisitions in the netherlands enabled us to transform the existing distribution model to better align with that of our u.k. operations. this realignment has allowed us to sell directly to the end repair shop customer instead of through a local wholesale distributor, and to improve margins, customer service, and fulfillment rates, and positioned us well to introduce additional product categories in the long term. our other acquisitions completed during the year ended december 31, 2014 enabled us to expand into new product lines and enter new markets.
sources of revenue we report our revenue in two categories: (i) parts and services and (ii) other. our parts revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle products and related services including (i) aftermarket, other new and refurbished products and (ii) recycled, remanufactured and related products and services. our service revenue is generated primarily from the sale of extended warranties, fees for admission to our self service yards, and processing fees related to the secure disposal of vehicles. for the year ended december 31, 2016, parts and services revenue represented approximately 95% of our consolidated revenue.
the majority of our parts and services revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle replacement products to collision and mechanical repair shops. in north america, our vehicle replacement products include sheet metal crash parts such as doors, hoods, and fenders; bumper covers; head and tail lamps; automotive glass products such as windshields; mirrors and grills; wheels; and large mechanical items such as engines and transmissions. in europe, our products include a wide variety of small mechanical products such as filters, belts and hoses, spark plugs, alternators and water pumps, batteries, suspension and brake parts, clutches, and oil and lubricants. the demand for these products is influenced by several factors, including the number of vehicles in operation, the number of miles being driven, the frequency and severity of vehicle accidents, the age profile of vehicles in accidents, seasonal weather patterns and local weather conditions, and the availability and pricing of new oem parts. with respect to collision related products, automobile insurers exert significant influence over collision repair shops as to how an insured vehicle is repaired and the cost level of the products used in the repair process. accordingly, we consider automobile insurers to be key demand drivers of our vehicle replacement products. while they are not our direct customers, we do provide insurance carriers services in an effort to promote the increased usage of alternative replacement products in the repair process. such services include the review of vehicle repair order estimates, direct quotation services to insurance company adjusters and an aftermarket parts quality and service assurance program. we neither charge a fee to the insurance carriers for these services nor adjust our pricing of products for our customers when we perform these services for insurance carriers. there is no standard price for many of our vehicle replacement products, but rather a pricing structure that varies from day to day based upon such factors as new oem product prices, product availability, quality, demand, the age and mileage of the vehicle from which the part was obtained (in the case of recycled products), competitor pricing and our product cost.
our revenue from aftermarket, other new and refurbished products also includes revenue generated from the sale of specialty aftermarket vehicle equipment and accessories. these products are primarily sold to a large customer base of specialty
30
vehicle retailers and equipment installers, including mostly independent, single-site operators. specialty vehicle aftermarket products are typically installed on vehicles within the first year of ownership to enhance functionality, performance or aesthetics. as a result, the demand for these products is influenced by new and used vehicle sales and the overall economic health of vehicle owners, which may be affected by general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. the prices for our specialty vehicle products are based on manufacturers' suggested retail prices, with discounts applied based on prevailing market conditions, customer volumes and promotions that we may offer from time to time.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, revenue from other sources represented approximately 5% of our consolidated sales. these other sources include scrap sales, bulk sales to mechanical manufacturers (including cores) and sales of aluminum ingots and sows from our furnace operations. we derive scrap metal from several sources, including vehicles that have been used in both our wholesale and self service recycling operations and from oems and other entities that contract with us for secure disposal of "crush only" vehicles. other revenue will vary from period to period based on fluctuations in commodity prices and the volume of materials sold.
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold for aftermarket products includes the price we pay for the parts, freight, and overhead costs related to the purchasing, warehousing and distribution of our inventory, including labor, facility and equipment costs and depreciation. our aftermarket products are acquired from a number of vendors. our cost of goods sold for refurbished products includes the price we pay for cores, freight, and costs to refurbish the parts, including direct and indirect labor, facility and equipment costs, depreciation and other overhead related to our refurbishing operations.
our cost of goods sold for recycled products includes the price we pay for the salvage vehicle and, where applicable, auction, towing and storage fees. prices for salvage vehicles may be impacted by a variety of factors, including the number of buyers competing to purchase the vehicles, the demand and pricing trends for used vehicles, the number of vehicles designated as "total losses" by insurance companies, the production level of new vehicles (which provides the source from which salvage vehicles ultimately come), the age of vehicles at auction and the status of laws regulating bidders or exporters of salvage vehicles. from time to time, we may also adjust our buying strategy to target vehicles with different attributes (for example, age, level of damage, and revenue potential). due to changes relating to these factors, we have seen the prices we pay for salvage vehicles fluctuate over time. our cost of goods sold also includes labor and other costs we incur to acquire and dismantle such vehicles. our labor and labor-related costs related to acquisition and dismantling generally account for between 9% and 13% of our cost of goods sold for vehicles we dismantle. the acquisition and dismantling of salvage vehicles is a manual process and, as a result, energy costs are not material.
our cost of goods sold for remanufactured products includes the price we pay for cores; freight; and costs to remanufacture the products, including direct and indirect labor, facility and equipment costs, depreciation and other overhead related to our remanufacturing operations.
some of our salvage mechanical products are sold with a standard six-month warranty against defects. additionally, some of our remanufactured engines are sold with a standard three-year warranty against defects. we also provide a limited lifetime warranty for certain of our aftermarket products that is supported by certain of the suppliers of those products. we record the estimated warranty costs at the time of sale using historical warranty claims information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses.
other revenue is primarily generated from the hulks and unusable parts of the vehicles we acquire for our wholesale and self service recycled product operations, and therefore, the costs of these sales include the proportionate share of the price we pay for the salvage vehicles as well as the applicable auction, storage and towing fees and internal costs to purchase and dismantle the vehicles. our cost of goods sold for other revenue will fluctuate based on the prices paid for salvage vehicles, which may be impacted by a variety of factors as discussed above.
expenses our facility and warehouse expenses primarily include our costs to operate our aftermarket warehouses, salvage yards and self service retail facilities. these costs include personnel expenses such as wages, incentive compensation and employee benefits for plant management and facility and warehouse personnel, as well as rent for our facilities and related utilities, property taxes, repairs and maintenance. the costs included in facility and warehouse expenses do not relate to inventory processing or conversion activities and, as such, are classified below the gross margin line on our consolidated statements of income.
our distribution expenses primarily include our costs to prepare and deliver our products to our customers. included in our distribution expense category are personnel costs such as wages, employee benefits and incentive compensation for drivers;
31
third party freight costs; fuel; and expenses related to our delivery and transfer trucks, including vehicle leases, repairs and maintenance, and insurance.
our selling and marketing expenses primarily include salary, commission and other incentive compensation expenses for sales personnel; advertising, promotion and marketing costs; credit card fees; telephone and other communication expenses; and bad debt expense. personnel costs generally account for between 75% and 80% of our selling and marketing expenses. most of our sales personnel are paid on a commission basis. the number and quality of our sales force is critical to our ability to respond to our customers' needs and increase our sales volume. our objective is to continually evaluate our sales force, develop and implement training programs, and utilize appropriate measurements to assess our selling effectiveness.
our general and administrative expenses primarily include the costs of our corporate offices and field support center, which provide management, treasury, accounting, legal, payroll, business development, human resources and information systems functions. general and administrative expenses include wages, benefits, stock-based compensation and other incentive compensation for corporate, regional and administrative personnel; information systems support and maintenance expenses; and accounting, legal and other professional fees.
seasonality our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors, influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns. during the winter months, we tend to have higher demand for our vehicle replacement products because there are more weather related repairs. our specialty vehicle operations typically generate greater revenue and earnings in the first half of the year, when vehicle owners tend to install this equipment. we expect our aftermarket glass operations to generate greater revenue and earnings in the second and third quarters, when the demand for glass replacements increases after the winter weather.
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, assumptions, and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, business combinations and goodwill impairment. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and our recognition of revenue. actual results may differ from these estimates.
revenue recognition we recognize and report revenue from the sale of vehicle products when they are shipped to or picked up by the customers and title has transferred, subject to an allowance for estimated returns, discounts and allowances that management estimates based upon historical information. in instances where a product is returned by a customer, the product would ordinarily be returned within a few days of shipment. our customers may earn discounts based upon sales volumes or sales volumes coupled with prompt payment. allowances are normally given within a few days following product shipment. we analyze historical returns and allowances activity by comparing the items to the original invoice amounts and dates. we use this information to project future returns and allowances on products sold. if actual returns and allowances are higher than our historical experience, there would be an adverse impact on our operating results in the period of occurrence.
we recognize revenue from the sale of scrap metal, other metals, and cores when title has transferred, which typically occurs upon delivery to the customer.
inventory accounting salvage and remanufactured inventory. our salvage inventory cost is established based upon the price we pay for a vehicle, including auction, towing and storage fees, as well as expenditures for buying and dismantling vehicles. inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to sales percentage at each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the facility's inventory at expected selling prices, the assessment of which incorporates the sales probability based on a part's days in stock and historical demand. the average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facility's historical profitability for salvage vehicles. remanufactured inventory cost is based upon the price paid for cores, and also includes expenses incurred for freight, direct manufacturing costs and overhead related to our remanufacturing operations.
32
for all inventory, carrying value is recorded at the lower of cost or market and is reduced to reflect current anticipated demand. if actual demand differs from our estimates, additional reductions to inventory carrying value would be necessary in the period such determination is made.
business combinations we record our acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting, under which the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values. we utilize management estimates and, in some instances, independent third-party valuation firms to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and contingent consideration granted. such estimates and valuations require us to make significant assumptions, including projections of future events and operating performance.
goodwill impairment we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at least annually. when testing goodwill for impairment, we are required to evaluate events and circumstances that may affect the performance of the reporting unit and the extent to which the events and circumstances may impact the future cash flows of the reporting unit to determine whether the fair value of the assets exceed the carrying value. if these assumptions or estimates change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets. in response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill.
we perform goodwill impairment tests annually in the fourth quarter and between annual tests whenever events indicate that an impairment may exist. during 2016, we did not identify any events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts. therefore, we did not perform any impairment tests other than our annual test in the fourth quarter of 2016. as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test, we were organized into five operating segments: wholesale - north america; europe; specialty; glass; and self service. our glass operating segment was composed of two reporting units, the aftermarket business and the glass manufacturing business; however, goodwill was recorded only in the aftermarket reporting unit. the other four operating segments were single reporting units for purposes of goodwill testing in 2016.
our goodwill would be considered impaired if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. the fair value estimates are established using weightings of the results of a discounted cash flow methodology and a comparative market multiples approach. we believe that using two methods to determine fair value limits the chances of an unrepresentative valuation. as of december 31, 2016, we had a total of $3.1 billion in goodwill subject to future impairment tests. we determined that no adjustments were necessary when we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2016 on all five reporting units. we noted that the proximity of the pgw acquisition to the goodwill testing date resulted in a fair value estimate for the glass aftermarket reporting unit which exceeded the carrying value by less than 10%. this result aligns with our expectations as there has not been a significant change in the value of the business since the acquisition date while we continue to execute our integration plans. no other reporting unit had a fair value estimate which exceeded the carrying value by less than 25%. if we were required to recognize goodwill impairments, we would report those impairment losses as part of our operating results.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
the change in parts and services revenue of 21.3% represents increases in segment revenue of 9.9% in north america, 46.4% in europe and 13.5% in specialty. the decrease in other revenue of 8.2% primarily consisted of a $53.4 million organic decline partially offset by $15.0 million of acquisition related growth. refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to revenue change during 2016 compared to the prior year.
cost of goods sold. our cost of goods sold increased to 61.0% of revenue in 2016 from 60.6% of revenue in 2015. the increase in cost of goods sold reflects a negative effect of 0.6% from our rhiag acquisition, which has lower gross margins than our prior year consolidated gross margin. in addition, our cost of goods sold increased 0.2% as a result of mix, as we generated a greater proportion of our revenue in our specialty operations, which has lower gross margins than our prior year consolidated gross margin. these negative impacts were partially offset by lower cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue of 0.5% primarily related to our self service and wholesale operations in our north america segment. refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the changes in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue by segment for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the prior year.
facility and warehouse expenses. as a percentage of revenue, facility and warehouse expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016 increased to 8.0% from 7.7% in the prior year. the change in facility and warehouse expense reflects (i) a
34
0.3% increase as a percentage of revenue in our north america operations related to a realignment of plant manager responsibilities, which shifted these expenses from selling, general and administrative expenses to facility and warehouse expenses and (ii) a 0.2% increase as a percentage of revenue in our europe operations for branch openings and the addition of facility costs for the partly operational tamworth, england distribution center. these negative impacts were partially offset by a decrease of 0.3% from our acquisition of rhiag, which has lower facility and warehouse expenses as a percentage of revenue than our prior year consolidated facility and warehouse expenses.
distribution expenses. as a percentage of revenue, distribution expenses decreased to 8.0% in 2016 from 8.4% in 2015. the decrease in distribution expense reflects a positive impact of 0.4% from our rhiag acquisition, which has lower distribution expenses as a percentage of revenue than our prior year consolidated distribution expenses.
selling, general and administrative expenses. our selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016 remained flat compared to the prior year at 11.5% of revenue. sg&a increased 0.2% as a result of our rhiag acquisition, which has higher sg&a than our prior year consolidated sg&a. offsetting this increase was a 0.2% favorable impact from our specialty operations as a result of a decline in personnel costs from the realization of integration synergies, a decrease in bad debt expense and other individually insignificant decreases across various sg&a categories. within our north america segment, sg&a personnel expenses were flat as a percentage of revenue, as the decrease in expense as a percentage of revenue related to the realignment of plant manager responsibilities discussed above was offset by increases in other personnel expenses as a percentage of revenue.

(1)   restructuring expenses of $10.4 million, $3.1 million, $2.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 related to the integration of acquired businesses in our specialty, north america and europe segments, respectively. restructuring expenses of $10.5 million, $2.0 million, and $0.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 were primarily related to the integration of acquired businesses in our specialty, north america, and europe segments, respectively. these integration activities included the closure of duplicate facilities and termination of employees in connection with the integration of our acquisitions into our existing business.
(2)   acquisition related expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016 reflect $10.9 million and $4.1 million related to the acquisitions of rhiag and pgw, respectively. the remaining $7.0 million of expense was related to other completed and potential acquisitions.
(3)   acquisition related expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015 included $1.6 million for our acquisitions of eleven aftermarket parts distribution businesses in the netherlands, $0.2 million for other european acquisitions, and $1.0 million related to our north america and specialty acquisitions during the year. acquisition related expenses also included $3.6 million for acquisitions that were pending as of december 31, 2015.

depreciation and amortization. the following table summarizes depreciation and amortization for the periods indicated (in thousands):
year ended december 31,
2016                                                      2015                              change depreciation                             $107,945                   $88,335           $19,610        (1)
amortization                               83,488                    33,785            49,703        (2)
total depreciation and amortization      $191,433                  $122,120           $69,313
(1)   the increase in depreciation expense primarily reflects the depreciation expense for property and equipment related to our acquisitions of rhiag and pgw of $14.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively. the remaining change primarily reflects increased levels of property and equipment to support our organic related growth.
35
(2)   the increase in amortization expense primarily reflects amortization expense for intangible assets related to our acquisitions of rhiag and pgw of $42.7 million and $8.4 million, respectively. these increases are partially offset by a decline in accelerated amortization for intangibles recognized in previous years.
other expense, net. the following table summarizes the components of the year-over-year increase in other expense, net (in thousands):
other expense, net for the year ended december 31, 2015         $55,597
increase (decrease) due to:
interest expense                                                 30,403       (1)
loss on debt extinguishment                                      26,650       (2)
gains on foreign exchange contracts - acquisition related       (18,342   )   (3)
gain on bargain purchase                                         (8,207   )   (4)
interest and other income, net                                       16
net increase                                                     30,520
other expense, net for the year ended december 31, 2016         $86,117
(1)   additional interest primarily relates to borrowings used to fund the acquisitions of rhiag and pgw.
(2)   during the first quarter of 2016, we incurred a $23.8 million loss on debt extinguishment as a result of our early payment of rhiag debt assumed as part of the acquisition, and we incurred a $2.9 million loss on debt extinguishment as a result of our january 2016 amendment to our senior secured credit agreement.
(3)   in march 2016, we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to acquire a total of €588 million used to fund the purchase price of the rhiag acquisition. the rates under the foreign currency forwards were favorable to the spot rate on the date the funds were drawn to complete the acquisition, and as result, these derivatives contracts generated a gain of $18.3 million.
(4)   in october 2016, we acquired andrew page limited ("andrew page") out of receivership. the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the purchase price, resulting in a gain on bargain purchase of $8.2 million.
provision for income taxes. our effective income tax rate was 32.6% for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to 33.9% for the year ended december 31, 2015. the lower effective income tax rate reflects an $11.4 million discrete item in 2016 for excess tax benefits from stock-based payments related to the early adoption of asu 2016-09 as described in note 4, "summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. the adoption of this asu reduced the effective tax rate by 1.6% compared to the prior year. partially offsetting this, our effective tax rate was negatively impacted by an increase in the proportion of earnings generated in the u.s., which has a higher tax rate than our foreign operations, as well as an increase in nondeductible acquisition related costs, primarily related to our rhiag and pgw acquisitions as well as other potential acquisitions. excluding the impact of discrete items, our annual effective tax rate has been close to 35% over the last three years. the tax rate will fluctuate from year to year based on the geographic mix of earnings and changes in tax laws, but absent significant movements in either of these factors, we expect our annual effective rate to hold near 35%.
equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated subsidiaries. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $2.0 million related to our equity method investments; no tax benefit was recognized related to these charges. our share of net operating losses in our equity method investments totaled $4.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. with our divestiture of acm parts in february 2016, our share of net operating losses in our equity method investments was nominal for the year ended december 31, 2016. we are reporting our equity in earnings of our investment in mekonomen on a one quarter lag and therefore, no amounts were recorded for this investment during 2016.
foreign currency impact. we translate our statements of income at the average exchange rates in effect for the period. relative to the average rates used in 2015, the pound sterling and canadian dollar rates used to translate the 2016 statements of income declined by 11.3% and 3.5%, respectively; the euro remained flat relative to the u.s dollar during 2016. the translation effect of the decline in the pound sterling and canadian dollar against the u.s. dollar and realized and unrealized currency losses during 2016 resulted in an approximately $0.05 negative effect on diluted earnings per share for continuing operations relative to the prior year.
income from discontinued operations, net of tax. income from discontinued operations, net of tax totaled $7.9 million in 2016; we had no discontinued operations in the prior year. discontinued operations for 2016 represents the glass manufacturing business of pgw, which was acquired in april 2016. the results include a $19.8 million, net of tax, impairment charge primarily related to property, plant and equipment that was triggered when the assets were classified as held for sale.

revenue. the following table summarizes the changes in revenue by category (amounts in thousands):
year ended december 31,                                                                            percentage change in revenue
2015                                                                            2014                 organic             acquisition              foreign exchange              total change parts &amp; services revenue      $6,713,951                      $6,086,759                     7.0       %             7.1       %               (3.8         )%             10.3        %
other revenue                        478,682                         653,305                   (28.6      )%             2.2       %               (0.3         )%            (26.7       )%
total revenue                     $7,192,633                      $6,740,064                     3.5       %             6.6       %               (3.4         )%              6.7        %
note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
the change in parts and services revenue of 10.3% represents increases of 6.8% in north america, 8.0% in europe, and 30.6% in specialty. the decline in other revenue of 26.7% primarily reflects the decline in the price of scrap steel and other metals. refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to revenue changes during 2015 compared to the prior year.
cost of goods sold. our cost of goods sold decreased to 60.6% of revenue for the year ended december 31, 2015 from 60.7% of revenue in the prior year. the decrease is related to (i) a decline of 0.3% in costs of goods sold in our european operations, as a result of a 0.2% decrease in our u.k. operations due to lower product costs and 0.1% due to internalizing gross margin from our may 2014 acquisitions of seven netherlands distributors, and (ii) improved net pricing to customers in our north american operations; as our purchase costs were flat on average, the increase in revenue from favorable pricing resulted in a decrease of 0.2% in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue. these decreases were offset by (i) an increase of 0.2% in our specialty operations due to higher inventory costs and unfavorable net customer pricing, and (ii) a negative mix effect of 0.3% primarily resulting from growth of our specialty segment from our october 2014 acquisition of a supplier of parts for recreational vehicles, as this business yields lower gross margins than our north american and european segments. refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the change in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue by segment for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the prior year.
facility and warehouse expenses. as a percentage of revenue, facility and warehouse expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015 decreased to 7.7% from 7.8% in the prior year. compared to the prior year, we experienced a negative impact on operating leverage due to a decrease in other revenue, primarily as a result of declining prices of scrap steel and other metals. excluding the impact of the decline in scrap and other metal prices of 0.1%, facility and warehouse expenses would have improved by 0.2% primarily reflecting a positive mix effect as a greater proportion of revenue was generated from our specialty segment. compared to our north american operations, specialty stores a greater portion of inventory at their regional distribution centers, the costs of which are capitalized into inventory and expensed through cost of goods sold. in our north american wholesale operations, most of the inventory sold by our local operations is stored on site rather than in distribution centers, and the related facility and warehouse expenses of the local operations are recorded in this line item.
distribution expenses. as a percentage of revenue, distribution expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015 decreased to 8.4% from 8.6% in the prior year. distribution expenses decreased by 0.4% compared to the prior year due to fuel cost savings driven by lower average prices. the decline in other revenue caused a 0.2% loss in operating leverage due to the revenue mix shift (scrap and other metals revenue has lower distribution costs than parts sales).
selling, general and administrative expenses. as a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015 increased to 11.5% from 11.3% in the prior year. compared to the prior year, other revenue decreased as a result of declining prices of scrap steel and other metals, which negatively impacted our operating leverage and increased our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue by 0.2%. excluding this impact, our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were flat over the prior year.

37
(2)   restructuring expense for the year ended december 31, 2014 included $5.8 million of expense related to the integration of our keystone specialty acquisition, as well as $1.9 million, $1.0 million, and $0.8 million of expense related to the integration of acquired businesses in our european, north american and specialty segments, respectively. additionally, we incurred $1.6 million of severance costs to terminated employees as part of the ongoing rationalization of our european operations.
(3)   refer to our year ended december 31, 2016 compared to year ended december 31, 2015 discussion for details.

depreciation and amortization. the following table summarizes depreciation and amortization for the periods indicated (in thousands):
year ended december 31,
2015                                                      2014                              change depreciation                              $88,335                   $86,216            $2,119        (1)
amortization                               33,785                    34,503              (718    )   (2)
total depreciation and amortization      $122,120                  $120,719            $1,401
(1)   the increase in depreciation expense was a result of increased levels of property and equipment to support our acquisition and organic related growth, partially offset by a decline of $3.1 million attributable to the impact of foreign exchange rates.
(2)   the decrease in amortization expense reflects a $1.6 million decline due to foreign exchange rates partially offset by net increases in amortization expense for intangibles recorded related to our 2014 and 2015 acquisitions. the amortization expense for the year ended december 31, 2014 included accelerated amortization for intangibles recognized during 2014 for the january 2014 acquisition of keystone specialty.
other expense, net. the following table summarizes the components of the year-over-year decrease in other expense, net (in thousands):
other expense, net for the year ended december 31, 2014       $61,980
increase (decrease) due to:
interest expense                                               (6,682   )   (1)
loss on debt extinguishment                                      (324   )   (2)
interest and other income, net                                    623       (3)
total decrease                                                 (6,383   )
other expense, net for the year ended december 31, 2015       $55,597
(1)   approximately $4.2 million of the reduction in interest expense from the prior year is due to lower outstanding borrowings. the remaining $2.5 million is attributable to lower interest rates under our senior secured credit agreement. the higher outstanding debt levels in the prior year were primarily related to borrowings used to finance the keystone specialty acquisition in january 2014 and cash flow from operations in 2015 that was used to pay down debt.
(2)   during the year ended december 31, 2014, we incurred a $0.3 million loss on debt extinguishment as a result of our march 2014 amendment to our senior secured credit agreement. we did not incur a similar charge during 2015.
(3)   the decrease in interest and other income, net reflects an increase in contingent consideration expense relative to the prior year of $2.3 million partially offset by (i) an increase in customer finance fees of $1.3 million and (ii) a favorable impact due to a decrease in foreign currency losses of $0.5 million, including the impact of unrealized mark-to-market losses on foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge the purchase of inventory and, to a lesser extent, unrealized and realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the prior year.
38
provision for income taxes. our effective income tax rate was 33.9% for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to 34.7% for the year ended december 31, 2014. the lower effective tax rate in 2015 reflects a 0.5% benefit relative to the prior year as a result of an increase in earnings in our lower tax rate international operations. in addition, the effective tax rate for 2015 benefited from discrete items, including favorable return to provision adjustments of $1.9 million and the favorable settlement of a canada tax matter totaling $1.8 million.
equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated subsidiaries. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $2.0 million in our equity method investments. no tax benefit was recognized related to these charges. our share of net operating losses in our equity method investments totaled $4.1 million through the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $2.1 million during the prior year.
foreign currency impact. we translate our statements of income at the average exchange rates in effect for the period. relative to the average rates used in 2014, the pound sterling, euro and canadian dollar rates used to translate the 2015 statements of income declined by 7.2%, 16.4%, and 13.5%, respectively. the translation effect of the decline of these currencies against the u.s. dollar and realized and unrealized currency losses for the year resulted in an approximately $0.04 negative effect on diluted earnings per share relative to the prior year.
results of operations-segment reporting we have five operating segments: wholesale - north america; europe; specialty; glass and self service. our wholesale - north america, glass and self service operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment, north america, because they possess similar economic characteristics and have common products and services, customers, and methods of distribution. therefore, we present three reportable segments: north america, europe and specialty.
subsequent to the sale of our glass manufacturing business, we are combining our continuing glass aftermarket products operating segment into our wholesale - north america operating segment, which we expect to complete in 2017.
we have presented the growth of our revenue and profitability in our operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis. the constant currency presentation, which is a non-gaap measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. we believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our growth and profitability, consistent with how we evaluate our performance, as this statistic removes the translation impact of exchange rate fluctuations, which are outside of our control and do not reflect our operational performance. constant currency revenue and segment ebitda results are calculated by translating prior year revenue and segment ebitda in local currency using the current year's currency conversion rate. this non-gaap financial measure has important limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap. our use of this term may vary from the use of similarly-titled measures by other issuers due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation. in addition, not all companies that report revenue or profitability on a constant currency basis calculate such measures in the same manner as we do and, accordingly, our calculations are not necessarily comparable to similarly-named measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for performance relative to other companies.

the key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our chief operating decision maker, who is our chief executive officer, is segment ebitda. segment ebitda includes revenue and expenses that are controllable by the segment. corporate and administrative expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage, with shared expenses apportioned based on the segment's percentage of consolidated revenue. we calculate segment ebitda as ebitda excluding restructuring and acquisition related expenses, change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, other acquisition related gains and losses and equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated subsidiaries. ebitda, which is the basis for segment ebitda, is calculated as net income excluding discontinued operations, depreciation, amortization, interest (including loss on debt extinguishment) and income tax expense. see note 14, "segment and geographic information" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for a reconciliation of total segment ebitda to net income.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   organic growth in parts and services revenue was primarily attributable to favorable pricing. increased pricing in our wholesale operations, primarily in our salvage operations, was a result of shifting our salvage vehicle purchasing to higher quality vehicles, which raised the average revenue per part sold. organic revenue also grew due to increased sales volumes in our wholesale operations resulting from improved fill rates and in-stock rates, as well as increased purchasing levels, which contributed to a greater volume of parts available for sale. the organic growth was partially offset by a negative mix impact as we saw a smaller percentage of sales from high value salvage part types in 2016.
40
organic revenue growth in parts and services was also negatively affected by milder winter weather conditions in north america in the first quarter of 2016, which we believe impacted volume for the rest of the year.
(2)   the $40 million decrease in other revenue primarily relates to (i) a $21 million decline in revenue from metals, such as those found in catalytic converters (platinum, palladium, and rhodium), aluminum wheels, and copper wiring, due to lower prices year over year, (ii) a $13 million reduction due to the sale of our precious metals business late in the second quarter of 2015, and (iii) an $8 million decline in revenue from scrap steel and other metals primarily related to lower prices.
(3)   acquisition related growth in 2016 includes $208.6 million from our acquisition of pgw. the remainder of our acquired revenue growth reflects revenue from our acquisition of nine wholesale businesses and a self service retail operation from the beginning of 2015 up to the one year anniversary of the acquisition dates.
(4)   compared to the prior year, exchange rates reduced our revenue growth by 0.2%, primarily due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the canadian dollar compared to the prior year.
segment ebitda. segment ebitda increased $48.9 million, or 8.9%, in 2016 compared to the prior year. while other revenue decreased from the prior year, sequential increases in scrap steel prices in our salvage and self service operations benefited gross margins and had a favorable impact of $7.7 million on north america segment ebitda and approximately a $0.02 positive effect on diluted earnings per share. this favorable impact resulted from the increase in scrap steel prices between the date we purchased the car, which influences the price we pay for the car, and the date we scrapped the car, which influences the price we receive for scrapping the vehicle.

increase (decrease) due to:

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   the improvement in gross margin reflects a 0.8% favorable impact from our self service operations, as car costs have decreased by a greater percentage year over year than revenue. within our wholesale operations, we experienced a 0.5% favorable impact on gross margin as a result of procurement initiatives implemented in our aftermarket operations during 2016, which reduced our product costs. partially offsetting these increases was an unfavorable impact of 0.4% related to our acquisition of pgw, which had lower gross margins than our existing north america operations as a result of a non-recurring inventory step-up adjustment recorded upon acquisition and higher cost products sourced from the glass manufacturing side of the business.
(2)   the increase in segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue reflects (i) an increase in operating expenses of 0.3% related to our pgw acquisition, which had higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenue than our existing north america operations as a result of incremental costs related to shared glass corporate expenses that are not expected to reoccur after the sale of the pgw glass manufacturing business closes, and (ii) a 0.3% increase in personnel costs as a percentage of revenue. these increases were partially offset by a 0.2% improvement in fuel prices as a percentage of revenue.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   in our u.k. operations, parts and services revenue grew organically by 8.1%, while in benelux region operations, parts and services revenue grew organically by 4.5%. our organic revenue growth in the u.k., which resulted from higher sales volumes, was composed of a 6.6% increase in revenue from stores open more than 12 months and a 1.5% increase in revenue generated by 21 branch openings since the beginning of the prior year through the one-year anniversary of their respective opening dates. organic revenue growth in our benelux region was primarily due to a favorable mix impact resulting from a shift in sales to higher price products as well as increased prices; organic revenue also grew as a result of an additional selling day in 2016 compared to the prior year.
(2)   acquisition related growth for the year-ended december 31, 2016 includes $847.5 million from our acquisition of rhiag. the remainder of our acquired revenue growth includes revenue from our acquisitions of 14 distribution companies in the netherlands, 3 wholesale businesses in our u.k. operations, and 3 salvage businesses in sweden since the beginning of 2015 through the one-year anniversary of the acquisitions.
(3)   compared to the prior year, exchange rates reduced our revenue growth by $158.2 million, or 7.9%, primarily due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the pound sterling relative to 2015.
segment ebitda. segment ebitda increased $83.0 million, or 41.4%, in 2016 compared to the prior year. our rhiag acquisition contributed $94.3 million to segment ebitda in 2016, while our andrew page acquisition generated a loss of $4.8 million. our europe segment ebitda includes a negative year over year impact of $17.6 million related to the translation of local currency results into u.s. dollars at lower exchange rates than those experienced during 2015. on a constant currency basis (i.e. excluding the translation impact), segment ebitda increased by $100.6 million, or 50.2%, compared to the prior year. refer to the foreign currency impact discussion within the results of operations - consolidated section above for further detail regarding foreign currency impact on our results for the year ended december 31, 2016.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   the decrease in gross margin reflects a 1.3% decline in gross margin due to the acquisition of rhiag, which has lower gross margins than our other europe operations.
(2)   the decrease in segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue reflects (i) a decrease of 1.8% in operating expenses as a result of the acquisition of rhiag, which has lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue than our other europe operations and (ii) a 0.3% decrease in distribution expenses in our u.k. operations due to reduced personnel costs. partially offsetting these decreases were (i) an increase in facility and warehouse expenses of 0.8% from a 0.5% increase primarily related to the opening of 21 new branches and 6 new hubs since the prior year and
42
0.3% related to the addition of facility and personnel costs for the tamworth distribution facility, and (ii) an increase of 0.3% in operating expenses as a result of the acquisition of andrew page, which has higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenue than our other europe operations. while we have closed the andrew page acquisition and are consolidating its results, we are not permitted to integrate this acquisition with our existing u.k. operations until we receive approval from the u.k. competition and markets authority.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   organic growth in specialty parts and services revenue reflects an increase in service levels throughout north america as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our inventory offerings and add delivery capacity to our integrated distribution network to allow us to realize synergies associated with the integration of coast. through most of 2016, we also saw growth from favorable macro trends and economic conditions, which increased consumer discretionary spending on automotive and recreational vehicle parts and accessories.
(2)   acquisition related growth reflects the impact of the coast acquisition on august 19, 2015 through the one year anniversary of the acquisition.
(3)   compared to the prior year, exchange rates reduced our revenue growth by $3.3 million, or 0.3%, primarily due to the strengthening of the u.s dollar against the canadian dollar relative to 2015.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   the decline in gross margin reflects (i) a 0.4% unfavorable impact due to customer volume rebates which have increased along with sales volume, (ii) a 0.3% increase in inventory costs, which were higher due to the stocking of two distribution centers, one of which was not yet operational in the prior year period and one which became operational in the fourth quarter of 2015, and (iii) a decrease in advertising credits of 0.3% due to higher purchase volume in 2015 from the initial stocking of those two new distribution centers. these negative effects were partially offset by a 0.4% improvement due to coast related freight synergies as more volume went through the existing specialty network.
(2)   the decrease in segment operating expenses reflects a favorable 1.0% reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily related to (i) a 0.4% decline in personnel costs from the realization of integration synergies, (ii) lower bad debt expense of 0.2% due to increased collection efforts and (iii) individually insignificant decreases across
43
various selling, general and administrative expense categories totaling 0.4%. favorable distribution expenses of 0.2% due to lower fuel and freight costs were offset by an increase in facilities and warehouse expense primarily related to the higher cost of coast facilities as well as the addition of two new distribution centers.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   the acquisition growth in revenue reflects the impact of 13 wholesale businesses and 3 self service retail operations acquired since the beginning of 2014 up to the one year anniversary of the acquisition date
(2)   approximately 60% of our organic growth in parts and services revenue was due to increased net pricing in our wholesale operations. in our aftermarket operations, we increased our net prices to customers compared to the prior year. in our salvage operations, we shifted our salvage vehicle purchasing to higher quality vehicles beginning in the third quarter of 2014, which increased the average revenue per part sold during 2015. the remainder of our organic growth in parts and services revenue was primarily due to increased sales volumes in our salvage operations and to a lesser extent, our aftermarket operations.
(3)   approximately $161 million of the $187 million organic decline in other revenue was a result of lower prices received from the sale of scrap and other metals. this was primarily due to lower prices from the sale of crushed auto bodies, which fluctuate based on steel prices. lower sales volumes were responsible for the remaining decline, primarily due to fewer vehicles processed relative to the prior year.
segment ebitda. segment ebitda increased $3.5 million, or 0.6%, in 2015 compared to the prior year. the decline in scrap steel and other metals prices as described in the revenue section above had a negative year over year impact of $34.4 million on north american segment ebitda and a $0.07 negative effect on diluted earnings per share relative to the prior year.
the following table summarizes the changes in segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue in our north america segment:
north america                                                                        percentage of total segment revenue segment ebitda for the year ended december 31, 2014                                          13.3                      %
increase due to:
change in gross margin                                                                        0.4                      %                    (1)
change in segment operating expenses                                                         (0.5                     )%                    (2)
segment ebitda for the year ended december 31, 2015                                          13.2                      %
note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   the improvement in gross margin reflects a 0.2% favorable impact from our aftermarket product lines and a 0.1% favorable mix impact resulting from more revenue being derived from our wholesale operations, which have higher gross margin percentages relative to our self service operations during periods when scrap and other metal prices decline. in our aftermarket products, we improved our gross margin through increases in net prices to our customers. despite the continued decline in scrap and other metal prices, margins in our self service operations have remained consistent year over year, resulting from the continued effort to reduce car costs and purchase higher quality cars that
44
will yield more parts revenue per vehicle to offset the loss in scrap and other metal revenue.
(2)   the decline in segment ebitda margin related to operating expenses was primarily the result of the negative impact on operating leverage caused by the decrease in other revenue related to the declining prices of scrap steel and other metals. in periods of falling scrap revenue, we do not experience a commensurate decline in operating expenses, as we have few variable costs associated with the sale of scrap and other metals. the 0.5% increase in segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue included an unfavorable impact of 1.1% related to the decline in prices for scrap steel and other metals. this increase was partially offset by an improvement in segment operating expenses of 0.6%, which is primarily the result of a 0.4% improvement in distribution expenses due to a reduction in fuel costs.
europe third party revenue. the following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our european segment (in thousands):
year ended december 31,                                                                                    percentage change in revenue europe                                          2015                            2014             organic (1)             acquisition (2)              foreign exchange (3)              total change parts &amp; services revenue      $1,991,106                      $1,843,730                     9.2       %               8.5         %                 (9.7           )%              8.0        %

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   in our u.k. operations, parts and services revenue grew organically by 11.8%, while in our continental european operations, parts and services revenue grew organically by 2.8%, resulting in net organic revenue growth of 9.2% over the prior year. our organic revenue growth in the u.k., which resulted from higher sales volumes, was composed of a 7.5% increase in revenue from stores open more than 12 months and a 4.3% increase from revenue generated by 54 branch openings since the beginning of the prior year through the one year anniversary of their respective opening dates. organic revenue growth in our continental european operations was primarily due to the opening of a new warehouse location in france in 2014 and, to a lesser extent, growth in our belgian market.
(2)   acquisition related growth for the year-ended december 31, 2015 includes $158.1 million from our acquisitions of 18 distribution companies in the netherlands since the beginning of 2014 and the purchase of a salvage business in sweden through the one year anniversary of the acquisitions.
(3)   compared to the prior year, exchange rates reduced our revenue growth by $179.8 million, or 9.7%, primarily due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against both the pound sterling and euro relative to 2014.
segment ebitda. segment ebitda increased $33.4 million, or 20%, to $200.6 million through the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $167.2 million in the prior year. our european segment ebitda includes a negative year over year impact of $15.7 million related to the translation of local currency results into u.s. dollars at lower exchange rates than those experienced during 2014. on a constant currency basis (i.e. excluding the translation impact), segment ebitda increased by $49.1 million, or 29.4%, compared to the prior year. refer to the foreign currency impact discussion within the results of operations - consolidated section above for further detail regarding foreign currency impact on our results for the year ended december 31, 2015. the following table summarizes the changes in segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue in our european segment:

(1)   the increase in gross margin reflects improvement of 0.7% in our uk operations, primarily as a result of a reduction in product costs and an increase in supplier rebates, and 0.6% in our continental european operations as a result of internalizing incremental gross margin from our 2014 acquisitions of seven netherlands distributors.
(2)   the increase in segment operating expenses reflects higher selling, general and administrative expenses of 0.5%, related to higher personnel costs to support the growth of the business, including our e-commerce business, in the uk and continental europe. distribution costs improved over the prior year period by 0.2% due to internalizing previously outsourced delivery expenses as well as lower fuel costs.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   organic growth in specialty parts and services revenue reflects increased sales volumes as a result of favorable economic conditions.
(2)   acquisition related growth reflects the impact of two specialty businesses acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014, as well as the acquisition of coast on august 19, 2015.
(3)   compared to the prior year, exchange rates reduced our revenue growth by 1.9%, primarily due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the canadian dollar in 2015 compared to the prior year.
segment ebitda. segment ebitda increased $27.1 million, or 34.1%, in 2015 compared to the prior year.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   the decline in gross margin reflects a 0.7% increase in inventory costs, most of which we expect to be temporary as integration plans are completed, and a decrease in gross margin of 0.4% due to unfavorable net customer pricing. our acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2014 of a supplier of parts for recreational vehicles resulted in a 0.4% decline in gross margin compared to the prior year. compared to our existing specialty business, this acquisition realizes lower gross margins than our other specialty product sales. these negative effects on gross margin were partially offset by a favorable mix effect of 0.2% resulting from a shift toward higher margin product lines, particularly truck and off road products.
(2)   reflects a 0.8% reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue related to (i) a 0.6% decline in personnel expenses as a percentage of revenue primarily as a result of integration synergies and (ii) a reduction in professional fees and advertising expenses of 0.2%. distribution expenses decreased 0.7% due to (i) favorable fuel pricing compared to the prior year of 0.6%, (ii) logistics synergies of 0.5% as we leverage our north
46
american distribution network for the delivery of specialty products, partially offset by (iii) higher freight costs of 0.4% driven by higher use of third party freight to handle increased volumes, as well as sales related to our october 2014 acquisition of a supplier of parts for recreational vehicles and our 2015 acquisition of coast, which are all shipped via third party carriers.

total liquidity (cash and equivalents plus availability on credit facilities)       1,246,512               1,425,050
(1) debt amounts reflect the gross values to be repaid (excluding debt issuance costs of $23.9 million and $15.0 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively).
(2) debt amounts reflect the gross values to be repaid (excluding debt issuance costs of $2.3 million and $1.5 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively).
(3) includes our revolving credit facilities, our receivables securitization facility, and letters of credit.
we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to fund our operations and provide for expansion through both internal development and acquisitions. our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and our credit facilities. we utilize our cash flows from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures, with the excess amounts going towards funding acquisitions or paying down outstanding debt. as we have pursued acquisitions as part of our growth strategy, our cash flows from operations have not always been sufficient to cover our investing activities. to fund our acquisitions, we have accessed various forms of debt financing, including revolving credit facilities, senior notes, and a receivables securitization facility.
as of december 31, 2016, we had debt outstanding and additional available sources of financing, as follows:
•   senior secured credit facilities maturing in january 2021, composed of term loans totaling $750 million ($732.7 million outstanding at december 31, 2016) and $2.45 billion in revolving credit ($1.36 billion outstanding at december 31, 2016), bearing interest at variable rates (although a portion of this debt is hedged through interest rate swap contracts) reduced by $72.7 million of amounts outstanding under letters of credit
•   senior notes totaling $600 million, maturing in may 2023 and bearing interest at a 4.75% fixed rate
•   euro notes totaling $526 million (€500 million), maturing in april 2024 and bearing interest at a 3.875% fixed rate
•   receivables securitization facility with availability up to $100 million ($100 million outstanding as of december 31, 2016), maturing in november 2019 and bearing interest at variable commercial paper rates from time to time, we may undertake financing transactions to increase our available liquidity, such as our january 2016 amendment to our senior secured credit facilities, the issuance of €500 million of euro notes in april 2016, and the november 2016 amendment to our receivables securitization facility. the rhiag acquisition was the catalyst for the april issuance of €500 million of euro notes. given that rhiag is a long term asset, we considered alternative financing options and decided to fund a portion of this acquisition through the issuance of long term notes. additionally, the interest rates on rhiag's acquired debt ranged between 6.45% and 7.25%. with the issuance of the €500 million of senior notes at a rate of 3.875%, we were able to replace rhiag's borrowings with long term financing at favorable rates. this refinancing also provides financial flexibility to execute our long-term growth strategy by freeing up availability under our revolver. if we see an attractive acquisition opportunity, we have the ability to use our revolver to move quickly and have certainty of funding.
as of december 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.02 billion available under our credit facilities. combined with approximately $227.4 million of cash and equivalents at december 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.25 billion in available liquidity, a decrease of $178.5 million from our available liquidity as of december 31, 2015. we expect to use the proceeds from the sale of pgw's glass manufacturing business to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, which would increase our available liquidity by approximately $310 million when the transaction closes.
48
we believe that our current liquidity and cash expected to be generated by operating activities in future periods will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements, although such sources may not be sufficient for future acquisitions depending on their size. while we believe that we have adequate capacity, from time to time we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic relationships or other arrangements. there can be no assurance that additional funding, or refinancing of our credit facilities, if needed, will be available on terms attractive to us, or at all. furthermore, any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants or higher interest costs. our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
borrowings under the credit agreement accrue interest at variable rates, which are tied to libor or cdor, depending on the currency and the duration of the borrowing, plus an applicable margin rate which is subject to change quarterly based on our reported leverage ratio. we hold interest rate swaps to hedge the variable rates on a portion of our credit agreement borrowings, with the effect of fixing the interest rates on the respective notional amounts. in addition, in 2016, we entered into cross currency swaps that contain an interest rate swap component and a foreign currency forward contract component that, when combined with related intercompany financing arrangements, effectively convert variable rate u.s. dollar-denominated borrowings into fixed rate euro-denominated borrowings. these derivative transactions are described in note 10, "derivative instruments and hedging activities" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. after giving effect to these contracts, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement at december 31, 2016 was 2.0%. including our senior notes and the borrowings on our receivables securitization program, our overall weighted average interest rate on borrowings was 2.8% at december 31, 2016.
cash interest payments were $86.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, including interest payments totaling $28.5 million related to our senior notes. in september 2016, we made our first semi-annual interest payment on our euro notes totaling €9.0 million ($10.1 million); the remaining semi-annual interest payments on our euro notes will be made in october and april each year. cash interest payments in 2016 also included $8.0 million of interest paid as part of the settlement of rhiag's acquired debt and $4.9 million to settle the acquired rhiag interest rate swap in the first quarter of 2016.
we had outstanding credit agreement borrowings of $2.1 billion and $0.9 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. of these amounts, $37.2 million and $22.5 million were classified as current maturities at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

(1) the total debt amounts presented above reflect the gross values to be repaid (excluding debt issuance costs of $23.9 million as of december 31, 2016).
our credit agreement contains customary covenants that provide limitations and conditions on our ability to enter into certain transactions. the credit agreement also contains financial and affirmative covenants, including limitations on our net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants under our credit agreement as of december 31, 2016.
as of december 31, 2016, the company had cash and equivalents of $227.4 million, of which $175.4 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. we consider the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested, and accordingly no provision for u.s. income taxes has been provided thereon. should these earnings be repatriated in the future, in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to both u.s. income taxes (subject to adjustment for foreign tax credits) and potential withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. we believe that we have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to meet our financial obligations in the u.s. without resorting to repatriation of foreign earnings.

the procurement of inventory is the largest operating use of our funds. we normally pay for aftermarket product purchases at the time of shipment or on standard payment terms, depending on the manufacturer and the negotiated payment terms. we normally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under direct procurement arrangements at the time that we take possession of the vehicles.

(1)   in north america, aftermarket purchases for the year increased primarily as a result of incremental purchases of $140.7 million related to our april 2016 acquisition of pgw. additionally, north america aftermarket inventory purchases increased as a result of our july 2015 acquisition of parts channel coupled with lower purchase levels in the first quarter of 2015 due to accelerated purchases in the fourth quarter of 2014 in anticipation of potential labor issues at west coast ports in the united states.
(2)   in our europe segment, the increase in purchases was primarily due to our acquisition of rhiag in march 2016, which added incremental purchases of $710.3 million during 2016. purchases for our u.k. operations increased in 2016 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of 21 branch openings since the beginning of the prior year and incremental inventory purchases to stock the tamworth, england national distribution center. purchases in our netherlands operations increased as a result of organic and acquisition related growth. these increases were partially offset by the devaluation of the pound sterling in 2016 compared to the prior year.
(3)   the increase in specialty aftermarket purchases was primarily due to (i) accelerated inventory purchases to stock two new distribution centers during the first quarter of 2016, (ii) additional purchases to support the increased sales volume as a result of the coast acquisition, and (iii) additional inventory purchases in 2016 due to stronger than anticipated sales volumes as a result of our annual trade shows.
manufacturing inventory purchases related to our discontinued operations totaled $397.5 million during 2016, and consisted of raw materials used in pgw's manufacturing and fabrication of automotive glass products.

(1)   compared to the prior year period, we increased our purchase of lower cost self service and "crush only" cars as prices for vehicles have come down in certain markets due to the decline in the prices of scrap and other metals, allowing us to purchase higher quality vehicles at favorable prices.
net cash provided by operating activities totaled $635.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, an increase of $90.7 million compared to $544.3 million in 2015. during 2016, our glass manufacturing business, which was acquired in april 2016, generated $64.4 million of cash flows from operations from the acquisition date through year-end. these operating cash flows are expected to be nonrecurring as we plan to close the sale of this business in the first quarter of 2017.
the remaining increase in cash provided by operating activities was attributable to our continuing operations. during 2016, our income from continuing operations increased by $32.9 million compared to the prior year due to both acquisition related growth and organic growth. in addition, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense increased by $70.1 million compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of our rhiag and pgw acquisitions. cash paid for taxes for our continuing
50
operations increased by $37.0 million during 2016 compared to the prior year as a result of growth in the business, primarily related to our rhiag acquisition.
cash outflows for our primary working capital accounts (receivables, inventory and payables) totaled $115.1 million during 2016 compared to $72.7 million during 2015. cash flows related to our primary working capital accounts can be volatile as the purchases, payments and collections can be timed differently from period to period and can be influenced by factors outside of our control. however, we expect that the net change in these working capital items will generally be a cash outflow as we grow our business each year. cash outflows related to receivables were $80.2 million higher in 2016 than the prior year. the increase in accounts receivable is primarily related to our u.k. operations as a result of increased sales; the remaining increase primarily related to our specialty operations, which experienced larger growth in receivables balances during 2016 than the prior year period from organic and acquisition revenue growth. compared to the prior year, cash outflows related to inventory declined $16.6 million, primarily a result of our north america and specialty operations. this was partially offset by inventory growth in our u.k. operations as a result of incremental inventory purchases to stock new branches and the tamworth, england national distribution center. accounts payable represented a $17.0 million cash inflow in 2016 compared to a $4.2 million cash outflow in the prior year. the increase is primarily related to a rise in the payables balance in our u.k. operations, partially offset by a decline in the payables balance in our north america and rhiag operations due to the timing of payments.
net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to $330.0 million in 2015. we invested $1.3 billion of cash, net of cash acquired, in business acquisitions during 2016, which included $601.4 million for our rhiag acquisition and $661.7 million for our pgw acquisition, compared to $160.5 million for business acquisitions in 2015. property and equipment purchases were $207.1 million in the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $170.5 million in the prior year. purchases of property and equipment increased over the prior period primarily as a result of $24.2 million of purchases in our discontinued operations and a $19.6 million increase in our north america segment. in 2016, we paid $185.7 million for investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, primarily related to our investment in mekonomen; payments for investments in consolidated subsidiaries were $9.7 million in 2015. in 2016, we entered into foreign currency contracts to fund the purchase price of the rhiag acquisition, which generated $18.3 million of gains; we had no such contracts in the prior year period. during 2016, cash provided by other investing activities, net was $13.8 million, primarily from the proceeds on the sale of our interest in our australian joint venture, compared to $10.7 million in 2015 primarily as a result of proceeds from disposals of fixed assets.
net cash provided by financing activities totaled $1.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $238.5 million in 2015. during 2016, net borrowings under our credit facilities were $1.3 billion compared to net repayments of $186.5 million in 2015. the increase in borrowings during 2016 is primarily the result of borrowings under our multi-currency revolving credit facility in order to fund the acquisitions of rhiag and pgw and investment in mekonomen and repay $543.3 million of rhiag acquired debt and debt related liabilities. the increase in borrowings during 2016 also reflects our 2016 amendments of our credit facilities, which generated $338.5 million in additional term loan borrowings, a portion of which was used to repay outstanding revolver borrowings. in april 2016, we issued the euro notes, generating proceeds of $563.5 million. the proceeds from the euro notes were used to repay a portion of the borrowings on the revolving credit facility. in connection with our january and december 2016 amendments of our credit facilities, our april 2016 issuance of the euro notes, and our november 2016 amendment to our receivables securitization facility, we paid $16.6 million of debt issuance costs during the 2016; debt issuance costs incurred in the prior year were minimal.
we intend to continue to evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of distribution centers, processing and sales facilities, and warehouses, through further integration of our facilities, and through selected business acquisitions. our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including the costs and timing of our internal development efforts and the success of those efforts, the costs and timing of expansion of our sales and marketing activities, and the costs and timing of future business acquisitions.

(1)   in north america, we accelerated our aftermarket inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of 2014 in anticipation of potential labor issues at west coast ports in the u.s., leading to growth in the year-end inventory balance. as a result, our aftermarket inventory purchases in the first half of 2015 fell below 2014 levels. during the second half of 2015, we increased our aftermarket inventory purchases above the prior year levels as a result of an increase in sales and the depletion of the inventory acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014. our july 2015 acquisition of parts channel also contributed to the increase in purchases in the second half of 2015. for the year ended december 31, 2015, our north american purchases were $38.1 million higher than the prior year.
(2)   in our european segment, our acquisitions of the netherlands distributors in 2014 and 2015 contributed incremental inventory purchases of $49.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. purchases for our u.k. operations increased in 2015 compared to the prior period primarily as a result of opening five new regional distribution centers. however, the greater purchase levels in europe were partially offset by the devaluation of the pound sterling and euro compared to the prior year period.
(3)   the increase in specialty aftermarket inventory purchases of $163.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2015, was related to accelerated inventory purchases to stock two new distribution centers, one of which opened in late 2015 and one of which opened in the first quarter of 2016. our august 2015 acquisition of coast and our october 2014 acquisition of a supplier of parts for recreational vehicles also contributed to the increase in purchases compared to the prior year period.

net cash provided by operating activities totaled $544.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to $388.7 million in 2014. compared to the prior year, our 2015 ebitda increased by $52.9 million, due to both acquisition related growth and organic growth. see note 14, "segment and geographic information" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for a reconciliation of ebitda to net income.
cash outflows for our primary working capital accounts (receivables, inventory and payables) totaled $72.7 million during 2015 compared to $189.8 million during 2014. in 2015, cash outflows for inventory totaled $83.2 million as a result of inventory growth, particularly in our specialty operations; cash outflows for inventory were $122.6 million in the prior year. as discussed above, we increased our north american aftermarket inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of 2014 in anticipation of port issues in the u.s., which resulted in a larger cash outflow in the prior year as compared to 2015. accounts receivable represented a cash inflow of $14.7 million in 2015 compared to a cash outflow of $61.7 million in 2014. in europe, our netherlands operations experienced a reduction in accounts receivable in 2015 as result of a higher rate of collections due to the implementation of an automatic payment program. in the prior year, receivables balances increased primarily as a result of increased sales levels in our u.k. operations. cash flows related to our primary working capital accounts can be volatile as the purchases, payments and collections can be timed differently from period to period and can be influenced by factors outside of our control. however, we expect that the net change in these working capital items will generally be a cash outflow as we grow our business each year.
net cash used in investing activities totaled $330.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to $921.0 million for the same period of 2014.we invested $160.5 million of cash, net of cash acquired, in business acquisitions during
52
2015, compared to $775.9 million for business acquisitions in 2014, which included $427.1 million for our keystone specialty acquisition. property and equipment purchases were $170.5 million in the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $141.0 million in the prior year. the increase in capital expenditures relative to the prior year period reflects an increase of $33.0 million in our u.k. operations primarily due to costs incurred to develop and equip a new distribution center. during 2015, cash provided by other investing activities, net was $10.7 million and primarily consisted of proceeds from disposals of fixed assets totaling $10.7 million, partially offset by payments of $9.7 million for investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, including a $7.5 million payment to increase our investment in acm parts. during 2014, we paid $2.2 million for investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries.
net cash provided by financing activities totaled $238.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to $501.2 million in 2014. during 2015, net repayments under our credit facilities were $186.5 million compared to net borrowings of $578.4 million in 2014. compared to the prior year period, our cash investment in acquisitions was lower, and therefore, we used the excess cash generated by operations to repay outstanding amounts under our revolving credit facilities. during 2014, we used the proceeds from the net borrowings primarily to fund acquisitions, including $370 million of revolver borrowings and $80 million of borrowings under our receivables facility to finance the keystone specialty acquisition. our march 2014 amendment of our credit facilities generated $11.3 million in additional term loan borrowings, which were used to pay $3.7 million in debt issuance costs related to the amendment, as well as to repay outstanding revolver borrowings. during 2014, we made a payment of $44.8 million ($39.5 million included in financing cash flows and $5.3 million included in operating cash flows) for the final earnout period under the contingent payment agreement related to our 2011 ecp acquisition. cash generated from exercises of stock options provided $8.2 million and $9.3 million in the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the excess tax benefit from share-based payment arrangements reduced income taxes payable by $14.4 million and $17.8 million in the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we paid $7.6 million and $0.4 million related to taxes for net share settlements of stock-based compensation in the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we paid $12.6 million related to the settlement of foreign currency forward contracts; no such payment occurred in 2015.
off-balance sheet arrangements and future commitments we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or undisclosed borrowings or debt that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to item 303 of regulation s-k under the securities exchange act of 1934. additionally, we do not have any synthetic leases.

business strategy our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value. we seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in net operating income and portfolio growth. to meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of seniors housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, relationship and geographic location.
substantially all of our revenues are derived from operating lease rentals, resident fees and services, and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable. these items represent our primary sources of liquidity to fund distributions and depend upon the continued ability of our obligors to make contractual rent and interest payments to us and the profitability of our operating properties. to the extent that our customers/partners experience operating difficulties and become unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments to us, there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. to mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. our proactive and comprehensive asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections, and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. our internal property management division actively manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of tenant relations, lease expirations, the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships, property performance, capital improvement needs, and market conditions among other things. in monitoring our portfolio, our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze property-specific data. additionally, we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends.  we evaluate the operating environment in each property's market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the facility.  when we identify unacceptable trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate or transfer the risk. through these efforts, we are generally able to intervene at an early stage to address any negative trends, and in so doing, support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment.
in addition to our asset management and research efforts, we also structure our investments to help mitigate payment risk. operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guaranties and/or letters of credit. in addition, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, rental income and resident fees represented 39% and 59%, respectively, of total revenues.  substantially all of our operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures. leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments.
our primary sources of cash include rent and interest receipts, resident fees and services, borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility, public issuances of debt and equity securities, proceeds from investment dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating expenses and general and administrative expenses.  depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash.
we also continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments.  new investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility, internally generated cash and the proceeds from investment dispositions. our investments generate cash from net operating income and principal payments on loans receivable. permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under our primary unsecured credit facility, has historically been provided through a combination of the issuance of public debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt.
depending upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders. it is also likely that investment dispositions may occur in the future. to the extent that investment dispositions exceed new investments, our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected. we expect to reinvest the proceeds from any investment dispositions in new investments. to the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our primary unsecured credit facility. at december 31, 2016, we had $419,378,000 of cash and cash equivalents, $187,842,000 of restricted cash and $2,313,122,000 of available borrowing capacity under our primary unsecured credit facility.
capital market outlook we believe the capital markets remain supportive of our investment strategy. for the year ended december 31, 2016, we raised $1,235,138,000 in aggregate gross proceeds through the issuance of common stock and unsecured debt. the capital raised, in combination with available cash and borrowing capacity under our primary unsecured credit facility, supported pro rata gross new investments of $3,007,040,000 for the year. we expect attractive investment opportunities to remain available in the future as we continue to leverage the benefits of our relationship investment strategy.
key transactions in 2016
capital.  in march 2016, we issued $700,000,000 of 4.25% senior unsecured notes due 2026, generating approximately $688,560,000 of net proceeds.  in may 2016, we closed on a new primary unsecured credit facility that includes a $3,000,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility, a $500,000,000 unsecured term credit facility and a $250,000,000 canadian-denominated unsecured term credit facility plus an option to upsize the unsecured revolving credit facility and the $500,000,000 unsecured term credit facility by up to an additional $1,000,000,000, in the aggregate, and the $250,000,000 canadian-denominated unsecured term credit facility by up to an additional $250,000,000.  the facility also allows us to borrow up to $1,000,000,000 in alternate currencies.  based on our current credit ratings, the unsecured revolving credit facility is priced at 0.90% over libor with a 0.15% annual facility fee and the unsecured term credit facilities are priced at 0.95% over libor for the u.s. tranche and cdor for the canadian tranche.  the unsecured term credit facilities mature on may 13, 2021 and the unsecured revolving credit facility matures on may 13, 2020. the unsecured revolving credit facility can be extended for two successive terms of six months each at our option.  also, for the year ended december 31, 2016, we raised $527,530,000 through our dividend reinvestment program and our equity shelf program (as defined below).

dividends. our board of directors increased the annual cash dividend to $3.48 per common share ($0.87 per share quarterly), as compared to $3.44 per common share for 2016, beginning in february 2017.  the dividend declared for the quarter ended december 31, 2016 represents the 183rd consecutive quarterly dividend payment.
key performance indicators, trends and uncertainties we utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of our business. these indicators are discussed below and relate to operating performance, credit strength and concentration risk.  management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results, in making operating decisions and for budget planning purposes.
operating performance. we believe that net income attributable to common stockholders ("nics") is the most appropriate earnings measure. other useful supplemental measures of our operating performance include funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ("ffo"), net operating income from continuing operations ("noi") and same store noi ("ssnoi"); however, these supplemental measures are not defined by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("u.s. gaap"). please refer to the section entitled "non-gaap financial measures" for further discussion and reconciliations of ffo, noi and ssnoi. these earnings measures are widely used by investors and analysts in the valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies. the following table reflects the recent historical trends of our operating performance measures for the periods presented (in thousands):
year ended december 31,

2014                   2015                    2016
net income attributable to common stockholders                                $446,745                $818,344               $1,012,397
funds from operations attributable to common stockholders                    1,174,081               1,409,640                1,593,143
net operating income from continuing operations                              1,940,188               2,237,569                2,404,177
same store net operating income                                              1,404,158               1,425,795                1,445,748
credit strength. we measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios. the leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to long-term debt, net of cash and irc section 1031 deposits. the coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges (interest, secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends). we expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile. the coverage ratios are based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") which is discussed in further detail, and reconciled to net income, below in "non-gaap financial measures." leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely used by investors, analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, investment recommendations and rating of companies. the following table reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength measures for the periods presented:
year ended december 31,

2014         2015           2016

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations concentration risk. we evaluate our concentration risk in terms of noi by property mix, relationship mix and geographic mix. concentration risk is a valuable measure in understanding what portion of our noi could be at risk if certain sectors were to experience downturns. property mix measures the portion of our noi that relates to our various property types. relationship mix measures the portion of our noi that relates to our top five relationships.  geographic mix measures the portion of our noi that relates to our top five states (or international equivalents). the following table reflects our recent historical trends of concentration risk by noi for the periods indicated below:

capital structure please refer to "credit strength" above for a discussion of our leverage and coverage ratio trends.  our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. certain agreements require us to maintain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. as of december 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements. none of our debt agreements contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings. however, under our primary unsecured credit facility, the ratings on our senior unsecured notes are used to determine the fees and interest charged.  we plan to manage the company to maintain compliance with our debt covenants and with a capital structure consistent with our current profile. any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.
on may 1, 2015, we filed with the securities and exchange commission (1) an open-ended automatic or "universal" shelf registration statement covering an indeterminate amount of future offerings of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants and units and (2) a registration statement in connection with our enhanced dividend reinvestment plan under which we may issue up to 15,000,000 shares of common stock. as of january 31, 2017, 7,737,978 shares of common stock remained available for issuance under this registration statement. we have entered into separate equity distribution agreements with each of ubs securities llc, keybanc capital markets inc. and credit agricole securities (usa) inc. relating to the offer and sale from time to time of up to $630,015,000 aggregate amount of our common stock ("equity shelf program"). as of january 31, 2017, we had $170,640,000 of remaining capacity under the equity shelf program. depending upon market conditions, we anticipate issuing securities under our registration statements to invest in additional properties and to repay borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility.

during the past three years, inflation has not significantly affected our earnings because of the moderate inflation rate. additionally, a large portion of our earnings are derived primarily from long-term investments with predictable rates of return. these investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity, senior unsecured notes, secured debt and borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility. during inflationary periods, which generally are accompanied by rising interest rates, our ability to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing costs. presuming the current inflation rate remains moderate and long-term interest rates do not increase significantly, we believe that inflation will not impact the availability of equity and debt financing for us.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the increase in rental income is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of new properties and the conversion of newly constructed triple-net properties from which we receive rent. certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant's properties.  these escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period.  if gross operating revenues at our facilities and/or the consumer price index do not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase.  sales of real property would offset revenue increases and, to the extent that they exceed new acquisitions, could result in decreased revenues.  our leases could renew above or below current rent rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income.  for the three months ended december 31, 2016, we had no lease renewals but we had 26 leases with rental rate increasers ranging from 0.07% to 0.60% in our triple-net portfolio.
the increase in interest income is attributable to higher loan volume in the current year, which includes first mortgage loans to genesis healthcare.  the decrease in other income is due to the receipt of an early prepayment fee in 2015 related to a real estate loan receivable.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, we completed two triple-net construction projects totaling $46,094,000 or $251,880 per bed/unit and one expansion project totaling $2,879,000. the following is a summary of triple-net construction projects pending as of december 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):

in april 2011, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the real estate assets of privately-owned genesis healthcare corporation.  in conjunction with this transaction, we received the option to acquire an ownership interest in genesis healthcare.  in february 2015, genesis healthcare closed on a transaction to merge with skilled healthcare group to become a publicly traded company which required us to record the value of the derivative asset due to the net settlement feature.  this event resulted in $58,427,000 gain. during the fourth quarter of 2015, the cost basis of this investment exceeded the fair value.  management performed an assessment to determine whether the decline in fair value was other than temporary and concluded that it was.  as a result, we recognized an other than temporary impairment charge of $35,648,000 which is recorded in other expense.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations depreciation and amortization increased primarily as a result of new property acquisitions and the conversions of newly constructed properties. to the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, our provision for depreciation and amortization will change accordingly.
transaction costs are costs incurred with property acquisitions including due diligence costs, fees for legal and valuation services, the termination of pre-existing relationships, lease termination expenses and other similar costs.  the change in transaction costs from year to year is primarily a function of investment volume.  the fluctuations in loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt is primarily attributable to the volume of extinguishments and terms of the related secured debt.
changes in gains on sales of properties are related to the volume of property sales and the sales prices.  we recognized impairment losses on certain held-for-sale properties as the fair value less estimated costs to sell exceeded our carrying values.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded a provision for loan loss related to the restructuring of two first mortgage loans.  during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2015, we did not record a provision for loan loss or record loan write-offs.  the provision for loan losses is related to our critical accounting estimate for the allowance for loan losses and is discussed in "critical accounting policies" and note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.
a portion of our triple-net properties were formed through partnerships.  income or loss from unconsolidated entities represents our share of net income or losses from partnerships where we are the noncontrolling partner.  net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents our partners' share of net income relating to those partnerships where we are the controlling partner.

fluctuations in revenues and property operating expenses are primarily a result of acquisitions and the movement of u.s. and foreign currency exchange rates.  the increase in other income for the year ended december 31, 2016 is primarily a result of insurance proceeds received relating to a property as well as a bargain purchase gain recognized in conjunction with a single property acquisition.  the fluctuations in depreciation and amortization are due to the net impact of acquisitions and variations in amortization of short-lived intangible assets.  to the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, these amounts will change accordingly.  losses from unconsolidated entities are primarily attributable to depreciation and amortization of short-lived

the fluctuations in gains/losses on debt extinguishments is primarily attributable the volume of extinguishments and terms of the related secured debt.  during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded impairment charges totaling $12,403,000 relating to two properties.  transaction costs represent costs incurred with property acquisitions (including due diligence costs, fees for legal and valuation services, and termination of pre-existing relationships computed based on the fair value of the assets acquired), lease termination fees and other similar costs.  the change in transaction costs from year to year is primarily a function of investment volume.  the majority of our seniors housing operating properties are formed through partnership interests.  net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents our partners' share of net income or loss related to those partnerships where we are the controlling partner.

the increase in rental income is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of new properties and the conversion of newly constructed outpatient medical properties from which we receive rent. certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index.  these escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period.  if the consumer price index does not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase.  revenue from real property that is sold would offset revenue increases and, to the extent that revenues from sold properties exceed those from new acquisitions, we would experience decreased revenues.  our leases could renew above or below current rent rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income.  for the

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations three months ended december 31, 2016, our consolidated outpatient medical portfolio signed 81,930 square feet of new leases and 305,176 square feet of renewals.  the weighted-average term of these leases was eight years, with a rate of $35.61 per square foot and tenant improvement and lease commission costs of $18.23 per square foot.  substantially all of these leases during the referenced quarter contain an annual fixed or contingent escalation rent structure ranging from the change in cpi to 5%.
the increase in other income is primarily attributable to the acquisition of a controlling interest in a portfolio of properties that were historically reported as unconsolidated property investments, and subsequent adjustments made to certain contingent receivables.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, we completed five outpatient medical construction projects representing $108,001,000 or $304 per square foot. the following is a summary of outpatient medical construction projects pending as of december 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):

the increases in property operating expenses and depreciation and amortization are primarily attributable to acquisitions and construction conversions of new outpatient medical facilities for which we incur certain property operating expenses. transaction costs represent costs incurred with property acquisitions including due diligence costs, fees for legal and valuation services, termination of pre-existing relationships, a lease termination expense and other similar costs. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded a provision for loan loss related to our critical accounting estimate for the allowance for loan losses discussed in "critical accounting policies" and note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. in addition, we recognized impairment losses on certain held-for-sale properties as the fair value less estimated costs to sell exceeded our carrying values. income from unconsolidated entities represents our share of net income or losses related to the periods for which we held a joint venture investment with forest city enterprises and certain unconsolidated property investments. changes in gains/losses on sales of properties are related to volume of property sales and the sales prices.
a portion of our outpatient medical properties were formed through partnerships.  net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents our partners' share of net income or loss relating to those partnerships where we are the controlling partner.

the change in interest expense on senior unsecured notes is due to the net effect of issuances and extinguishments.  please refer to note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.  the increases in interest expense are attributed to the £500,000,000 sterling-denominated senior unsecured notes issued in november 2014, the $300,000,000 canadian-denominated senior unsecured notes issued in november 2015 and the $700,000,000 of 4.25% senior unsecured notes issued in march 2016.  loan expense represents the amortization of deferred loan costs incurred in connection with the issuance and amendments of debt. loan expense changes are due to amortization of charges for costs incurred in connection with senior unsecured note issuances.  the change in interest expense on our primary unsecured credit facility is due primarily to the net effect and timing of draws, paydowns and variable interest rate changes.  please refer to note 9 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our primary unsecured credit facility.
general and administrative expenses for 2014 included $19,688,000 of ceo transition costs.  excluding these costs, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were 3.63%, 3.82% and 3.69%, respectively. the loss on extinguishment of debt in 2015 is primarily due to the early extinguishment of the 2016 senior unsecured notes. the loss on extinguishment of debt in 2016 is due to the early extinguishment of the 2017 senior unsecured notes. other expenses in 2016 and 2015 included costs associated with the departure of executive officers.  other expenses in 2015 also included costs associated with the termination of our investment in a strategic outpatient medical partnership.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other non-gaap financial measures we believe that net income, as defined by u.s. gaap, is the most appropriate earnings measurement. however, we consider funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ("ffo"), net operating income from continuing operations ("noi"), same store noi ("ssnoi"), ebitda and adjusted ebitda to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with u.s. gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. however, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. in response, the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") created ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance for reits that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. ffo, as defined by nareit, means net income attributable to common stockholders, computed in accordance with u.s. gaap, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and impairment of depreciable assets, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests.
noi is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties. we define noi as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property operating expenses. property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing, maintaining and servicing tenants for our seniors housing operating and medical facility properties.  these expenses include, but are not limited to, property-related payroll and benefits, property management fees, marketing, housekeeping, food service, maintenance, utilities, property taxes and insurance.  general and administrative expenses represent costs unrelated to property operations or transaction costs.  these expenses include, but are not limited to, payroll and benefits, professional services, office expenses and depreciation of corporate fixed assets.  ssnoi is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties under a consistent population which eliminates changes in the composition of our portfolio.  as used herein, same store is generally defined as those revenue-generating properties in the portfolio for the reporting period subsequent to january 1, 2015.  land parcels, loans and sub-leases as well as any properties acquired, developed/redeveloped, transitioned, sold or classified as held for sale during that period are excluded from the same store amounts.  we believe noi and ssnoi provide investors relevant and useful information because they measure the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. we use noi and ssnoi to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties.
ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. we believe that ebitda, along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities, is an important supplemental measure because it provides additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations. we primarily utilize ebitda to measure our interest coverage ratio, which represents ebitda divided by total interest, and our fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents ebitda divided by fixed charges. fixed charges include total interest, secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends.
a covenant in our primary unsecured credit facility contains a financial ratio based on a definition of ebitda that is specific to that agreement. failure to satisfy these covenants could result in an event of default that could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. due to the materiality of these debt agreements and the financial covenants, we have disclosed adjusted ebitda, which represents ebitda as defined above and adjusted for items per our covenant. we use adjusted ebitda to measure our adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents adjusted ebitda divided by fixed charges on a trailing twelve months basis. fixed charges include total interest (excluding capitalized interest and non-cash interest expenses), secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends. our covenant requires an adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.50 times.
other than adjusted ebitda, our supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results and in making operating decisions. additionally, these measures are utilized by the board of directors to evaluate management. adjusted ebitda is used to demonstrate our compliance with a comparable financial covenant in our primary unsecured credit facility and is not being presented for use by investors for any other purpose. none of our supplemental measures represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with u.s. gaap and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. finally, the supplemental measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions.  management considers accounting estimates or assumptions critical if:
·         the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and
·         the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them.  management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely to change in the future.  however, since these estimates require assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, they bear the risk of change.  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.  please refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact us and for the impact of new accounting standards, including accounting pronouncements that were issued but not yet adopted by us.
the following table presents information about our critical accounting policies, as well as the material assumptions used to develop each estimate:

we compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight-line method based on their estimated useful lives which range from 15 to

in accordance with u.s. gaap, which requires that revenue be recognized after   we evaluate collectability based on assumptions and other considerations four basic criteria are met. these four criteria include persuasive evidence    including, but not limited to, the certainty of payment, payment history, the of an arrangement, the rendering of service, fixed and determinable income      financial strength of the investment's underlying operations as measured by and reasonably assured collectability. if the collectability of revenue is      cash flows and payment coverages, the value of the underlying collateral and determined incorrectly, the amount and timing of our reported revenue could     guaranties and current economic conditions.
be significantly affected. interest income on loans is recognized as earned     if our evaluation based upon the principal amount outstanding subject to an evaluation of         indicates that collectability is not reasonably assured, we may place an collectability risk. substantially all of our operating leases contain fixed    investment on non-accrual or reserve against all or a portion of current and/or contingent escalating rent structures. leases with fixed annual rental   income as an offset to revenue.
escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. we recognize resident fees and services, other than move-in fees, monthly as services are provided. lease agreements with residents generally have a term of one year and are cancelable by the resident with 30 days' notice.

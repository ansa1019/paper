item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview wabtec is one of the world's largest providers of value-added, technology-based products and services for the global rail industry. our products are found on virtually all u.s. locomotives, freight cars and passenger transit vehicles, as well as in more than 100 countries throughout the world. our products enhance safety, improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers, and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles. wabtec is a global company with operations in 30 countries. in 2016, about 54% of the company's revenues came from customers outside the u.s.
management review and future outlook wabtec's long-term financial goals are to generate cash flow from operations in excess of net income, maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital, increase margins through strict attention to cost controls and implementation of the wabtec excellence program, and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy, including product innovation and new technologies, global and market expansion, aftermarket products and services, and acquisitions. in addition, management evaluates the company's current operational performance through measures such as quality and on-time delivery.
the company monitors a variety of factors and statistics to gauge market activity. freight rail markets around the world are driven primarily by overall economic conditions and activity, while transit markets are driven primarily by government funding and passenger ridership.  changes in these market drivers can cause fluctuations in demand for wabtec's product and services.  in its 2016 study, unife estimates the accessible global market for railway products and services is more than $100 billion, and it is expected to grow at about 3.2% annually through 2021, with the highest expected growth rates in asia pacific and europe.
in north america, the aar compiles statistics that gauge the level of activity in the freight rail industry, including carloadings, which is generally referred to as "rail traffic".  based on changes in rail traffic trends, railroads can increase or decrease purchases of new locomotives and freight cars.  in 2016, north american carloadings decreased 4.5%, including a 7.2% decrease in commodity carloadings and a 1.5% decrease in intermodal carloadings. deliveries of new locomotives decreased 20%, and deliveries of new freight cars decreased 27%. in 2017, we expect locomotive and freight car deliveries to be lower than in 2016. unife projects an annual growth rate of about 2.3% in north america, but the actual figure depends on the growth of the economy.
in north america, the american public transportation association ("apta") compiles ridership statistics and trends.  based on preliminary figures for 2016, ridership decreased about 1.0% in the u.s. and was about flat in canada.  ridership provides fare box revenues to transit authorities, which use these funds, along with state and local money, primarily, for equipment maintenance.  in 2015, the u.s. congress passed a new, five-year transportation funding bill, which includes annual spending increases.  a majority of the money that transit agencies spend to purchase new equipment or infrastructure comes from the federal government.
wabtec continues to expand its presence in freight rail and passenger transit markets outside the u.s., particularly in europe and asia pacific. to gauge activity in these markets, we monitor trends in rail traffic and the spending plans of our customers.  in europe, the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market, which is significantly larger than the transit market in the u.s. our presence in the u.k. and continental europe, and especially the acquisition of a majority ownership of faiveley transport, has positioned the company to take advantage of this market. unife projects the western european rail market to grow annually by about 3.6% during the next five years, with france and germany expected to invest in new rolling stock.  unife projects the market in asia-pacific, the world's second largest according to the study, to grow annually by about 5.4%, primarily reflecting strong spending in china.  other growth markets around the world, according to unife, include latin america, projected to grow at about 2.1%; africa/middle east, projected to grow at about 1.9%; and russia-cis, projected to grow at about 1.5%.  actual growth rates will be affected by the general global economic conditions and specific economic conditions in each market. through wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures, wabtec has a presence in every key freight rail and passenger transit market around the world.
in 2016 and beyond, general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally will have an impact on our sales and operations. to the extent that these factors cause instability of capital markets, shortages of raw materials or component parts, longer sales cycles, deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. in addition, we face risks associated with our four-point growth strategy including the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies
23
developed by the industry and the company, and risks inherent in global expansion. when necessary, we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks.
acquisition of faiveley transport s.a.
on july 27, 2015, the company announced plans to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of faiveley transport s.a. ("faiveley transport") under the terms of a share purchase agreement (the "share purchase agreement") and a tender offer agreement (the "tender offer agreement"). on october 24, 2016, the company entered into amendments to the share purchase agreement and the tender offer agreement. faiveley transport is a leading global provider of value-added, integrated systems and services for the railway industry with annual sales of about $1.2 billion and more than 5,700 employees in 24 countries. faiveley transport supplies railway manufacturers, operators and maintenance providers with a range of valued-added, technology-based systems and services in energy & comfort (air conditioning, power collectors and converters, and passenger information), access & mobility (passenger access systems and platform doors), and brakes and safety (braking systems and couplers).
the transaction has been structured in three steps:
•   wabtec made an irrevocable offer to the owners of approximately 51% of faiveley transport's shares for a purchase price of €100 per share, payable between 25% and 45% in cash at the election of those shareholders with the remainder in common stock.
•   upon completion of required labor group consultations, on october 6, 2015, the 51% shareholders entered into a definitive share purchase agreement, which was amended on october 24, 2016, and faiveley transport entered into the tender offer agreement with wabtec which was also amended on october 24, 2016.
•   upon completing the share purchase under the share purchase agreement, wabtec commenced a tender offer for the remaining publicly traded faiveley transport shares. the public shareholders will have the option to elect to receive €100 per share in cash or wabtec common stock. the common stock portion of the consideration is subject to a cap on issuance of faiveley common shares that will be equivalent to the rates of cash and stock elected by the 51% owners. wabtec intends to delist faiveley transport from euronext after the tender offer if minority interests represent less than 5%.
on november 30, 2016, the company acquired majority ownership of faiveley transport, after completing the purchase of the faiveley family's ownership interest, which represented approximately 51% of outstanding share capital and approximately 49% of the outstanding voting shares of faiveley transport. under the variable interest entity model the company concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of faiveley transport as it possesses the power to direct the activities of faiveley transport that most significantly impact its economic performance and it possesses the obligation and right to absorb losses and benefits from faiveley transport; therefore, faiveley transport was consolidated by wabtec under the variable interest model at acquisition. based on the company's $84.77 stock price on november 30, 2016, the aggregate value of consideration paid for the faiveley transport family's ownership interest was $978.1 million, including $534.7 million in stock or approximately 6.3 million shares, $211.8 million in cash, $409.9 million in debt assumed, less $178.3 million in cash acquired. the company launched a tender offer for the remaining publicly traded faiveley transport shares in december 2016. through the tender offer, the public shareholders of faiveley transport will have the option to elect to receive €100 per share of faiveley transport in cash or 1.1538 wabtec common shares per share of faiveley transport. on february 3, 2017, the initial cash tender offer was closed which resulted in the company acquiring an additional 27.5% of outstanding share capital of faiveley transport for approximately $411.8 million in cash and $25.2 million in wabtec stock. the tender offer will be reopened with dates and duration to be determined by the french regulator. the total purchase price for 100% of the shares of faiveley transport is approximately $1.7 billion, including assumed debt and net of cash acquired. the approximate $1.0 billion cash portion of the transaction is being funded from cash on hand, the net proceeds from a recent $750 million senior notes offering and the company's existing revolving credit facility and term note.

net sales decreased by $376.8 million to $2,931.2 million in 2016 from $3,308.0 million in 2015. the decrease is primarily due to lower sales for specialty products and electronics of $402.7 million and lower brake products sales of $55.1 million due to decreased demand for freight products attributable to lower freight car and locomotive builds, and train control and signaling products and services, and lower other products sales of $26.9 million from decreased demand for freight spare part kits. acquisitions increased sales $189.2 million and unfavorable foreign exchange decreased sales $71.1 million.
freight segment sales decreased by $511.6 million, or 24.9%, primarily due to a $438.3 million decrease for specialty products and electronics sales from lower demand for freight original equipment rail products and train control and signaling products attributable to lower freight car and locomotive builds, a decrease of $50.7 million for brake products sales from
25
lower demand for original equipment brakes and aftermarket services, a decrease of $33.7 million for remanufacturing, overhaul and build sales due to a large locomotive rebuild contract that completed in 2016, and a decrease of $26.9 million for other product sales from decreased demand for freight spare part kits. acquisitions increased sales by $55.1 million and unfavorable foreign exchange decreased sales by $17.2 million.
transit segment sales increased by $134.8 million, or 10.8%, primarily due to a $35.6 million increase for specialty products and electronics from higher demand for original equipment conduction systems and current collectors, and an increase of $22.7 million for remanufacturing, overhaul and build sales from higher demand for aftermarket locomotive builds. acquisitions increased sales by $134.1 million and unfavorable foreign exchange decreased sales by $53.9 million.

cost of sales decreased by $253.2 million to $2,006.9 million in 2016 compared to $2,260.2 million in the same period of 2015.  for the twelve months ended 2016, cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 68.4% compared to 68.3% in the same period of 2015.
freight segment cost of sales decreased 0.5% as a percentage of sales to 65.8% in 2016 compared to 66.3% for the same period of 2015. the decrease as a percentage of sales is primarily related to sales with lower material content, lower overall material costs due to ongoing sourcing efforts, and decreases in various commodity prices partially offset by an increase in overhead costs as a percentage of sales which is primarily due to certain fixed overhead costs.
transit segment cost of sales decreased 0.3% as a percentage of sales to 71.4% in 2016 compared to 71.7% for the same period in 2015. the decrease is primarily due to better margin performance from prior year acquisitions and ongoing sourcing savings. these benefits were partially offset by $13.8 million of costs related to adjustments on certain long-term contracts.
included in cost of sales is warranty expense. the provision for warranty expense is generally established for specific losses, along with historical estimates of customer claims as a percentage of sales, which can cause variability in warranty expense between quarters. warranty expense was $28.9 million in 2016 compared to $35.4 million in 2015.

freight segment operating expenses decreased $26.1 million, or 12.5%, in 2016 and increased 160 basis points to 11.8% of sales.  the decrease is primarily attributable to reduced sales volumes and realized benefits associated with the cost saving initiatives undertaken in 2016 partially offset by $8.8 million of incremental operating expenses from acquisitions.
transit segment operating expenses increased $20.2 million, or 9.8%, in 2016 and decreased 10 basis points to 16.3% of sales.  the increase is primarily related to $26.2 million of incremental operating expenses related to acquisitions and $7.1 million related to the faiveley transport transaction.  this increase is partially offset by lower operating expenses due to foreign exchange.
corporate non-allocated operating expenses increased $31.5 million in 2016 primarily due to $31.8 million of costs related to the faiveley acquisition partially offset by realized benefits from cost saving initiatives in 2016.
interest expense, net overall interest expense, net, increased $25.7 million in 2016 due to a higher overall debt balance in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily related to the faiveley transport acquisition and $14.9 million of debt refinancing costs. refer to note 8 of the "notes to condensed consolidated financial statements" for additional information on debt.
other expense, net other expense, net, decreased $2.3 million to $3.0 million for 2016, compared to 2015 primarily due to foreign exchange adjustments.
income taxes the effective income tax rate was 24.1% and 31.9% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. the decrease in the effective rate is primarily the result of an enacted tax rate change which reduces the corporate income tax rate in france and a higher earnings mix in lower tax rate jurisdictions, partially offset by 2016 transaction charges related to the acquisition of faiveley transport that are not deductible.

cost of sales increased by $151.7 million to $2,260.2 million in 2015 compared to $2,108.5 million in the same period of 2014. for the twelve months ended 2015, cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 68.3% compared to 69.3% in the same period of 2014. the decrease of cost of sales as a percentage of sales is due to lower material costs primarily due to lower original equipment transit locomotive sales and higher specialty product and electronics sales.
freight segment cost of sales increased 0.5% as a percentage of sales to 66.3% in 2015 compared to 65.8% for the same period of 2014. the increase is primarily related to slightly lower margins related to recent acquisitions, and cost overruns on a project nearing completion, partially offset by higher specialty products and electronics sales.
transit segment cost of sales decreased 2.2% as a percentage of sales to 71.7% in 2015 compared to 73.9% for the same period in 2014. the decrease in 2015 is primarily due to lower material costs associated with lower original equipment locomotive sales and lower original equipment and aftermarket brake product sales which carry higher raw material content, partially offset by additional costs incurred on the closeout of several projects.
included in cost of sales is warranty expense. the provision for warranty expense is generally established for specific losses, along with historical estimates of customer claims as a percentage of sales, which can cause variability in warranty expense between quarters. warranty expense for the twelve months ended december 31, 2015 increased $1.3 million to $35.4 million from $34.1 million in 2014 primarily due to increased sales.
gross profit for the twelve months ended december 31, 2015 increased $111.8 million to $1,047.8 million from $936.0 million for the twelve months ended december 2014 and the gross profit margin increased 100 basis points to 31.7% from 30.7% at december 31, 2014. these increases are due to higher sales volume, favorable sales mix, and the reasons discussed above.

operating activities. cash provided by operations in 2016 was $449.3 million compared with $448.3 million in 2015. in comparison to 2015, cash provided by operations in 2016 increased slightly due to positive changes in other assets and liabilities and net working capital, mostly offset by lower operating results (net income plus net-add back for non-cash transactions in earnings). other assets and liabilities changed favorably by $49.5 million primarily due to an increase in other accrued liabilities. the favorable changes in working capital primarily related to a $57.7 million favorable change in accounts payable principally due to the timing of payments, $25.2 million favorable change in inventory driven by successful efforts to control the amount of inventory on hand. these favorable changes in working capital were partially offset by an unfavorable change in accrued income taxes of $33.5 million driven by lower income taxes owed at the end of 2016 given the decrease in pretax income.
cash provided by operations in 2015 was $448.3 million compared with $472.4 million in 2014. in comparison to 2014, cash provided by operations in 2015 decreased due to unfavorable working capital requirements partially offset by higher operating results. the unfavorable working capital requirements primarily related to an unfavorable change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $132.0 million and $86.9 million, respectively. these cash outflows were partially offset by a favorable change in accounts receivable of $38.9 million driven by collections due to achieving certain project related milestones and a favorable change in inventory of $84.2 million due to successful efforts to control the amount of inventory on hand.
investing activities. in 2016, 2015 and 2014, cash used in investing activities was $775.1 million, $380.1 million and $347.7 million, respectively. the major components of the cash outflow in 2016 were planned additions to property, plant, and equipment of $50.2 million for continued investments in our facilities and manufacturing processes and $183.1 million in net cash paid for acquisitions.  this compares to $49.4 million for property, plant, and equipment and $129.6 million in net cash paid for acquisitions in 2015.  additionally, $744.7 million of cash was deposited into escrow to finance the pending tender offer for the purchase the noncontrolling interest of faiveley transport, which was partially offset by $202.9 million of cash deposited into escrow to finance the purchase of a controlling interest in faiveley transport in 2015 which was released from escrow in 2016. refer to note 3 of the "notes to condensed consolidated financial statements" for additional information on acquisitions.

credit agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed as described below. at december 31, 2016, the company had available bank borrowing capacity, net of $20.2 million of letters of credit, of approximately $783.7 million, subject to certain financial covenant restrictions.
the term loan was drawn on november 25, 2016. the company incurred a 10 basis point commitment fee from june 22, 2016 until the initial draw on november 25, 2016.
under the 2016 refinancing credit agreement, the company may elect a base rate of interest for u.s. dollar denominated loans or, for certain currencies, an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate ("libor") of interest, or other rates appropriate for such currencies (in any case, "the alternate rate"). the base rate adjusts on a daily basis and is the greater of the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% per annum, the pnc, n.a. prime rate or the daily libor rate plus 100 basis points, plus a margin that ranges from 0 to 75 basis points. the alternate rate is based on the quoted rates specific to the applicable currency, plus a margin that ranges from 75 to 175 basis points. both the base rate and alternate rate margins are dependent on the company's consolidated total indebtedness to ebitda ratios. the initial base rate margin is 0 basis points and the alternate rate margin is 175 basis points.
at december 31, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on the company's variable rate debt was 2.51%.  on january 12, 2012, the company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of $150.0 million. the effective date of the interest rate swap agreement is july 31, 2013, and the termination date was november 7, 2016. the impact of the interest rate swap agreement converted a portion of the company's outstanding debt from a variable rate to a fixed-rate borrowing. during the term of the interest rate swap agreement the interest rate on the notional value was fixed at 1.415% plus the alternate rate margin. on june 5, 2014, the company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of $150.0 million.  the effective date of the interest rate swap agreement is november 7, 2016, and the termination date is december 19, 2018.  the impact of the interest rate swap agreement converts a portion of the company's outstanding debt from a variable rate to a fixed-rate borrowing.  during the term of the interest rate swap agreement the interest rate on the notional value will be fixed at 2.56% plus the alternate rate margin.  as for these agreements, the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties.  however, since only the cash interest payments are exchanged, exposure is significantly less than the notional amount.  the counterparties are large financial institutions with excellent credit ratings and history of performance.  the company currently believes the risk of nonperformance is negligible.
the 2016 refinancing credit agreement limits the company's ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. the 2016 refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio of 3.0 and a maximum debt to ebitda ratio of 3.25. the company is in compliance with the restrictions and covenants of the 2016 refinancing credit agreement and does not expect that these measurements will limit the company in executing our operating activities.

critical accounting estimates the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. areas of uncertainty that require judgments, estimates and assumptions include the accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories, the testing of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment, warranty reserves, pensions and other postretirement benefits, stock based compensation and tax matters. management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates, and actual results will inevitably differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the company's financial statements at any given time. despite these inherent limitations, management believes that management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company. a discussion of the judgments and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives and environmental matters can be found in notes 2 and 17, respectively, in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" included in part iv, item 15 of this report.
a summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in note 2 in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" included in part iv, item 15 of this report and is incorporated by reference herein. management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition.
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts:
description the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts to cover anticipated losses on uncollectible accounts receivable.
judgments and uncertainties  the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions  if our estimates regarding the collectability of troubled accounts, and/or our actual losses within our receivable portfolio exceed our historical experience, we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our allowance for doubtful accounts.
37
inventories:
description inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and are reviewed to ensure that an adequate provision is recognized for excess, slow moving and obsolete inventories.
judgments and uncertainties cost is determined under the first-in, first-out (fifo) method. inventory costs include material, labor and overhead. the company compares inventory components to prior year sales history and current backlog and anticipated future requirements. to the extent that inventory parts exceed estimated usage and demand, a reserve is recognized to reduce the carrying value of inventory. also, specific reserves are established for known inventory obsolescence.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if the market value of our products were to decrease due to changing market conditions, the company could be at risk of incurring write-downs to adjust inventory value to a market value lower than stated cost. if our estimates regarding sales and backlog requirements are inaccurate, we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventory.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles:
description goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are required to be tested for impairment at least annually. the company performs its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter and more frequently when indicators of impairment are present. the company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value (including goodwill).
judgments and uncertainties a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the impairment test, including the identification of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, wabtec specific events and share price trends and making the assessment on whether each relevant factor will impact the impairment test positively or negatively and the magnitude of any such amount.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated. however, actual amounts realized may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill. if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations. for example, based on the quantitative analysis performed as of october 1, 2016, a decline in the terminal growth rate greater than 50 basis points would decrease fair market value by $477 million, or an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital by 100 basis points would result in a decrease in fair market value by $1,191 million. even with such changes the fair value of the reporting units would be greater than their net book values, necessitating no step 2 calculations. see note 2 in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" included in part iv, item 15 of this report for additional discussion regarding impairment testing.
warranty reserves:
description the company provides warranty reserves to cover expected costs from repairing or replacing products with durability, quality or workmanship issues occurring during established warranty periods.
judgments and uncertainties in general, reserves are provided for as a percentage of sales, based on historical experience. in addition, specific reserves are established for known warranty issues and their estimable losses.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments used to calculate our warranty liability, the company may be at risk of realizing material gains or losses.
accounting for pensions and postretirement benefits:
description the company provides pension and postretirement benefits for its employees.  these amounts are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions, including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the long-term rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, medical costs, retirement age and mortality).
38
judgments and uncertainties significant judgments and estimates are used in determining the liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits. the rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the rates available at year-end on debt instruments that could be used to settle the obligations of the plan. the long-term rate of return is estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a five-year average market value of assets.  the differences between actual and expected asset returns are recognized in expense using the normal amortization of gains and losses per asc 715.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if assumptions used in determining the pension and other postretirement benefits change significantly, these costs can fluctuate materially from period to period. the key assumptions in determining the pension and other postretirement expense and obligation include the discount rate, expected return on assets and health care cost trend rate. for example, a 1% decrease or increase in the discount rate used in determining the pension and postretirement expense would increase expense $1.8 million or decrease expense $1.4 million, respectively. a 1% decrease or increase in the discount rate used in determining the pension and postretirement obligation would increase the obligation $63.4 million or decrease the obligation $49.8 million, respectively. a 1% decrease or increase in the expected return on assets used in determining the pension expense would increase or decrease expense $2.7 million. if the actual asset values at december 31, 2016 had been 1% lower, the amortization of losses in the following year would decrease $0.2 million. a 1% decrease or increase in the health care cost trend rate used in determining the postretirement expense would increase or decrease the expense less than $0.1 million. a 1% decrease or increase in the health care cost trend rate used in determining the postretirement obligation would increase or decrease the obligation $0.3 million.
stock-based compensation:
description the company has issued incentive stock units to eligible employees that vest upon attainment of certain cumulative three-year performance goals. the program is structured as a rolling three-year plan; each year starts a new three-year performance cycle with the most recently completed cycle being 2014-2016. no incentive stock units will vest for performance below the three-year cumulative threshold.  the company utilizes an economic profit measure for this performance goal.  economic profit is a measure of the extent to which the company produces financial results in excess of its cost of capital.  based on the company's achievement of the threshold and three-year cumulative performance, the stock units vested can range from 0% to 200% of the shares granted.
judgments and uncertainties significant judgments and estimates are used in determining the estimated three-year performance, which is then used to estimate the total shares expected to vest over the three year vesting cycle and corresponding expense based on the grant date fair value of the award.  when determining the estimated three-year performance, the company utilizes a combination of historical actual results, budgeted results and forecasts.  in the initial grant year of a performance cycle, the company estimates the three-year performance at 100%.  as actual performance results for a cycle begin to accumulate and the company completes its budgeting and forecasting cycles the performance estimates are updated.  these judgments and estimates are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if assumptions used in determining the estimated three-year performance change significantly, stock-based compensation expense related to the unvested incentive stock awards can fluctuate materially from period to period.  for example a 10% decrease or increase in the estimated vesting percentage for incentive stock awards would decrease or increase stock-based compensation expense by approximately $0.8 million and $0.8 million, respectively.
income taxes:
description wabtec records an estimated liability or benefit for income and other taxes based on what it determines will likely be paid in various tax jurisdictions in which it operates in accordance with asc 740-10 accounting for income taxes and accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.
judgments and uncertainties the estimate of our tax obligations are uncertain because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions, as well as realization of our deferred tax assets. asc 740-10 establishes a recognition and measurement threshold to determine the amount of tax benefit that should be recognized related to uncertain tax positions.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions management uses its best judgment in the determination of these amounts. however, the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts recorded. an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs
39
from the recorded amount. a deferred tax valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
revenue recognition:
description revenue is recognized in accordance with asc-605 "revenue recognition." the company recognizes revenues on long-term contracts based on the percentage of completion method of accounting. the units-of-delivery method or other input-based or output-based measures, as appropriate, are used to measure the progress toward completion of individual contracts. contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum quarterly and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as such amounts are determined. certain pre-production costs relating to long term production and supply contracts have been deferred and will be recognized over the life of the contracts.
judgments and uncertainties revenue is recognized when products have been shipped to the respective customers, title has passed and the price for the product has been determined. contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated profit margin percentages. for each contract with revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method, the amount reported as revenues is determined by calculating cost incurred to date as a percentage of the total expected contract costs to determine the percentage of total contract revenue to be recognized in the current period. due to the size, duration and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. for long-term contracts, revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised quarterly at a minimum and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as such amounts are determined. pre-production costs are recognized over the expected life of the contract usually based on the company's progress toward the estimated number of units expected to be delivered under the production or supply contract.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions should market conditions and customer demands dictate changes to our standard shipping terms, the company may be impacted by longer than typical revenue recognition cycles. the development of expected contract costs and contract profit margin percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts. due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process, it is likely that materially different revenue amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. if the combined profit margin for all contracts recognized on the percentage of completion method during 2016 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased revenue and gross profit for the year by approximately $12.1 million. a few of our contracts are expected to be completed in a loss position. provisions are made currently for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts. a charge to expense for unrecognized portions of pre-production costs could be realized if the company's estimate of the number of units to be delivered changes or the underlying contract is cancelled.

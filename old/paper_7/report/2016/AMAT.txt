item 7:   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to facilitate an understanding of applied's business and results of operations. this md&a should be read in conjunction with applied's consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k. the following discussion contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement set forth at the beginning of this form 10-k. md&a consists of the following sections:
•   overview: a summary of applied's business and measurements
•   results of operations: a discussion of operating results
•   segment information: a discussion of segment operating results
•   recent accounting pronouncements: a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and its impact to applied's consolidated financial statements
•   financial condition, liquidity and capital resources: an analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash
•   off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations
•   critical accounting policies and estimates: a discussion of critical accounting policies that require the exercise of judgments and estimates
•   non-gaap adjusted results: a presentation of results reconciling gaap to non-gaap adjusted measures overview applied provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the global semiconductor, display, and related industries. applied's customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips, liquid crystal and other displays, and other electronic devices. these customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components. applied operates in three reportable segments: semiconductor systems (previously silicon systems), applied global services, and display and adjacent markets (previously display). a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements. a discussion of factors that could affect applied's operations is set forth under "risk factors" in part i, item 1a, which is incorporated herein by reference. product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in the united states, europe, israel, and asia. applied's broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force.
applied's results are driven primarily by worldwide demand for semiconductors and displays, which in turn depends on end-user demand for electronic products. each of applied's businesses is subject to variable industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips, display technologies, and other electronic devices, as well as other factors, such as global economic and market conditions, and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes. in addition, a significant driver in the semiconductor and display industries is end-demand for mobile consumer products, which is characterized by seasonality that impacts the timing of customer investments in manufacturing equipment and, in turn, applied's business. in light of these conditions, applied's results can vary significantly year-over-year, as well as quarter-over-quarter.

applied's strategic priorities include developing products that help solve customers' challenges at technology inflections; expanding its served market opportunities in the semiconductor and display industries; and growing its services business.
mobility, and the increasing technological functionality of mobile devices, continues to be a strong driver of semiconductor industry spending. during fiscal 2016, memory manufacturers invested in technology upgrades and additional capacity, both of which were driven primarily by the transition from planar nand to 3d nand. foundry customers also invested in technology upgrades and new capacity to meet demand for advanced mobile chips. mobility investments, including increasing investments in new technology such as oled for mobile devices, represents a significant driver of display industry spending, which has resulted in higher manufacturing capacity expansion for mobile applications. as a result, new orders for display equipment increased in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year. demand for larger lcd tvs is also a factor for display industry investments, although demand for tv manufacturing equipment remains susceptible to cyclical conditions.
in fiscal 2017, applied expects these trends to continue to drive demand for the semiconductor industry, and in turn for the semiconductor systems segment. applied also expects healthy spending in semiconductor spares and services, and increased spending for display manufacturing equipment in fiscal 2017.
effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, applied began to account for its flexible coating systems (previously in energy and environmental solutions) and display upgrade equipment (previously in applied global services) under the display and adjacent markets segment. as a result of the change, applied's solar business (previously in energy and environmental solutions) is included in corporate and other as it did not meet the threshold for a separate reportable segment. results for prior periods have been recast to conform to the current presentation.

applied's future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides. development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product, which typically has a shorter development cycle, or a new product, which typically has a longer development cycle. most of applied's existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies, materials and processes. in certain instances, applied acquires technologies, either in existing or new product areas, to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market.
management believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rd&e to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers' most advanced designs. applied has maintained and intends to continue its commitment to investing in rd&e in order to continue to offer new products and technologies.
in fiscal 2016, applied increased its rd&e investments in new product growth across semiconductor systems and display and adjacent markets, including etch, e-beam inspection, new materials engineering solutions to improve transistor performance and oled displays. applied's investments in etch were focused on supporting the adoption of the producer® selectratm etch system, an extreme selectivity etch tool for enabling continued scaling of 3d logic and memory chips. the investment in e-beam inspection was in support of the provisiontm system, which helps achieve higher yields at advanced nodes by detecting the most challenging defects and monitoring process marginality. applied also invested in materials engineering solutions to improve transistor performance by lowering the contact resistance between the transistor and interconnect wiring. in display and adjacent markets, rd&e investments were focused on expanding the company's market opportunity with a new high-resolution inline e-beam review system and forthcoming solutions to improve oled and flexible display manufacturing.
rd&e expenses increased in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year and also in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, reflecting the impact of ongoing investments in product development initiatives. as part of its growth strategy, applied continued to reprioritize existing spend, to enable increased funding for investments in technical capabilities and critical rd&e programs in current and new markets, with a focus on semiconductor technologies. rd&e expense during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 included $76 million, $69 million and $66 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.

applied's effective tax rates for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were 14.5%, 13.8% and 26.0%, respectively. the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was higher than fiscal 2015 primarily due to resolutions and changes related to income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by changes in the geographical composition of income.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was lower than the rate for fiscal 2014 primarily due to acquisition costs that became deductible in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 as a result of the termination of the proposed business combination with tel, an adjustment in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 to correct an error in the recognition of cost of sales in the u.s. related to intercompany sales as discussed below, reinstatement of the u.s. federal research and development tax credit during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 which was retroactive to its expiration in december 2013, resolutions and changes related to income tax liabilities for prior years, and changes in the geographical composition of income.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 included the effect of an adjustment primarily to correct an error in the recognition of cost of sales in the u.s. related to intercompany sales. while this error had no impact on applied's consolidated cost of sales, it resulted in overstating profitability in the u.s. and the provision for income taxes, income taxes payable and other tax balance sheet accounts in each year since fiscal 2010. the impact of the adjustment to fiscal 2015 was a decrease in provision for income taxes of $28 million which was determined to be immaterial on the originating periods and fiscal 2015. accordingly, a restatement was not considered necessary.

there was no single region that accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the applied global services segment for any of the past three fiscal years.
37
new orders and net sales for fiscal 2016 slightly increased compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher demand and spending on spares and services, partially offset by lower investments in 200mm equipment systems. operating income, non-gaap adjusted operating income, operating margin and non-gaap adjusted operating margin for fiscal 2016 increased compared to fiscal 2015, reflecting higher net sales partially offset by increased headcount to support business growth. one customer accounted for approximately 15 percent of this segment's new orders for fiscal 2016. two customers accounted for approximately 23 percent of this segment's net sales for fiscal 2016, each of whom represented at least 10 percent of this segment's net sales.
new orders and net sales for fiscal 2015 increased compared to fiscal 2014 mainly due to higher demand for semiconductor spares and services, and 200mm equipment systems. operating income, operating margin, non-gaap adjusted operating income, and non-gaap adjusted operating margin increased in fiscal 2015 compared fiscal 2014, reflecting the increase in net sales, which was partially offset by unfavorable product mix and the absence of a recovery of a regional customs duty assessment charge recorded in fiscal 2014.
display and adjacent markets segment the display and adjacent markets segment encompasses products for manufacturing liquid crystal displays (lcds), organic light-emitting diodes (oleds), upgrades and flexible coating systems and other display technologies for tvs, personal computers (pcs), tablets, smart phones and other consumer-oriented devices. the segment is focused on expanding its presence through technologically-differentiated equipment for manufacturing large-scale tvs; emerging markets such as oled, low temperature polysilicon (ltps), metal oxide, and touch panel sectors; and development of products that provide customers with improved performance and yields. display and adjacent markets industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs as well as larger and higher resolution displays for next generation mobile devices, including oled.

in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, customers in china accounted for 37 percent, 66 percent and 69 percent, respectively, of the display and adjacent markets segment's total net sales. customers in korea accounted for 41 percent, 17 percent and 17 percent of total net sales for the display and adjacent markets segment in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the decrease in net sales from customers in china reflected lower customer investments in tv manufacturing equipment, while the increase in net sales from customers in korea related to investments in mobile display manufacturing equipment.
38
new orders for fiscal 2016 increased compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to increased orders for mobile display manufacturing equipment, reflecting increased demand for new technology, and tv manufacturing equipment. net sales for fiscal 2016 increased compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher customer investments in mobile display manufacturing equipment, partially offset by lower customer spending in tv manufacturing equipment. operating income and non-gaap adjusted operating income increased while operating margin and non-gaap adjusted operating margin remained essentially flat or decreased slightly for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, reflecting unfavorable product mix and higher research and new product development costs. two customers accounted for approximately 63 percent of new orders for the display and adjacent markets segment in fiscal 2016, with one customer accounting for approximately 36 percent of new orders. two customers accounted for approximately 55 percent of net sales for this segment in fiscal 2016, with one customer accounting for approximately 44 percent of net sales.
new orders for fiscal 2015 decreased compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to lower tv manufacturing equipment orders, while net sales for fiscal 2015 were higher due to the timing of shipments. operating income and non-gaap adjusted operating income increased for fiscal 2015 from fiscal 2014, reflecting higher net sales. operating margin and non-gaap adjusted operating margin decreased, despite the increase in net sales, primarily due to unfavorable product mix, increased research and development expenses and the sale of tools in fiscal 2014 for which inventory had been previously fully reserved. four customers accounted for approximately 65 percent of new orders for the display and adjacent markets segment in fiscal 2015, with two customers accounting for approximately 37 percent of new orders. four customers accounted for approximately 79 percent of net sales for this segment in fiscal 2015, with two customers accounting for approximately 46 percent of net sales.

cash provided by (used in) financing activities   $(3,432     )            $913           $(348       )
operating activities cash from operating activities for fiscal 2016 was $2.5 billion, which reflects net income adjusted for the effect of non-cash charges and changes in working capital components. non-cash charges included depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation and deferred income taxes. the primary drivers of the increase in cash from operating activities from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 included higher net income and increases in customer deposits, deferred revenue, accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by higher increases in accounts receivable. the primary drivers of the decrease in cash from operating activities from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 were the increases in inventories and deferred income taxes and decreases in accounts payable, accrued expenses, customer deposits, deferred revenue and income taxes payable, partially offset by higher net income.
applied has agreements with various financial institutions to sell accounts receivable and discount promissory notes from selected customers. applied sells its accounts receivable without recourse. applied, from time to time, also discounts letters of credit issued by customers through various financial institutions. the discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements. applied sold $75 million and $45 million of accounts receivable during fiscal 2016 and 2014, respectively. applied did not sell accounts receivable during fiscal 2015. applied did not discount promissory notes or utilize programs to discount letters of credit issued by customers during fiscal 2016 or 2015. applied discounted $29 million letters of credit issued by customers during fiscal 2014.
applied's working capital was $4.7 billion at october 30, 2016 and $5.5 billion at october 25, 2015. applied's working capital at october 30, 2016 includes the effects of the adoption of the authoritative guidance requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted.
days sales, inventory and payable outstanding at the end of each of the periods indicated were:
2016                                 2015      2014
days sales outstanding       63        67        67
days inventory outstanding   98       118       109
days payable outstanding     39        42        43
days sales outstanding varies due to the timing of shipments and payment terms. days sales outstanding decreased at the end of fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher revenue and sale of accounts receivable, and remained flat at the end of fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. the decrease in days inventory outstanding during the current year compared to prior year reflected increased business volume, offset by higher inventory balances at the end of fiscal 2016. days inventory outstanding increased at the end of fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 reflecting higher inventory near the end of the period due to increase in deferred inventory and more builds as compared to revenue turns. days payable outstanding decreased slightly during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 reflecting higher total cost of products sold due to higher business volume, and remained relatively flat in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014.
40
investing activities applied used $425 million, $281 million, and $161 million of cash in investing activities in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. capital expenditures in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $253 million, $215 million and $241 million, respectively. capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 and 2015 were primarily for demonstration and test equipment and laboratory tools in north america. capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 were primarily for demonstration and test equipment and infrastructure improvements in north america, including creation of a new pilot operation facility and distribution center. purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments was $156 million and $62 million for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases of investments totaled $67 million in fiscal 2014. investing activities also included investments in technology to allow applied to access new market opportunities or emerging technologies.
applied's investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade money market mutual funds, u.s. treasury and agency securities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, as well as equity securities. applied regularly monitors the credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures, which may include the sale of certain securities, to manage such risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies.
financing activities applied used $3.4 billion of cash in financing activities in fiscal 2016, consisting primarily of $1.2 billion in debt repayments, $1.9 billion in repurchases of its common stock, and $444 million in cash dividends to stockholders, offset by excess tax benefits from share-based compensation of $23 million and proceeds from common stock issuances of $88 million.
applied generated $913 million of cash from financing activities in fiscal 2015, consisting primarily of net proceeds received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes of $1.8 billion and short-term borrowings of $800 million, offset by cash used for repurchases of its common stock of $1.3 billion and payment of cash dividends of $487 million. applied used $348 million of cash in financing activities in fiscal 2014, which included payment of cash dividends to stockholders and issuances of common stock. applied made no repurchases of its common stock in fiscal 2014. on june 9, 2016, applied's board of directors approved a new common stock repurchase program authorizing up to $2.0 billion in repurchases which followed the completion of a $3.0 billion common stock repurchase program approved on april 26, 2015. at october 30, 2016, $1.8 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this repurchase program. proceeds from stock issuances under equity compensation awards and related excess tax benefits in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $111 million, $144 million and $137 million, respectively.
during each of fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, applied's board of directors declared quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.10 per share. applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on applied's financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination by the board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of applied's stockholders.
applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to $1.6 billion, of which $1.5 billion is comprised of a committed revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in september 2020. this agreement provides for borrowings in united states dollars at interest rates keyed to one of two rates selected by applied for each advance and includes financial and other covenants with which applied was in compliance at october 30, 2016. remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately $77 million are with japanese banks. applied's ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks' prime reference rate denominated in japanese yen. no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities at both october 30, 2016 and october 25, 2015, and applied has not utilized these credit facilities.
in fiscal 2011, applied established a short-term commercial paper program of up to $1.5 billion. at october 30, 2016 and october 25, 2015, applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding, but may issue commercial paper notes under this program from time to time in the future.
applied had senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $3.4 billion outstanding as of october 30, 2016. the indentures governing these notes include covenants with which applied was in compliance at october 30, 2016. in november 2015, applied completed the redemption of the entire outstanding $400 million in principal amount of senior notes due in 2016. the redemption price was $405 million, and after adjusting for the carrying value of the debt issuance costs and discounts, applied recorded a $5 million loss on the prepayment of the $400 million debt, which is included in non-operating loss in the consolidated statement of operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. see note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of existing debt. applied may seek to refinance its existing debt and may incur additional indebtedness depending on applied's capital requirements and the availability of financing.
41
others during fiscal 2016, applied recorded a bad debt provision of $3 million, and released $9 million and $16 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively, of its allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of an overall lower risk profile of applied's customers. while applied believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts at october 30, 2016 is adequate, it will continue to closely monitor customer liquidity and economic conditions.
as of october 30, 2016, approximately $4.0 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries may be subject to u.s. income taxes if repatriated for u.s. operations. applied intends to indefinitely reinvest approximately $3.3 billion of these funds outside of the u.s. and does not plan to repatriate these funds. applied would need to accrue and pay u.s. taxes if these funds were repatriated. for the remaining cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries, u.s. income taxes have been provided for in the financial statements. subsequent to october 30, 2016, a foreign subsidiary of applied made an advance payment of $1.8 billion to applied. applied's provision for income taxes and effective tax rate will not be materially affected by this transaction.
although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above, applied's management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy applied's liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. for further details regarding applied's operating, investing and financing activities, see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report.
for details on standby letters of credit and other agreements with banks, see off-balance sheet arrangements below.

off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either applied or its subsidiaries. as of october 30, 2016, the maximum potential amount of future payments that applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately $52 million. applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. applied does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements.
applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of credit. as of october 30, 2016, applied materials inc. has provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately $100 million to cover these arrangements.

1   represents applied's agreements to purchase goods and services consisting of applied's outstanding purchase orders for goods and services.
2   other long-term liabilities in the table do not include pension, post-retirement and deferred compensation plans due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments. applied evaluates the need to make contributions to its pension and post-retirement benefit plans after considering the funded status of the plans, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. payments to the plans would be dependent on these factors and could vary across a wide range of amounts and time periods. payments for deferred compensation plans are dependent on activity by participants, making the timing of payments uncertain. information on applied's pension, post-retirement benefit and deferred compensation plans is presented in note 11, employee benefit plans, of the consolidated financial statements.
3   applied's other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets include deferred tax liabilities, gross unrecognized tax benefits and related gross interest and penalties. as of october 30, 2016, the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits that was not expected to result in payment of cash within one year was $320 million. interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions that were not expected to result in payment of cash within one year of october 30, 2016 and october 25, 2015 were $33 million and $14 million, respectively. at this time, applied is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies.
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied's consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied's financial condition or results of operations. specifically, these policies have the following attributes: (1) applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and (2) different estimates applied could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on applied's financial condition or results of operations.
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as applied's operating environment changes. these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known. in addition, management is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time. these uncertainties include those discussed in part i, item 1a, "risk factors." based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that applied's consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, and provide a meaningful presentation of applied's financial condition and results of operations.
management believes that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates:
revenue recognition applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is probable. each sale arrangement may contain commercial terms that differ from other arrangements. in addition, applied frequently enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables. judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. moreover, judgment is used in interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period. while changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on applied's financial condition and results of operations.
warranty costs applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized. estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product, current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs. applied's warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period. as applied's customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally, labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs. the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs. unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs. if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied's estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
allowance for doubtful accounts applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. this allowance is based on historical experience, credit evaluations, specific customer collection history and any customer-specific issues applied has identified. changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer's ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends, may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
44
inventory valuation inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand. applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand. in addition, inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated, additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
goodwill and intangible assets applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment. intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value.
to test goodwill for impairment, applied first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. if it is concluded that this is the case, applied then performs the two-step goodwill impairment test. otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. under the two-step goodwill impairment test, applied would in the first step compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, applied would then perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. if applied determines that the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, applied would record an impairment charge equal to the difference.
applied determines the fair value of each reporting unit based on a weighting of an income and a market approach. applied bases the fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. under the income approach, applied estimates the fair value based on discounted cash flow method.
the estimates used in the impairment testing are consistent with the discrete forecasts that applied uses to manage its business, and considers any significant developments during the period. under the discounted cash flow method, cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts are estimated using a terminal growth rate, which considers the long-term earnings growth rate specific to the reporting units. the estimated future cash flows are discounted to present value using each reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital. the weighted average cost of capital measures a reporting unit's cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and equity in a reporting unit's target capital structure. in addition, the weighted average cost of capital is derived using both known and estimated market metrics, and is adjusted to reflect both the timing and risks associated with the estimated cash flows. the tax rate used in the discounted cash flow method is the median tax rate of comparable companies and reflects applied's current international structure, which is consistent with the market participant perspective. under the market approach, applied uses the guideline company method which applies market multiples to forecasted revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. applied uses market multiples that are consistent with comparable publicly-traded companies and considers each reporting unit's size, growth and profitability relative to its comparable companies.
management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment, especially in emerging markets. indicators of potential impairment include, but are not limited to, challenging economic conditions, an unfavorable industry or economic environment or other severe decline in market conditions. such conditions could have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates used for the fair value calculation, resulting in an unexpected goodwill impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations. see note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of goodwill impairment.
45
income taxes applied's provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are affected by the geographical composition of pre-tax income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates, conditional reduced tax rates and other income tax incentives. it is also affected by events that are not consistent from period to period, such as changes to income tax laws and the resolution of prior years' income tax filings.
applied recognizes a current tax liability for the estimated amount of income tax payable on tax returns for the current fiscal year. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets are also recognized for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance to the extent it is more likely than not that they are not expected to be realized.
applied recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized from such positions are estimated based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. any changes in judgment related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the quarter in which such change occurs. interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in applied's provision for income taxes.
the calculation of applied's provision for income taxes and effective tax rate involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied's expectations could have an adverse material impact on applied's results of operations and financial condition.
non-gaap adjusted financial results applied provides investors with certain non-gaap adjusted financial measures, which are adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses, including certain items related to mergers and acquisitions; restructuring charges and any associated adjustments; impairments of assets, or investments; gain or loss on sale of strategic investments; certain other discrete adjustments and income tax items. reconciliations of these non-gaap measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap are provided in the financial tables presented below.
management uses these non-gaap adjusted financial measures to evaluate the company's operating and financial performance and for planning purposes, and as performance measures in its executive compensation program. applied believes these measures enhance an overall understanding of our performance and investors' ability to review the company's business from the same perspective as the company's management and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance. there are limitations in using non-gaap financial measures because the non-gaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies, and may exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap.

1   amounts for fiscal 2016 and 2015 included resolution of prior years' income tax filings and other tax items. amounts for fiscal 2015 included an adjustment to decrease the provision for income taxes by $28 million with a corresponding increase in net income, resulting in an increase in diluted earnings per share of $0.02. the adjustment was excluded in applied's non-gaap adjusted results and was made primarily to correct an error in the recognition of cost of sales in the u.s. related to intercompany sales, which resulted in overstating profitability in the u.s. and the provision for income taxes in immaterial amounts in each year since fiscal 2010.

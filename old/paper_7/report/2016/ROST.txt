item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ross stores, inc. operates two brands of off-price retail apparel and home fashion stores-ross dress for less® ("ross") and dd's discounts®. ross is the largest off-price apparel and home fashion chain in the united states with 1,340 locations in 36 states, the district of columbia and guam as of january 28, 2017. ross offers first-quality, in-season, name brand and designer apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 60% off department and specialty store regular prices every day. we also operate 193 dd's discounts stores in 15 states as of january 28, 2017 that feature a more moderately-priced assortment of first-quality, in-season, name brand apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 70% off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day.
our primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing off-price strategies to maintain and improve both profitability and financial returns over the long term. in establishing appropriate growth targets for our business, we closely monitor market share trends for the off-price industry and believe our share gains over the past few years were driven mainly by continued focus on value by consumers. our sales and earnings gains in 2016 continued to benefit from efficient execution of our off-price model throughout all areas of our business. our merchandise and operational strategies are designed to take advantage of the expanding market share of the off-price industry as well as the ongoing customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and home at compelling discounts every day.
we refer to our fiscal years ended january 28, 2017, january 30, 2016, and january 31, 2015 as fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015, and fiscal 2014, respectively.
all share and per share amounts have been adjusted for the two-for-one stock split effective june 11, 2015.

stores. total stores open at the end of fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 were 1,533, 1,446, and 1,362, respectively. the number of stores at the end of fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 increased by 6%, 6%, and 7% from the respective prior years. our expansion strategy is to open additional stores based on market penetration, local demographic characteristics, competition, expected store profitability, and the ability to leverage overhead expenses. we continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations. we also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria.

sales. sales for fiscal 2016 increased $0.9 billion, or 7.8%, compared to the prior year due to the opening of 87 net new stores during 2016 and a 4% increase in comparable store sales (defined as stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months). sales for fiscal 2015 increased $0.9 billion, or 8.1%, compared to the prior year due to the opening of 84 net new stores during 2015 and a 4% increase in sales from comparable stores.

we intend to address the competitive climate for off-price apparel and home goods by pursuing and refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our organization, diversify our merchandise mix, and more fully develop our systems to improve regional and local merchandise offerings. although our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, we cannot be sure that they will result in a continuation of sales growth or in an increase in net earnings.
cost of goods sold. cost of goods sold in fiscal 2016 increased $596.8 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 87 net new stores during the year and a 4% increase in sales from comparable stores.
cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2016 decreased approximately 55 basis points from the prior year primarily due to a 35 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin, a 10 basis point decrease in buying expenses, and lower distribution and occupancy costs by five basis points each.
cost of goods sold in fiscal 2015 increased $638.9 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 84 net new stores during the year and a 4% increase in sales from comparable stores.
cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2015 decreased approximately five basis points from the prior year primarily due to a 45 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin and five basis points of occupancy leverage. this improvement was partially offset by a 35 basis point increase in distribution expenses related to infrastructure investments and higher freight costs of 10 basis points.
22
we cannot be sure that the gross profit margins realized in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 will continue in future years.
selling, general and administrative expenses. for fiscal 2016, selling, general and administrative expenses ("sg&a") increased $151.7 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 87 net new stores during the year. sg&a as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2016 increased by approximately 15 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to higher wages.
for fiscal 2015, sg&a increased $123.4 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 84 net new stores and the impact of wage rate increases during the year. sg&a as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2015 decreased by approximately five basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to leverage resulting from the 4% increase in comparable store sales.
interest expense (income), net. in fiscal 2016, net interest expense increased by $3.9 million primarily due to a reduction of capitalized interest partially offset by an increase in interest income. as a percentage of sales, net interest expense in fiscal 2016 remained flat compared to the prior year. the table below shows the components of interest expense and income for fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014:
($000)                               2016                2015                2014
interest expense on long-term debt         $18,573             $18,568             $12,990
other interest expense                       1,022               1,252               1,230
capitalized interest                           (26   )          (6,530   )         (10,825   )
interest income                             (3,081   )            (678   )            (411   )
interest expense, net                      $16,488             $12,612              $2,984
taxes on earnings. our effective tax rates for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were approximately 37%, 37% and 38%, respectively. the effective tax rate represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns. the effective rate is impacted by changes in laws, location of new stores, level of earnings, and the resolution of tax positions with various taxing authorities. we anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 will be between 37% and 38%.
net earnings. net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2016 were higher than fiscal 2015 primarily due to lower cost of goods sold partially offset by higher sg&a expenses. net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2015 were higher compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to both lower cost of goods sold and lower sg&a expenses.
earnings per share. diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2016 was $2.83 compared to $2.51 in the prior year. the 13% increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an increase of approximately 10% in net earnings and a 3% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding, largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program. diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2015 was $2.51 compared to $2.21 in fiscal 2014. the 14% increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an increase of approximately 10% in net earnings and a 4% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding, largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program.
financial condition liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds for our business activities are cash flows from operations and short-term trade credit. our primary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory purchases, payroll, rent, taxes, and capital expenditures in connection with new and existing stores, and investments in distribution centers, information systems, and buying and corporate offices. we also use cash to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to pay dividends.

net increase in cash and cash equivalents        $350.0                 $65.0                $273.4
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $1,558.9 million, $1,326.2 million, and $1,372.8 million in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, and was primarily driven by net earnings excluding non-cash expenses for depreciation and amortization. our primary source of operating cash flow is the sale of our merchandise inventory. we regularly review the age and condition of our merchandise and are able to maintain current merchandise inventory in our stores through replenishment processes and liquidation of slower-moving merchandise through clearance markdowns.
the increase in cash flow from operating activities in 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily driven by higher earnings, the timing of receipts and related payments versus last year, and by higher income taxes payable. the timing of merchandise receipts and related payments versus last year resulted in higher accounts payable leverage (defined as accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory) which was 68%, 67%, and 73% as of january 28, 2017, january 30, 2016, and january 31, 2015, respectively.
the decrease in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily driven by the timing of merchandise receipts and related payments versus last year, partially offset by higher earnings.
as a regular part of our business, packaway inventory levels will vary over time based on availability of compelling opportunities in the marketplace. packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date. the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation to our store merchandise assortment plans. as such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase, but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months. we expect to continue to take advantage of packaway inventory opportunities to maximize our ability to deliver bargains to our customers.
changes in packaway inventory levels impact our operating cash flow. at the end of fiscal 2016, packaway inventory was 49% of total inventory compared to 47% and 45% at the end of fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $292.8 million, $362.5 million, and $639.0 million in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. the decrease in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 was primarily due to a reduction in our capital expenditures.
in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, our capital expenditures were $297.9 million, $367.0 million, and $646.7 million, respectively. our capital expenditures include costs to build, expand, and improve distribution centers, open new stores and improve existing stores, and for various other expenditures related to our information technology systems, buying, and corporate offices. the decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the completion in 2015 of the rollout of new point of sale equipment in our stores and construction of a distribution center. the decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the purchase in september 2014 of our new york buying office and the construction of two distribution centers. we opened 93, 90, and 95 new stores in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

our capital expenditures over the last three years are set forth in the table below:

total capital expenditures                         $297.9          $367.0          $646.7
we are forecasting approximately $400 million in capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 to fund costs for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open new ross and dd's discounts stores, the upgrade or relocation of existing stores, investments in information technology systems, and for various other expenditures related to our stores, distribution centers, buying and corporate offices. we expect to fund capital expenditures with available cash and cash flows from operations.
we had no purchases of investments in fiscal 2016 and 2014 and $0.7 million of purchases of investments in fiscal 2015. we had proceeds from investments of $1.7 million, $1.1 million, and $12.0 million in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was $916.1 million, $898.7 million, and $460.4 million in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. during fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash flows from operations and in fiscal 2014, the issuance of our unsecured 3.375% senior notes due september 2024 ("2024 notes").
in september 2014, we issued $250 million of unsecured 2024 notes and used most of the net proceeds of approximately $246 million to purchase our new york buying office building for $222 million and the remaining $24 million for other general corporate purposes.
we repurchased 11.6 million, 13.7 million, and 14.8 million shares of common stock for aggregate purchase prices of approximately $700 million, $700 million, and $550 million in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. we also acquired 0.7 million, 1.3 million, and 1.1 million shares in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, of treasury stock from our employee stock equity compensation programs, for aggregate purchase prices of approximately $43.3 million, $68.9 million, and $39.0 million during fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
in february 2017, our board of directors approved a new, two-year $1.75 billion stock repurchase program through fiscal 2018.
on february 28, 2017, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.1600 per common share, payable on march 31, 2017. our board of directors declared cash dividends of $0.1350 per common share in march, may, august, and november 2016, cash dividends of $0.1175 per common share in february, may, august, and november 2015, and cash dividends of $0.1000 per common share in february, may, august, and november 2014.
during fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, we paid dividends of $214.6 million, $192.3 million, and $168.5 million, respectively.
short-term trade credit represents a significant source of financing for merchandise inventory. trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors. we regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from all sources and expect to be able to maintain adequate trade credit, bank lines, and other credit sources to meet our capital and liquidity requirements, including lease payment obligations, in 2017.
in april 2016, we entered into a new $600 million unsecured revolving credit facility. this credit facility, which replaced our previous $600 million unsecured revolving credit facility, expires in april 2021 and contains a $300 million sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit (subject to increase in proportion to any increase in the size of the credit facility). the facility also contains an option allowing us to increase the size of our revolving credit facility by up to an additional $200 million, with the agreement of the lenders. interest on any borrowings under this facility is based on libor plus
25
an applicable margin (currently 100 basis points) and is payable quarterly and upon maturity. the revolving credit facility may be extended, at our option, for up to two additional one year periods, subject to customary conditions. as of january 28, 2017, we had no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding on this facility and our $600 million credit facility remains in place and available.
the revolving credit facility is subject to a financial leverage ratio covenant. as of january 28, 2017, we were in compliance with this covenant.
we estimate that existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, bank credit lines, and trade credit are adequate to meet our operating cash needs and to fund our planned capital investments, common stock repurchases, and quarterly dividend payments for at least the next twelve months.
contractual obligations the table below presents our significant contractual obligations as of january 28, 2017:

the 2024 notes, series a, and series b senior notes are all subject to prepayment penalties for early payment of principal.
off-balance sheet arrangements operating leases. we currently lease all but three of our store locations, three warehouse facilities, and a buying office. in addition, we have a ground lease related to our new york buying office. except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment, these leased locations do not represent long-term capital investments.
two of the warehouses are in carlisle, pennsylvania with leases expiring in 2018 and 2019. the third warehouse is in fort mill, south carolina, with a lease expiring in 2019. the leases for the two carlisle, pennsylvania warehouses contain renewal provisions.
we currently lease approximately 87,000 square feet of office space for our los angeles buying office. the lease term for this facility expires in 2017 and contains renewal provisions.
26
purchase obligations. as of january 28, 2017 we had purchase obligations of approximately $2,146 million. these purchase obligations primarily consist of merchandise inventory purchase orders, commitments related to construction projects, store fixtures and supplies, and information technology service, transportation, and maintenance contracts.
standby letters of credit and collateral trust. we use standby letters of credit outside of our revolving credit facility in addition to a funded trust to collateralize our insurance obligations. as of january 28, 2017 and january 30, 2016, we had $11.6 million and $15.3 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit outstanding and $56.6 million and $56.4 million, respectively, in a collateral trust. the standby letters of credit are collateralized by restricted cash and the collateral trust consists of restricted cash, cash equivalents, and investments.
trade letters of credit. we had $26.5 million and $32.0 million in trade letters of credit outstanding at january 28, 2017 and january 30, 2016, respectively.
effects of inflation or deflation. we do not consider the effects of inflation or deflation to be material to our financial position and results of operations.
other critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable. we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies.
in many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), with no need for management's judgment in their application. there are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle over another would not produce a materially different result. see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under item 8 in this annual report on form 10-k, which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap.
merchandise inventory. our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost (determined using a weighted average basis) or net realizable value. we purchase inventory that can either be shipped to stores or processed as packaway merchandise with the intent that it will be warehoused and released to stores at a later date. the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation to the company's store merchandise assortment plans. as such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase, but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months. packaway inventory accounted for approximately 49%, 47%, and 45% of total inventories as of january 28, 2017, january 30, 2016, and january 31, 2015, respectively. merchandise inventory includes acquisition, processing, and storage costs related to packaway inventory.
included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage. the shortage reserve is based on historical shortage rates as evaluated through our annual physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts. if actual market conditions, markdowns, or shortage are less favorable than those projected by us, or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated, additional merchandise inventory write-downs may be required.
long-lived assets. we review for a long-lived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows. if analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group, an impairment loss would be recognized to write the asset group down to its fair value. if our actual results differ materially from projected results, an impairment charge may be required in the future. in the course of performing our annual analysis, we determined that no long-lived asset impairment charge was required for fiscal 2016, 2015, or 2014.
depreciation and amortization expense. property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, typically ranging from three to 12 years for equipment and information systems and 20 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings. the cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term.
27
lease accounting. when a lease contains "rent holidays" or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments, we record rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent. we begin recording rent expense on the lease possession date. tenant improvement allowances are included in other long-term liabilities and are amortized over the lease term. changes in tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. see recently issued accounting standards below.
insurance obligations. we use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risk management activities, including workers' compensation, general liability, and employee-related health care benefits. our self-insurance and deductible liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required.
stock-based compensation. we recognize compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of all stock-based awards. we use historical data to estimate pre-vesting forfeitures and to recognize stock-based compensation expense. all stock-based compensation awards are expensed over the service and performance periods of the awards.
income taxes. we account for our uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting standards codification ("asc") 740. we are required to make assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures. our policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to all tax positions in income tax expense. to the extent that accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable, amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is made.
recently issued accounting standards. in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update (asu) 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606). the guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. the core principle of the guidance is that a company should recognize revenue when the customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. asu 2014-09 is effective for our annual and interim reporting periods beginning in fiscal 2018. we do not expect the adoption of this new guidance to be material to our consolidated financial statements.
in february 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-02, leases (topic 842). the asu requires balance sheet recognition for all leases with lease terms greater than one year including a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. asu 2016-02 is effective for our annual and interim reporting periods beginning in fiscal 2019. we are currently evaluating the effect adoption of this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. due to the substantial number of leases that we have, we believe this asu will increase assets and liabilities by the same material amount on our consolidated balance sheet. see note e for disclosure of our current undiscounted minimum commitments under noncancelable operating leases. we do not believe adoption of this asu will have a significant impact to our consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity, and cash flows.
in march 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-09, compensation - stock compensation (topic 718) - improvements to employee share-based payment accounting. asu 2016-09 provides for changes to accounting for stock compensation including 1) excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share based payment awards will be recognized as income tax benefit or expense in the reporting period in which they occur (previously such amounts were recognized in additional paid-in capital); 2) excess tax benefits will be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows; and 3) the option to elect to estimate forfeitures or account for them when they occur. asu 2016-09 is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2017. upon adoption of asu 2016-09, we plan to account for forfeitures as incurred and expect this adoption along with the retrospective impact on our classification of cash flows between operating and financing activities to be immaterial. we believe the impact of recording excess tax benefits in income taxes in our consolidated statement of earnings may be material. the magnitude of such impact is dependent upon our future stock price in relation to the fair value of awards on grant date and our future grants of stock-based compensation. see note f for disclosure of our historical accounting treatment of excess tax benefits.
in november 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-18, statement of cash flows (topic 230): restricted cash. asu 2016-18 requires restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the total beginning and ending amounts on the statement of cash flows. the standard also requires
28
companies who report cash and restricted cash separately on the balance sheet to reconcile those amounts to the statement of cash flows. asu 2016-18 is effective for our annual and interim reporting periods beginning in fiscal 2018. we do not believe adoption of this asu will have a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements.
forward-looking statements our annual report on form 10-k for fiscal 2016, and information we provide in our annual report to stockholders, press releases, and other investor communications including those on our corporate website, may contain a number of forward-looking statements regarding, without limitation, planned store growth, new markets, expected sales, projected earnings levels, capital expenditures, and other matters. these forward-looking statements reflect our then current beliefs, projections, and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance, operations, and competitive position. the words "plan," "expect," "target," "anticipate," "estimate," "believe," "forecast," "projected," "guidance," "looking ahead" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.
future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue, profitability, and growth remain difficult to predict. our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements and our previous expectations and projections. refer to item 1a in this annual report on form 10-k for a more complete discussion of risk factors for ross and dd's discounts. the factors underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to change. as a result, any forecasts or forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time. we disclaim any obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.

forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k, including this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, contains statements that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. all statements that do not concern historical facts are forward-looking statements and include, among other things, statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions and/or strategies for the future. these forward-looking statements include statements regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, including the expected impact of the policy change for medicaid patients seeking affordable care act (aca) plans, including on our future operating income and other impacts of this policy change, expectations for treatment growth rates, revenue per treatment, expense growth, levels of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, operating income, cash flow, operating cash flow, estimated tax rates, estimated charges and accruals, capital expenditures, the development of new dialysis centers and dialysis center acquisitions, government and commercial payment rates, revenue estimating risk and the impact of our level of indebtedness on our financial performance, and including earnings per share. these statements involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, including risks resulting from the concentration of profits generated by higher-paying commercial payor plans for which there is continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates, and a reduction in the number of patients under such plans, which may result in the loss of revenues or patients, and the extent to which the ongoing implementation of healthcare exchanges or changes in regulations or enforcement of regulations regarding the exchanges results in a reduction in reimbursement rates for our services from and/or the number of patients enrolled in higher-paying commercial plans, a reduction in government payment rates under the medicare esrd program or other government-based programs, the impact of the cms medicare advantage benchmark structure, risks arising from potential federal and/or state legislation that could have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability, the impact of the 2016 congressional and presidential elections on the current health care marketplace and on our business, including with respect to the future of the aca, the exchanges, and many other core aspects of the current health care marketplace, changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies, or pharmaceutical pricing, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and the provisions of our current corporate integrity agreement (cia), and current or potential investigations by various government entities and related government or private-party proceedings, the restrictions on our business and operations required by the cia and other settlement terms, and the financial impact thereof, continued increased competition from large- and medium-sized dialysis providers that compete directly with us, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, changing affiliation models for physicians, and the emergence of new models of care introduced by the government or private sector that may erode our patient base and reimbursement rates such as accountable care organizations (acos), independent practice associations (ipas) and integrated delivery networks, our ability to complete acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we might be considering or announce, or to integrate and successfully operate any business we may acquire or have acquired, including davita medical group (dmg), or to expand our operations and services to markets outside the u.s., or to businesses outside of dialysis and dmg's business, the variability of our cash flows, the risk that we might invest material amounts of capital and incur significant costs in connection with the growth and development of our international operations, yet we might not be able to operate them profitably anytime soon, if at all, risks arising from the use of accounting estimates, judgments and interpretations in our financial statements, the risk that laws regulating the corporate practice of medicine could restrict the manner in which dmg conducts its business, the risk that the cost of providing services under dmg's agreements may exceed our compensation, the risk that reductions in reimbursement rates, including medicare advantage rates, and future regulations may negatively impact dmg's business, revenue and profitability, the risk that dmg may not be able to successfully establish a presence in new geographic regions or successfully address competitive threats that could reduce its profitability, the risk that a disruption in dmg's healthcare provider networks could have an adverse effect on dmg's business operations and profitability, the risk that reductions in the quality ratings of health maintenance organization plan customers of dmg could have an adverse effect on dmg's business, or the risk that health plans that acquire health maintenance organizations may not be willing to contract with dmg or may be willing to contract only on less favorable terms, and the other risk factors set forth in part ii, item 1a. of this annual report on form 10-k. we base our forward-looking statements on information currently available to us at the time of this annual report on form 10-k, and except as required by law we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise.
the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and "item 1. business".

company overview the company consists of two major divisions, davita kidney care (kidney care) and davita medical group (dmg). kidney care is comprised of our u.s. dialysis and related lab services, our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including our international operations, and our corporate administrative support. our u.s. dialysis and related lab services business is our largest line of business, which is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services in the u.s. for patients suffering from chronic kidney failure, also known as end stage renal disease (esrd). dmg is a patient- and physician-focused integrated healthcare delivery and management company with over two decades of providing coordinated, outcomes-based medical care in a cost-effective manner.
our overall financial performance for 2016 in u.s. dialysis and related lab services benefited from increased treatment volume, primarily from non-acquired growth at existing and new dialysis centers, cost control initiatives, and payor mix improvements in our dialysis business. this was partially offset by an increase in labor costs and other center related costs. dmg experienced a decrease in adjusted operating income primarily due to a reduction in medicare advantage reimbursement rates and an increase in medical costs.
some of our major accomplishments and financial operating performance indicators in 2016 and year over year were as follows:
•   improved clinical outcomes in our u.s. dialysis operations, including third consecutive year as a leader in cms' five -star quality rating system;

•   consolidated net revenue growth of 7.0%;

•   5.7% total net revenue growth in our u.s. dialysis segment, including an increase of $4 per treatment;

•   improved performance in our normalized non-acquired u.s. dialysis treatment growth of 4.2%, which contributed to an increase of approximately 4.5% in the overall number of u.s. dialysis treatments;

•   net increase of 99 u.s. dialysis centers and 36 international dialysis centers;

•   an increase in dmg's net revenue of 7.2% related to an increase in its fee-for-service (ffs) business from the acquisition of the everett clinic medical group (tec);

•   formation of a strategic joint venture in our asia-pacific market;

•   an increase in other ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenue of 17.3%; and

•   strong operating cash flows of $1.963 billion.

we believe that 2017 will be challenging due to the uncertainty around the aca and the ability of our patients to utilize charitable premium assistance, average commercial rate pressure, increases in clinical costs due to inflation, employee turnover and other factors affecting u.s. dialysis and related lab services. in addition, the 2016 presidential and congressional elections have caused the future state of the exchanges and other aca reforms and the healthcare landscape in general to be very unclear. dmg continues to face challenges due to announced decreases in medicare advantage and medicaid reimbursement rates as the government continues to modify the rate structure. we also remain committed to our international expansion plans that will continue to require investment.

(1)   for the year ended december 31, 2016, we have excluded goodwill impairment charges of $253 million related to our dmg reporting units and $28 million related to our vascular access reporting unit, an impairment of $15 million related to a minority equity investment, the loss on sale of our dmg arizona business of $10 million, estimated accruals for damages and liabilities associated with our dmg nevada hospice business of $16 million and our pharmacy business of $16 million, an adjustment to reduce receivables associated with the dmg acquisition escrow provision relating to income tax items of $31 million, the gain on changes in ownership interest upon the formation of the asia pacific joint venture (apac jv) of $374 million and the gain related to the sale of a portion of our tandigm ownership interest of $40 million. for the year ended december 31, 2015, we have excluded estimated goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $210 million primarily related to certain dmg reporting units, an estimated accrual of $22 million for damages and liabilities associated with our pharmacy business, which is included in general and administrative expenses, and $495 million related to a settlement charge in connection with a private civil suit. in addition, for the year ended december 31, 2014, we have excluded $17 million, related to a loss contingency accrual for the settlement of the 2010 and 2011 u.s. attorney physician relationship investigations. these are non-gaap measures and are not intended as substitutes for the equivalent gaap measures. we have presented these adjusted amounts because management believes that these presentations enhance a user's understanding of our normal consolidated operating income by excluding certain items which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results of operations. as a result, adjusting for these amounts allows for comparison to our normal prior period results.

consolidated net revenues consolidated net revenues for 2016 increased by approximately $963 million, or 7.0%, from 2015. this increase in consolidated net revenues was due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $496 million, principally due to solid volume growth from additional treatments from non-acquired growth, one additional treatment day in 2016, and an increase of $4 in the average dialysis revenue per treatment, as discussed below. consolidated net revenues also increased due to an increase in dmg's net revenues of $277 million, primarily due to an increase in ffs revenues from acquisitions and an increase in senior capitated revenues, as described below. in addition, revenue increased by approximately $239 million in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives driven primarily from growth in our pharmacy services and an increase in net revenues from our expansion in our international business and other strategic initiatives.
66
consolidated net revenues for 2015 increased by approximately $987 million, or 7.7%, from 2014. this increase in consolidated net revenues was due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $431 million, principally due to solid volume growth from additional treatments from non-acquired growth and from an increase of $6 in the average dialysis revenue per treatment, primarily from an increase in our average commercial payment rates and improvement in our commercial payor mix. consolidated net revenues also increased by $335 million as a result of dmg's growth from acquisitions and timing of the recognition of additional medicaid risk sharing revenue, as described below. in addition, revenue increased by approximately $243 million in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives driven primarily from growth in our pharmacy services and our disease management services, as well as expansion in our international operations. these increases were partially offset by an increase in reserves for refunds of prior period pharmacy reimbursements.
consolidated operating income consolidated operating income of $1.895 billion for 2016, which includes impairment charges of $296 million, estimated accruals for damages and liabilities associated with our pharmacy and dmg nevada hospice businesses of $32 million, an adjustment to reduce receivables associated with the dmg acquisition escrow provision of $31 million, and the net gain on the apac jv, tandigm and dmg arizona ownership changes of $404 million, increased by approximately $724 million from 2015, which included estimated impairment charges of approximately $210 million, an estimated pharmacy accrual of $22 million and a private litigation settlement charge of $495 million. excluding these items from their respective periods, adjusted consolidated operating income for 2016 would have decreased by $49 million. adjusted consolidated operating income decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in adjusted operating income related to dmg of $105 million, partially offset by an increase in adjusted operating income for the dialysis and related lab services of $22 million and a decrease in adjusted operating losses in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives of $30 million, each discussed in detail below.
consolidated operating income of $1.171 billion for 2015, which included estimated impairment charges of approximately $210 million, an estimated pharmacy accrual of $22 million and a private litigation settlement charge of $495 million, decreased by approximately $644 million from 2014, which included a $17 million loss contingency accrual. excluding these items from their respective periods, adjusted consolidated operating income for 2015 would have increased by $66 million, or 3.6%. adjusted consolidated operating income increased primarily as a result of an increase in adjusted operating income in dialysis and related lab services of $100 million and an increase in adjusted operating income at dmg of $25 million, partially offset by an increase in the amount of adjusted operating losses in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives of $53 million, each discussed in detail below.
u.s. dialysis and related lab services business our u.s. dialysis and related lab services business is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services through a network of 2,350 outpatient dialysis centers which we own and manage through management services agreements, in 46 states and the district of columbia, serving a total of approximately 187,700 patients. we also provide acute inpatient dialysis services in approximately 900 hospitals. we estimate that we have approximately a 36% market share in the u.s. based upon the number of patients that we serve. in 2016, our overall network of u.s. outpatient dialysis centers increased by 99 dialysis centers primarily as a result of opening new dialysis centers and from acquisitions of existing dialysis centers. in addition, the overall number of patients that we serve in the u.s. increased by approximately 4.5% in 2016 as compared to 2015.
our dialysis and related lab services stated mission is to be the provider, partner and employer of choice. we believe our attention to these three stakeholders-our patients, our business partners, and our teammates-represents the major driver of our long-term performance, although we are subject to the impact of several external factors such as government policy, physician practice patterns, commercial payor payment rates and the mix of commercial and government patients. two principal non-financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. we have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the davita quality index (dqi). our clinical outcomes as measured by dqi have improved over each of the past several years which we believe directly decreases patient mortalities. our patient mortality percentages have decreased from 19.0% in 2001 to 13.8% in 2015. for the third consecutive year, we continue to be a leader in the industry under both the cms qip and five-star quality rating systems. over the last two years our clinical teammate turnover has increased slightly, causing productivity to slightly decrease; however, despite this, we have continued to improve our clinical performance. we will continue to focus on these three stakeholders and our clinical outcomes as we believe these are fundamental long-term value drivers.
we believe our national scale, size and commitment to our patients, among other things, allows us to provide industry-leading quality care with superior clinical outcomes that attracts patients, referring physicians, and qualified medical directors to our network, which provides our dialysis patient base with a large number of out-patient dialysis centers to choose from with convenient locations and access to a full range of other integrated services which provides us the ability to effectively and efficiently manage a patient's care and certain costs while still maintaining strong legal and compliance programs.

the following graph summarizes our dialysis services revenues by modality for the year ended december 31, 2016:
outpatient hemodialysis 79%, peritoneal dialysis and home-based hemodialysis 16%, hospital inpatient hemodialysis 5%
approximately 62% of our 2016 consolidated net revenues were derived directly from our dialysis and related lab services business. approximately 79% of our 2016 dialysis and related lab services revenues were derived from outpatient hemodialysis services in the 2,316 u.s. dialysis centers that we consolidate. other dialysis services, which are operationally integrated with our dialysis operations, are peritoneal dialysis, home-based hemodialysis, hospital inpatient hemodialysis services and management and administrative services provided to dialysis centers in which we own a noncontrolling interest or which are wholly owned by third parties. these services collectively accounted for the balance of our 2016 dialysis and related lab services revenues.
the principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are:
•   the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring approximately three treatments per week as well as, to a lesser extent, the number of treatments for peritoneal dialysis services and home-based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis services; and

•   average dialysis revenue per treatment, including the mix of commercial and government patients.

the total patient base is a relatively stable factor, which we believe is influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis services as indicated by the united states renal data system which reported an approximate compound growth rate of 3.8% from 2000 to 2014 for the dialysis patient population, our relationships with referring physicians, together with the quality of our clinical care which can lead to reduced patient mortality rates as indicated above, and our ability to open and acquire new dialysis centers.
our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment is driven by changes in our mix of commercial and government (principally medicare and medicaid) patients, commercial and government payment rates, and our billing and collecting operations performance.
on average, dialysis-related payment rates from contracted commercial payors are significantly higher than medicare, medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients in relation to total patients represents a major driver of our total average dialysis revenue per treatment. the percentage of commercial patients covered under contracted plans as compared to commercial patients with out-of-network providers continued to increase, which can significantly affect our average dialysis revenue per treatment since commercial payment rates for patients with out-of-network providers are on average higher than in-network payment rates that are covered under commercial contracted plans. for the last two years, the growth of our commercial patients slightly outpaced the growth of our government-based patients as more of our patients are covered by commercial contracted plans.
government dialysis-related payment rates in the u.s. are principally determined by federal medicare and state medicaid policy. for patients with medicare coverage, all esrd payments for dialysis treatments are made under a single bundled payment rate which provides a fixed payment rate encompassing all goods and services provided during the dialysis treatment, including certain pharmaceuticals, such as epogen® (epo), vitamin d analogs and iron supplements, irrespective of the level of pharmaceuticals administered to the patient or additional services performed. most lab services are also included in the bundled payment. the bundled payment rate is also adjusted for certain patient characteristics, a geographic usage index and certain other factors.
the bundled payment system presents operating, clinical and financial risks. for example, with regard to the expanded list of case-mix adjustors, there is a risk that our dialysis centers or billing and other systems may not accurately document and track the
68
appropriate patient-specific characteristics, resulting in a reduction or overpayment in the amounts of the payments that we would otherwise be entitled to receive.
an important provision in the law is an annual adjustment, or market basket update, to the esrd prospective payment system (pps) base rate. absent action by congress, the pps base rate is automatically updated annually by a formulaic inflation adjustment.
in december 2013, cms issued the 2014 final rule for the esrd pps, which phases in the payment reductions mandated by atra, as modified by the protecting access to medicare act of 2014 which reduced our market basket inflation adjustment by 1.25% in 2016 and will reduce our market basket inflation adjustment by 1.25% in 2017 and 1% in 2018. cms recently published the 2017 final rule for the esrd pps and projects it will (i) increase the total payments to all esrd facilities by 0.73% in 2017 compared to 2016; (ii) increase total payments to hospital-based esrd facilities by 0.9% in 2017 compared to 2016; and (iii) increase total payments for freestanding facilities by 0.7% in 2017 compared to 2016. the 2017 final rule for the esrd pps also implements the trade preferences extension act of 2015 provisions regarding the coverage and payment for renal dialysis services furnished by esrd facilities to individuals with acute kidney injury.
as a result of the bca and subsequent activity in congress, a $1.2 trillion sequester (across-the-board spending cuts) in discretionary programs took effect on march 1, 2013. in particular, a 2% reduction to medicare payments took effect on april 1, 2013, which was subsequently extended through 2014 and 2015. the bipartisan budget act of 2015 extended the bca's annual 2% reduction to medicare payments through fiscal year 2025. these across-the-board spending cuts have affected and will continue to adversely affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows.
the cms innovation center is currently working with various healthcare providers to develop, refine and implement acos and other innovative models of care for medicare and medicaid beneficiaries. we are currently uncertain of the extent to which the long-term operation and evolution of these models of care, including acos, bundled payments for care improvement initiative, the cec model (which includes the development of escos), the comprehensive primary care initiative, the duals demonstration, or other models, will impact the healthcare market over time. our u.s. dialysis business may choose to participate in one or several of these models either as a partner with other providers or independently. we currently participate in the cec model with the innovation center, including with the esco organizations in the arizona, florida, and adjacent new jersey and pennsylvania markets. in areas where davita is not directly participating in this or other innovation center models, some of our patients may be assigned to an aco, another esrd care model, or another program, in which case the quality and cost of care that we furnish will be included in an aco's, another esrd care model's or other programs' calculations. as new models of care emerge and evolve, we may be at risk of losing our medicare patient base, which would have a materially adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flow. other initiatives in the government or private sector may also arise, including the development of models similar to acos, ipas and integrated delivery networks or evolutions of those concepts which could adversely impact our business.
we anticipate that we will continue to experience increases in our operating costs in 2017 that will outpace any net medicare rate increases that we may receive, which could significantly impact our operating results. in addition, we expect to continue experiencing increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation, such as labor and supply costs, regardless of whether there is a compensating inflation-based increase in medicare payment rates or in payments under the bundled payment rate system.
dialysis payment rates from commercial payors can vary and a major portion of our commercial rates are set at contracted amounts with payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. our commercial payment rates also include payments for out-of-network patients that on average are higher than our in-network commercial contract rates. we continue to enter into some commercial contracts covering certain patients that will primarily pay us a single bundled payment rate for all dialysis services provided to these patients. however, some contracts will pay us for certain other services and pharmaceuticals in addition to the bundled payment. we are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors, and if our negotiations result in overall commercial contract payment rate reductions in excess of our commercial contract payment rate increases, our revenues and operating results could be negatively impacted. in addition, if there is an increase in job losses in the u.s., or depending upon changes to the healthcare regulatory system by cms and/or the impact of healthcare insurance exchanges, we could experience a decrease in the number of patients covered under traditional commercial insurance plans. patients with commercial insurance who cannot otherwise maintain coverage frequently rely on financial assistance from charitable organizations, such as the american kidney fund. if these patients are unable to obtain or continue to receive such financial assistance, our revenues, earnings, and cash flows could be substantially reduced. for further details, see the risk factor in item 1a risk factors under the heading "if patients in commercial plans are subject to restriction in plan designs or the average rates that commercial payors pay us decline significantly, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows."
our operating performance with respect to dialysis services billing and collection can also be a significant factor in the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment we recognize and are able to collect. over the past several years we have invested heavily in upgrades to our systems and internal processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduced our regulatory compliance risks, and we expect to continue to improve these systems and processes. we continue to
69
upgrade our billing and other systems and modify our processes to improve our ability to capture the necessary patient characteristics, co-morbidities and certain other factors under medicare's bundled payment system. we believe this will potentially enable us to capture additional reimbursement amounts from medicare and enhance our overall billing and collection performance. however, as we continue to make upgrades to our systems and processes, or as payors change their systems and requirements, such as changes to medicare's billing codes, we could experience a negative impact to our cash collection performance, which would affect our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment.
our dialysis and related lab services revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectability of our billings as of the reporting date based upon our actual historical collection experience. changes in estimates are reflected in the then-current period financial statements based upon on-going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies.
our annual average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment was approximately $352, $348 and $342 for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. in 2016, the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment increased by approximately $4 per treatment due to an increase in our average commercial payment rates and improvements in our commercial payor mix. in 2015, the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment increased by approximately $6 per treatment due to an increase in our average commercial payment rates and improvements in our commercial payor mix, partially offset by an increase in our provision for uncollectible accounts.
our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment can be significantly impacted by several major factors, including our commercial payment rates; government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments covered under medicare's bundled payment rate system, including our ability to capture certain patient characteristics; and changes in the mix of government and commercial patients and the number of commercial patients that are either covered under commercial contracts or are out of network.
the principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, utilization levels of pharmaceuticals, business infrastructure costs, which include the operating costs of our dialysis centers, and certain professional fees. however, other cost categories can also represent significant cost variability, such as employee benefit costs, payroll taxes, insurance costs and medical supply costs. our average clinical hours per treatment, or productivity levels, declined slightly in 2016 compared to 2015. we are always striving for improved productivity levels, however, changes in federal and state policies or regulatory billing requirements can lead to increased labor costs in order to implement these new requirements, which can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. in addition, improvements in the u.s. economy have stimulated additional competition for skilled clinical personnel resulting in slightly higher teammate turnover in 2016, which we believe negatively affected productivity levels. in 2016 and 2015, we experienced an increase in our clinical labor rates of approximately 2.8% and 0.9%, respectively, as clinical labor rates have increased, consistent with general industry trends, mainly due to the high demand for skilled clinical personnel, along with general inflation increases. we also continue to experience increases in our infrastructure and operating costs of our dialysis centers, primarily due to the number of new dialysis centers opened, and general increases in rent, utilities and repairs and maintenance. in 2016, we continued to implement certain cost control initiatives to manage our overall operating costs, including labor productivity.
our dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses represented 8.2% of our dialysis and related lab services net revenues in both 2016 and 2015. although relatively flat as a percentage of net revenue, general and administrative expenses increased by $42 million, primarily due to an increase in labor and benefit costs and legal costs, partially offset by lower long-term incentive compensation. increases in general and administrative expenses over the last several years primarily related to strengthening our dialysis business, improving our regulatory compliance and other operational processes, responding to certain legal and compliance matters, and professional fees associated with enhancing our information technology systems. we expect that these levels of expenditures on our dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses will continue in 2017 and could possibly increase as we seek out new business opportunities within the dialysis industry and continue to invest in improving our information technology infrastructure and the level of support required for our regulatory compliance and legal matters.

net revenues dialysis and related lab services net revenues for 2016 increased by approximately $496 million, or 5.7%, from 2015. the increase in net revenues was primarily driven by solid volume growth from additional treatments of approximately 4.5% due to an increase in acquired and non-acquired treatment growth at existing and new dialysis centers, as well as one additional treatment day in 2016 as compared to 2015. dialysis and related lab services' net revenues also benefited from an increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $4, primarily due to an increase in our average commercial payment rates and improvements in our commercial payor mix, offset by an increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts of $24 million.
dialysis and related lab services net revenues for 2015 increased by approximately $431 million, or 5.2%, from 2014. the increase in net revenues was primarily due to solid volume growth from additional treatments of approximately 4.0% due to an increase in non-acquired treatment growth at existing and new dialysis centers and an increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $6. the increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2015, as compared to 2014, was due to an increase in our average commercial payment rates and improvements in our commercial payor mix, offset by an increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts of $53 million.

the following table summarizes our u.s. dialysis services revenues by source:
2016            2015            2014

medicare and medicare-assigned plans                       55   %          56   %          58   %
medicaid and medicaid-assigned plans                        5   %           6   %           6   %
other government-based programs                             4   %           4   %           3   %
total government-based programs                            64   %          66   %          67   %
commercial (including hospital dialysis services)          36   %          34   %          33   %
total dialysis and related lab services revenues          100   %         100   %         100   %
approximately 64% of our total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 were from government-based programs, principally medicare, medicaid, medicare-assigned and medicaid-assigned plans, representing approximately 88% of our total patients. over the last two years, the growth of our commercial patients slightly outpaced the growth of our government-based patients as more of our patients are covered by commercial contracted plans. less than 1% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are due directly from patients. there is no single commercial payor that accounted for more than 10% of total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016.
on average, dialysis-related payment rates from contracted commercial payors are significantly higher than medicare, medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients as a relationship to total patients represents a major driver of our total average dialysis revenue per treatment. for a patient covered by a commercial insurance plan, medicare generally becomes the primary payor after 33 months, which includes the three month waiting period, or earlier if the patient's commercial insurance plan coverage terminates. when medicare becomes the primary payor, the payment rates we receive for that patient shifts from the commercial insurance plan rates to medicare payment rates, which are significantly lower than commercial insurance rates. medicare payment rates are insufficient to cover our costs associated with providing dialysis services, and we therefore lose money on each medicare treatment that we provide.
nearly all of our net earnings from our dialysis and related lab services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at established contract rates and others of which pay negotiated payment rates based on our usual and customary fee schedule for our out-of-network patients, which are typically higher than commercial contracted rates. if we experience an overall net reduction in our contracted and non-contracted commercial payment rates as a result of negotiations, restrictions or changes to the healthcare regulatory system, including the potential impact of healthcare insurance exchanges, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
operating expenses and charges patient care costs. dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and consist principally of labor, benefits, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and other operating costs of the dialysis centers. dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were $226 and $221 for 2016 and 2015, respectively. the $5 increase in per treatment costs in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in labor and benefit costs due to a decrease in productivity, increased turnover and clinical labor rates, an increase in other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers and an increase in pharmaceutical unit costs. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional fees.
dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were $221 and $219 for 2015 and 2014, respectively. the $2 increase in per treatment costs in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to higher overall pharmaceutical costs due to higher pharmaceutical unit costs, an increase in other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers, and a slight increase in labor costs, partially offset by improvements in productivity, and lower general and professional insurance costs.
general and administrative expenses. dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses in 2016 increased by approximately $42 million as compared to 2015. the increase was primarily due to an increase in our labor and benefit costs, occupancy, and legal costs, partially offset by a decrease in long-term compensation costs.
dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses in 2015 increased by approximately $27 million as compared to 2014. the increase was primarily due to an increase in our labor and benefit costs and long-term compensation costs.
depreciation and amortization. dialysis and related lab services depreciation and amortization expenses for 2016 increased by approximately $45 million as compared to 2015 and increased by $35 million in 2015 as compared to 2014. the increases were primarily due to both growth through new dialysis center developments and additional informational technology initiatives.
72
provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable for our dialysis and related lab services business was 4.5% for 2016 and 2015, and 4.1% for 2014. the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable was flat as a percent of revenue in 2016 and 2015. we currently expect the level of the provision for uncollectible accounts in 2017 to be consistent with 2016 although it may increase if we encounter collection issues.
equity investment income. equity investment income was approximately $18 million, $15 million and $14 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increases in equity investment income over the last three years were primarily due to the increase in the number of nonconsolidated dialysis joint ventures and an increase in profitability at some of these joint ventures.
accounts receivable. our u.s. dialysis and related lab services accounts receivable balances at december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015 were $1.358 billion and $1.255 billion, respectively, representing approximately 55 days and 53 days of revenue, respectively, net of the allowance for uncollectible accounts. the increase in day sales outstanding (dso) for our dialysis and related lab services business was primarily the result of improved cash collection performance in 2015 which we did not experience in 2016. our dso calculation is based on the current quarter's average revenues per day.
as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, our dialysis and related lab services unreserved accounts receivable balances that were more than six months old were approximately $216 million and $233 million, respectively, representing approximately 16% and 18% of our dialysis accounts receivable balances, respectively. there were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. less than 1% of our revenues are classified as patient pay. substantially all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors, as discussed above.
amounts pending approval from third-party payors associated with medicare bad debt claims as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, other than the standard monthly billing, consisted of approximately $105 million in 2016 and $106 million in 2015 and is classified as other receivables. currently, a significant portion of our medicare bad debt claims are typically paid to us before the medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims. however, the payment received from medicare is subject to adjustment based upon the actual results of the audits. such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed.
segment operating income dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2016 increased by approximately $517 million as compared to 2015, which included a settlement charge of $495 million. excluding this item from 2015, dialysis and related lab services adjusted operating income would have increased by $22 million. this increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to treatment growth as a result of additional dialysis treatments, one additional treatment day, and an increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $4, as described above. adjusted operating income also increased due to a decrease in long-term compensation costs, partially offset by higher patient care costs and an increase general administrative expenses.
dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2015, which included a settlement charge of $495 million, decreased by approximately $378 million as compared to 2014, which included a loss contingency accrual of $17 million. excluding these items from their respective periods, dialysis and related lab services adjusted operating income for 2015 would have increased by $100 million. this increase in adjusted operating income for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to solid treatment growth as a result of additional dialysis treatments and an increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $6, as described above. adjusted operating income also increased due to improved productivity and lower general and professional insurance costs, partially offset by higher overall pharmaceutical costs, as described above, and an increase in our provision for uncollectible accounts of $53 million.
dmg business dmg is a patient- and physician-focused, integrated healthcare delivery and management company with over two decades of experience providing coordinated, outcomes-based medical care in a cost-effective manner. as of december 31, 2016, dmg served approximately 749,300 members under its care in southern california, central and south florida, southern nevada and central new mexico through capitation contracts with some of the nation's leading health plans. of these 749,300 members, approximately 305,200 individuals were patients enrolled in medicare and medicare advantage, and the remaining approximately 444,100 individuals were managed care members whose health coverage is provided through their employer or who have individually acquired health coverage directly from a health plan or as a result of their eligibility for medicaid benefits. in addition to its managed care business, during the year ended december 31, 2016, dmg provided care across all markets to over 896,200 patients whose health coverage is structured on a ffs basis, including patients enrolled through traditional medicare and medicaid programs, preferred provider organizations and other third party payors.
dmg's patients as well as the patients of dmg's associated physicians, physician groups and ipas benefit from an integrated approach to medical care that places the physician at the center of patient care. as of december 31, 2016, dmg delivered services to
73
its members via a network of approximately 700 primary care physicians, over 2,500 associated groups and other network primary care physicians, approximately 200 network hospitals, and several thousand associated group and network specialists. together with hundreds of case managers, registered nurses and other care coordinators, these medical professionals utilize a comprehensive information technology system, sophisticated risk management techniques and clinical protocols to provide high-quality, cost-effective care to dmg's members. dmg's total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2016, was approximately $4.114 billion, or approximately 28% of our consolidated net revenues.
key financial measures and indicators operating revenues dmg's consolidated revenues consist primarily of capitated revenues, including revenues attributable to capitated contracts with health plans, patient fee-for-service revenues and other operating revenues, each as described in more detail below.
capitation revenue derived from health plans typically results from either (i) premium payments by cms to dmg's health plan customers under medicare advantage with respect to seniors, disabled and other eligible persons (which are referred to herein as dmg's senior membership), (ii) premium payments by state governments to dmg's health plan customers under medicaid managed care programs (which are referred to herein as dmg's medicaid membership), and (iii) premium payments from public and private employers and individuals to dmg's health plan customers with respect to their employees (which are referred to herein as dmg's commercial membership). capitation payments under health plan contracts are made monthly based on the number of enrollees selecting a dmg associated group physician employed or associated with one of dmg's medical group entities as their primary healthcare provider. the amount of pmpm capitation payments that dmg receives monthly from health plans on behalf of a member generally does not vary during a given calendar year, regardless of the level of actual medical services utilized by the member. as described in more detail below, in central florida and southern nevada dmg principally utilizes a global capitation model in which it assumes the financial responsibility for both professional (physician) and institutional (hospital) services for covered benefits, whereas in new mexico, dmg assumes the financial responsibility for professional services only. in southern california, dmg utilizes variants of a different model for capitation under which it is directly financially responsible for covered professional services, but indirectly financially responsible for covered institutional expenses. see below for further discussion regarding changes to dmg's revenue recognition for hospital services. dmg's associated medical groups also receive specified incentive payments from health plans based on specified performance and quality criteria. these amounts are accrued when earned and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.
•   global capitation model. dmg records the aggregate global capitation pmpm fee as revenue and the amounts paid with respect to claims as medical expenses or hospital expenses, as applicable. see "patient care costs-medical expenses" and "patient care costs-hospital expenses" below. revenue with respect to both professional and institutional capitation is recorded in the month in which enrollees are entitled to receive healthcare. in dmg's central florida market, dmg also receives capitation revenue and is liable for corresponding expenses for prescription drug activity rendered on behalf of dmg's senior members through the part d component under the medicare advantage program.

•   risk-sharing model. as compensation under its various managed care-related administrative services agreements with hospitals, dmg is entitled to receive a percentage of the amount by which the institutional capitation revenue received from health plans exceeds institutional expenses, and any such risk-share amount to which dmg is entitled is recorded as medical revenues. in addition, pursuant to such managed care-related administrative services agreements, dmg agrees to be responsible should the third party incur institutional expenses in excess of institutional capitation revenue. as with global capitation, revenue with respect to professional capitation is reported in the month in which enrollees are entitled to receive healthcare. however, risk-share revenues (that is, the portion of the excess or deficit of institutional capitation revenue to which dmg is entitled less institutional expenses), in contrast, are based on the number of enrollees and estimates of institutional utilization and associated costs incurred by assigned health plan enrollees, and the amounts earned are accrued when they can be reasonably estimated. differences between actual contract settlements and estimated receivables and payables are recorded in the year of final settlement. in december 2013, dmg obtained a restricted knox-keene license in california, which permits dmg to enter into global capitation agreements with health plans that allow dmg to assume financial responsibility for both professional and institutional services. dmg has evaluated its various risk sharing arrangements, and is working with the department of managed health care and several health plans to accept global capitation. dmg has converted three separate contracts covering approximately 3% of total dhpc's membership to global risk and is in the approval and implementation process to convert additional contracts to global risk in 2017. completion of evaluation of possible additional conversions is expected to continue to occur over time.

74
•   retroactive revenue adjustments. the medicare advantage revenue received by dmg's health plan customers is adjusted periodically to give effect to the relative clinical and demographic profile of the members for whom dmg is financially responsible. the model employed by cms bases a portion of the total reimbursement payments on various clinical and demographic factors, including hospital inpatient diagnoses, additional diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings, hospital outpatient department and physician visits, gender, age and medicaid eligibility. cms requires that all managed care companies capture, collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms twice a year for reconciliation with cms's internal database. capitation payments under this methodology are paid at interim rates during the year and retroactive adjustments occur in subsequent periods (generally in the third quarter of the same year, with a final adjustment in the third quarter of the following year) after the data is compiled by cms. dmg estimates the amount of the current year adjustments in revenues during the first and second quarters of any given year and adjusts its estimates during the third quarter, upon receipt of payments from cms. differences between actual contract settlements and estimated revenues are recorded in the year of final settlement. to date, all such adjustments have resulted in increases in revenue.

•   patient service revenues. patient service revenues are recorded when the services are provided to patients on a ffs basis. such revenues are based on a negotiated fixed-fee schedule with the applicable payor.

•   other operating revenues. in addition to the revenues discussed above, other operating revenues primarily consists of (i) hospital subsidy payments, (ii) management fees dmg receives as the manager of its unconsolidated joint ventures, (iii) revenues from the maintenance of existing physicians' networks, (iv) medical consulting revenues, and (v) revenues recognized under meaningful use programs established by federal and state governments which provide financial incentives for providers to implement and utilize electronic health record technology to improve patient care.

patient care costs dmg's largest patient care costs are the costs of medical services provided pursuant to its capitation contracts, which consist of medical expenses, hospital expenses and clinical support and other operating costs, as further described below. under both the global capitation and the risk-share capitation models, costs of medical services are recognized in the month in which the related services are provided. in addition, medical expenses and hospital expenses include an estimate of such expenses that have been incurred but not yet reported. for further information on how dmg estimates such claims, see "critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments-medical liability claims associated with dmg" below.
medical expenses. medical expenses consist of payments for professional and ancillary services to independent primary care physicians, specialists, ancillary providers and hospitals (including, with respect to hospitals, for outpatient services) pursuant to agreements with those entities. the structure of such expenses can consist of, among other things, sub-capitation and ffs payments. in addition, medical expenses include compensation and related expenses incurred with respect to dmg's associated group primary care physicians and specialists, registered nurses, physician assistants and hospitalists.
hospital expenses. hospital expenses consist of payments for institutional services to contracted and non-contracted hospitals for both inpatient and outpatient services, skilled nursing facilities, and to other institutional providers. hospital expenses are only incurred in connection with the services dmg provides in florida and nevada. in those regions, as described above, dmg enters into contracts with health plans pursuant to which it assumes the risk for institutional hospital services. in contrast in california, dmg's medical groups were not permitted to contract with health plans to directly assume the risk for institutional services. accordingly, the risk-share revenue that dmg records in california is net of reported claims and estimates of hospital utilization and associated costs incurred by assigned health plan enrollees, and no portion of institutional hospital costs incurred with respect to dmg's california operations is included in hospital expenses as presented. however, as a result of dmg obtaining a restricted knox-keene license in december 2013 as discussed above, dmg now assumes some risk for institutional services in california.
clinic support and other operating costs. clinic support and other operating costs primarily consist of the costs incurred with respect to compensation of administrative and other support staff employed at dmg's medical clinics, clinic rent and utilities, medical supplies and other direct costs incurred to support clinic operations.
other operating expenses general and administrative. general and administrative expenses are those costs directly related to corporate administrative functions in supporting dmg and consist primarily of salaries and benefits, professional fees and occupancy costs.

capitated membership information the table set forth below provides (i) the total number of capitated members to whom dmg provided healthcare services as of december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, and (ii) the aggregate member months for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. member months represent the aggregate number of months of healthcare services dmg has provided to capitated members during a period of time.
in addition to the members above, dmg provided healthcare services to members in two of its operating unconsolidated joint ventures that are accounted for as equity investments. these joint ventures provided healthcare services for approximately 148,700, 130,700 and 45,700 members as of december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and for approximately 1,760,000, 1,564,200 and 538,000 member months for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increase in members and member months was primarily due to an increase in members related to tandigm.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, dmg members decreased by approximately 58,100 and member months decreased by approximately 617,000. the decrease in members and member months was due to planned non-renewals of certain commercial and medicaid contracts, a decrease in commercial members as employers shift to less expensive options for medical services for their employees, and the sale of our dmg arizona business which caused a decrease in senior members, partially offset by an increase in senior members from new acquisitions and non-acquired growth.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, dmg members decreased by approximately 29,900 and member months increased approximately 62,400. the decrease in members was due to a planned reduction in medicaid members and a decline in commercial members as employers shift to less expensive options for medical services for their employees, partially offset by an increase in senior members due to non-acquired growth. the increase in member months was primarily attributable to an increase in senior members resulting from non-acquired growth, new acquisitions and an increase in medicaid members due to medicaid expansion. this increase in member months was partially offset by a planned non-renewal of certain plans in certain markets due to unfavorable economics.

77
net revenues dmg's net revenues for 2016 increased $277 million, or 7.2%, primarily due to an increase in ffs revenues due to the acquisition of the everett clinic medical group (tec) in march 2016 and an increase in senior capitated revenues due to an increase in the number of senior capitated members during the year attributable to non-acquired growth and acquisitions. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in medicare advantage and medicaid rates, as described below, a decrease in senior capitated revenues from the sale of our dmg arizona business, a decrease in medicaid revenues due to the timing of the recognition of additional medicaid risk sharing revenue in 2015, a decrease in other revenues due to the recognition of additional revenues related to the maintenance of existing physician networks in 2015, a decrease in other consulting revenues and a decrease in commercial and medicaid members to whom dmg provides health care services.
dmg's net revenue for 2015 increased $335 million, or 9.6%, primarily driven by an increase in ffs revenue from acquisitions, an increase in senior capitated revenue due to an increase in the number of senior capitated members during the year that is attributable to non-acquired growth and acquisitions, an increase in medicaid memberships due to medicaid expansion, recognition of additional medicaid risk-share revenue due to decreased costs related to lower claims, and higher commercial negotiated rates for commercial members. these increases in net revenues were partially offset by a decrease in senior capitated revenues due to the planned non-renewal of some plans due to unfavorable economics in certain markets.
on april 4, 2016, cms issued final guidance for 2017 medicare advantage benchmark payment rates (rate announcement). in 2017, cms will fully implement the 2017 risk adjustment model proposed in the rate announcement, but with updated coefficients. based upon our preliminary analysis of the final rule, we estimate that the reduction in 2017 rates, including adjustments for the new aca blended benchmark county rates and qualifying bonuses, will lead to a reduction in medicare advantage rates to dmg of approximately 1.0%, or a net decrease of approximately $25 million to our 2017 operating income. this compares, according to cms, to an industry average rate increase of approximately 0.85% without accounting for the expected growth in coding acuity that has typically added another 2.2%. the final impact of 2017 medicare advantage rates may vary from this estimate and will be impacted by the relative growth of dmg's medicare advantage patient volumes across markets as well as by the benefit plan designs submitted. it is possible that we have underestimated the impact of the 2017 medicare advantage rates on our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation or cash flows. the more significant decreases in medicare advantage rates for the company compared to the industry average are largely driven by two factors: dmg's higher mix of medicare advantage patients in counties that will receive a lower-than-average benchmark rate increase, and a higher-than-average impact from a revision to the risk model to differentiate payment levels between dual-eligible and non-dual-eligible patients.
the 2016 medicare advantage rates incorporated a modification to the risk adjustment model calculation that cms utilizes to determine the risk acuity scores of medicare advantage patients. these changes to the rate structure and risk model calculation decreased dmg's 2016 medicare advantage rates by approximately 2.0% of the medicare advantage revenues dmg manages on behalf of its senior capitated population as compared to 2015. this compares, according to cms, to the industry average rate increase of approximately 1.25%.
the more significant decline in medicare advantage rates for dmg compared to the industry average is driven by a larger-than-average decline associated with cms's modification to the risk adjustment model calculations. we believe the full implementation of the 2014 cms-hcc risk adjustment model negatively affects dmg and other providers like us who have invested more heavily in wellness and prevention programs for patients with chronic conditions.
patient care costs the following table reflects dmg's patient care costs which are comprised of medical expenses, hospital expenses, clinic support and other operating costs:
year ended december 31,

2016                 2015                  2014

operating expenses patient care costs. dmg's patient care costs for 2016 increased by approximately $285 million from 2015. the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of tec, an increase in medical claim expenses, hospital expenses, and clinic support costs due
78
to increased senior capitated members from acquisitions and non-acquired growth, and increased headcount. the increase in costs was partially offset by a decrease due to the sale of our arizona business, decreased consulting expenses, a decrease in benefits, and a decrease in commercial and medicaid members to whom dmg provides healthcare services.
dmg's patient care costs for 2015 increased by approximately $210 million from 2014. the increase was primarily attributable to increases in medical claim expenses and hospital expenses due to increases in senior and medicaid member months from acquisitions, non-acquired growth, medicaid expansion, market expansion and the timing of the recognition of additional benefit expense related to higher medicaid risk sharing revenues. the increase was also driven by an increase in clinic support costs due to acquisitions. the increase in costs was partially offset by a decrease in commercial members to whom dmg provides healthcare services and a decrease in costs due to the planned non-renewal of some plans due to unfavorable economics in certain markets.
general and administrative expenses. dmg's general and administrative costs for 2016, which includes an estimated accrual for damages and liabilities associated with our dmg nevada hospice business of $16 million, increased $68 million from 2015. excluding this item, adjusted general and administrative expenses would have increased by $52 million. this increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of tec, an increase in corporate administrative support expenses due to increased labor costs and costs associated with growth initiatives, partially offset by a decrease due to the sale of our dmg arizona business and a decrease in benefits.
dmg's general and administrative costs for 2015 increased $90 million from 2014. this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in corporate administrative support costs related to growth initiatives, professional fees, recognition of additional compensation expense, and travel costs.
depreciation and amortization. dmg's depreciation and amortization for 2016 increased $37 million from 2015. the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of tec, an increase in amortization related to the acceleration of the hcp-related trade names, and an increase in technology and property investments as part of our growth initiatives. as of september 1, 2016, we committed to a plan to change hcp trade names to dmg. as a result of this decision we began to accelerate the amortization of the remaining carrying value of hcp trade names, which resulted in additional amortization of $9 million for 2016. this additional amortization will continue at a rate of approximately $7 million per quarter through the first quarter of 2019 which represents the remaining life of these assets.
dmg's depreciation and amortization for 2015 increased $4 million from 2014. the increase is primarily attributable to depreciation and amortization of assets associated with acquisitions.
goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recognized impairment charges of $189 million on goodwill and $17 million on other intangible assets of certain dmg reporting units based on assessments performed after circumstances indicated it had become more likely than not that the goodwill of certain dmg reporting units had become impaired. these circumstances included underperformance of the business in recent quarters, as well as changes in other market conditions, including government reimbursement cuts and our expected ability to mitigate them.
based on continuing developments at our dmg reporting units during 2016, including the medicare advantage final benchmark rates for 2017 announced on april 4, 2016, further changes in our expectations concerning future government reimbursement rates and our expected ability to mitigate them, as well as medical cost and utilization trends, underperformance of certain at-risk units in recent quarters and other market conditions, we performed additional goodwill impairment assessments for certain at-risk dmg reporting units during each of the first three quarters of 2016 and as of their november 1 annual assessment date.
as a result of the assessments described above, we have recognized the dmg goodwill impairment charges shown below:

gain on sales of business interests. effective june 30, 2016, we sold a portion of our ownership interest in tandigm, reducing our ownership from 50% to 19% and resulting in a pre-tax gain of $40 million. in addition, on june 1, 2016, we sold our dmg arizona business for a pre-tax loss of $10 million.
79
equity investment loss (income). dmg's share of equity investment income from our nonconsolidated joint ventures for 2016 decreased $8 million from 2015. this increase in equity losses was primarily attributable to a decrease in profitability of certain joint ventures, partially offset by the sale of a portion of our tandigm ownership interest during second quarter which resulted in a reduced share of equity investment losses during the third and fourth quarters of 2016.
dmg's share of equity investment income from our nonconsolidated joint venture relationships for 2015 decreased $6 million from 2014. this decrease in equity income was primarily attributable to our share of expenses from a certain newly formed joint venture that provides integrated healthcare and reduced commercial risk pool performance.
segment operating income dmg's operating income for 2016, which includes the goodwill impairment charges of $253 million, the gain related to the sale of a portion of our tandigm ownership interest of $40 million, the loss on the sale of our dmg arizona business of $10 million and an estimated accrual for damages and liabilities associated with our dmg nevada hospice business of $16 million, decreased $138 million from 2015, which included estimated goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $206 million related to certain reporting units. excluding these items from their respective periods, adjusted operating income for the year ended december 31, 2016 would have decreased by approximately $105 million. this decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily attributable to a decrease in medicare advantage and medicaid rates, a decrease in revenue due to the timing of medicaid risk sharing revenue and additional revenues related to the maintenance of existing physicians networks recognized in 2015, the acquisition of tec, an increase in depreciation and amortization related to the trade names acceleration, and an increase in technology and property investments and corporate administrative support costs, partially offset by a decrease in benefits and an increase in senior capitated members due to acquisitions and non-acquired growth.
dmg's operating income for 2015, which included estimated goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $206 million related to certain reporting units decreased $181 million from 2014. excluding this item from 2015, adjusted operating income for the year ended december 31, 2015 would have increased by approximately $25 million, or 11.6%. this increase in adjusted operating income was primarily attributable to an increase in ffs revenue from acquisitions and non-acquired growth, an increase in medicaid members due to medicaid expansion, the timing of recognition of additional medicare risk share revenue and a reduction of claims expense due to the planned non-renewal of some plans due to unfavorable economics in certain markets. this increase was partially offset by a decrease in commercial members, and higher general and administrative costs.
other-ancillary services and strategic initiatives business our other operations include ancillary services and strategic initiatives which are primarily aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our network of patients. as of december 31, 2016, these consisted primarily of pharmacy services, disease management services, vascular access services, clinical research programs, physician services, direct primary care and our international dialysis operations. the ancillary services and strategic initiatives generated approximately $1.621 billion of net revenues in 2016, representing approximately 10% of our consolidated net revenues. we currently expect to continue to invest in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including our continued expansion into certain international markets, as we work to develop successful new business operations. however, any significant change in market conditions, business performance or in the regulatory environment may impact the economic viability of any of these strategic initiatives. any unfavorable changes in these strategic initiatives could result in a write-off or an impairment of some or all of our investments, including goodwill, and could also result in significant termination costs if we were to exit a certain line of business or one or more of our international markets.
as of december 31, 2016, we provided dialysis and administrative services to a total of 154 outpatient dialysis centers located in 11 countries outside of the u.s. our international dialysis operations are still in an early phase of development as we primarily commenced operations during the fourth quarter of 2011. the total net revenues generated from our international operations, as reflected below, were approximately 1% of our 2016 consolidated net revenues.

(1)   for the year ended december 31, 2016, we have excluded a goodwill impairment charge of $28 million related to our vascular access reporting unit, an estimated accrual of $16 million for damages and liabilities associated with our pharmacy business, an impairment of $15 million related to a minority equity investment, and a gain on the apac jv ownership changes of $374 million. for the year ended december 31, 2015, we have excluded estimated goodwill impairment charges of $4 million and an estimated accrual of $22 million for damages and liabilities associated with our pharmacy business. these are non-gaap measures and are not intended as substitutes for the equivalent gaap measures. we have presented these adjusted amounts because management believes that these presentations enhance a user's understanding of our normal consolidated operating income by excluding certain items which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results of operations. as a result, adjusting for these amounts allows for comparison to our normal prior period results.

net revenues ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues for 2016 increased by approximately $239 million, or 17.3%, as compared to 2015. the increase was primarily related to an increase in pharmaceutical rates, a decrease in reserves due to refunds of pharmacy reimbursements taken in 2015 that did not reoccur in 2016, an increase in villagehealth special needs plan revenues and an increase in net revenues from our expansion in our international business and other strategic initiatives. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in our pharmacy services volume.
ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues for 2015 increased by approximately $243 million, or 21.3%, as compared to 2014. the increase was primarily related to an increase in pharmacy services volume and pharmaceutical rates, as well as an increase in net revenues from growth in our international business and other strategic initiatives. these increases were partially offset by an increase in reserves for refunds of prior period pharmacy reimbursements.
81
operating and general expenses ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2016, which includes an estimated accrual for damages and liabilities associated with our pharmacy business of $16 million, increased by approximately $203 million from 2015, which included an estimated accrual for damages and liabilities associated with our pharmacy business of $22 million. excluding these items from their respective periods, ancillary services and strategic initiatives adjusted operating expenses would have increased by $209 million. this increase in adjusted operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in pharmaceutical unit costs, labor and benefit costs, professional fees, other general and administration expenses, and additional expenses associated with our international dialysis expansion, partially offset by a decrease in prescription dispensing volume and long-term incentive compensation expense.
ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2015, which included an estimated accrual for damages and liabilities associated with our pharmacy business of $22 million, increased by approximately $318 million from 2014. excluding this item from 2015, the ancillary services and strategic initiatives adjusted operating expenses would have increased by $296 million. this increase in adjusted operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in prescription dispensing volume, higher pharmaceutical costs, higher labor costs and related payroll taxes and benefit costs, additional expenses associated with our international dialysis expansion, and an increase in costs associated with the right to use intellectual property and general and administrative and corporate administrative support expenses.
goodwill and other asset impairment charges. during the quarter ended december 31, 2016, we determined that circumstances indicated it had become more likely than not that the goodwill of our vascular access reporting unit had become impaired. these circumstances included changes in governmental reimbursement and our expected ability to mitigate them. specifically, on november 2, 2016, cms released the 2017 physician fee schedule final rule and the ambulatory surgical center payment final rule which reflected significant changes in reimbursement structure for this business unit. we have performed the required valuations to estimate the fair value of the net assets and implied goodwill of this reporting unit with the assistance of a third-party valuation firm. based on this assessment, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $28 million.
in 2016, we also recorded an impairment of $15 million related to a minority equity investment in one of our international reporting units.
in 2015, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $4 million in one of our international reporting units.
gain on changes in ownership interests in asia pacific joint venture (apac jv)
on august 1, 2016, we consummated an agreement with khazanah nasional berhad (khazanah) and mitsui and co., ltd (mitsui) whereby khazanah and mitsui subscribed to invest a total of $300 million over three years in exchange for a 40% total equity interest in our apac jv. khazanah and mitsui each made related initial investments of $50 million in this business on august 1, 2016.
as a result of this transaction, we deconsolidated our asia pacific dialysis business in the third quarter and recognized a non-cash non-taxable gain of $374 million on our retained investment in the apac jv net of contingent obligations as a result of adjusting the carrying value of our retained interest in the apac jv to our proportionate share of the estimated fair value of the business.
segment operating income (loss)
ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating income for 2016, which includes a gain on the apac jv ownership changes of $374 million, a goodwill impairment charge of $28 million related to our vascular access reporting unit, an estimated accrual for damages and liabilities associated with our pharmacy business of $16 million and an impairment of $15 million related to a minority equity investment, increased by approximately $371 million from 2015, which includes an estimated accrual for damages and liabilities of $22 million, as well as a goodwill impairment charge of $4 million related to our international operations. excluding these items from their respective periods, adjusted operating losses would have decreased by $30 million. this decrease in adjusted operating losses was primarily due to an increase in pharmaceutical rates, a decrease in reserves due to refunds of pharmacy reimbursements taken in 2015 that did not reoccur in 2016, an increase in villagehealth special needs plan revenues and an increase in net revenues from our expansion in our international business and other strategic initiatives. the decrease in adjusted operating losses was partially offset by an increase in pharmaceutical unit costs, higher labor and benefits costs and additional expenses associated with our international dialysis expansion.
ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2015 increased by approximately $79 million from 2014 which includes an estimated accrual for damages and liabilities of $22 million, as well as a goodwill impairment charge of $4 million related to our international operations during the second quarter of 2015. excluding these items from 2015, adjusted operating losses would have increased by $53 million. this increase in adjusted operating losses was primarily due to an increase in drug prescription costs associated with our pharmacy business, higher labor costs, increases in expenses related to our international expansion, an increase in
82
costs associated with the right to use intellectual property and an increase in general and administrative costs. the increase in adjusted operating losses was partially offset by an increase in net revenue in our pharmacy business, primarily from additional volume and increases in pharmaceutical rates.
corporate level charges debt expense. debt expense for 2016, 2015, and 2014 consisted of interest expense of approximately $394 million, $390 million, and $386 million, respectively, and amortization and accretion of debt discounts and premiums, amortization of deferred financing costs and amortization of interest rate cap agreements of approximately $20 million in 2016, $18 million in 2015 and $25 million in 2014. the increase in debt expense in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily related to an increase in our weighted average outstanding principal balances as a result of a full year of interest on our 5.0% senior notes, which were issued in april 2015, and an increase in our interest rate on the amortization of our cap agreements in the fourth quarter of 2016. our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2016 was 4.43% as compared to 4.42% in 2015.
the increase in debt expense in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily related to an increase in weighted average outstanding principal balances offset by lower weighted average interest rates as a result of the issuance of our 5.0% senior notes in april 2015, as well as the entry into a new credit agreement and the issuance of senior notes in june 2014. our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2015 was 4.42% as compared to 4.68% in 2014.
corporate administrative support. corporate administrative support consists primarily of labor, benefits and long-term incentive compensation costs, as well as professional fees for departments which provide support to all of our various operating lines of business. in 2016, it also included an adjustment to reduce receivables associated with the dmg acquisition escrow provision relating to income tax items of $31 million, as discussed below. these expenses are included in our consolidated general and administrative expenses.
in connection with the acquisition of dmg, we recorded receivables against the acquisition escrow balance to offset specific potential tax liabilities. certain of these potential tax liabilities expired, resulting in the reduction of these assets during 2016. this negatively impacted our corporate administrative support cost by $31 million. this cost was directly offset by a corresponding reduction in income tax expense due to the expiration of the corresponding tax liabilities.
corporate administrative support costs were approximately $45 million in 2016, which included the adjustment to reduce receivables associated with the dmg acquisition escrow provision relating to an income tax item of $31 million, as compared to $19 million in 2015. this increase of approximately $26 million in corporate administrative support costs is primarily attributable to the tax receivables related to the dmg acquisition escrow provision, as well as increases in labor and benefits, professional fees, and other general and administrative expenses. these increases were offset by a decrease in long-term incentive compensation, primarily due to reductions in ultimate expected pay-outs as well as the departure of a senior executive.
corporate administrative support costs were approximately $19 million in 2015, as compared to $13 million in 2014. the change of approximately $6 million in corporate administrative support costs was primarily attributable to an increase in labor and benefits and professional fees, offset by an increase in management fee allocations.
other income. other income was approximately $9 million in both 2016 and 2015, and $2 million in 2014, and consisted principally of interest income. other income in 2016 as compared to 2015 was flat, as short-term investment interest income increased but was offset by an increase in foreign currency transaction losses. other income increased in 2015 as compared to 2014 due to an increase in short-term investment interest income and a decrease in foreign currency transaction losses.
provision for income taxes. the provision for income taxes for 2016, 2015 and 2014 represented an effective annualized tax rate of 30.6%, 40.9% and 34.1% of income from continuing operations, respectively. the effective tax rate in 2016 was lower primarily due to the gain on the apac jv ownership changes, offset by goodwill impairment charges.
noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $153 million, $158 million and $140 million, respectively. the decrease in noncontrolling interests in 2016 was primarily due to the impairment of our vascular access reporting unit, which resulted in a decrease in noncontrolling interest of $8 million. the increase in noncontrolling interests expense in 2015 was primarily due to increases in the profitability of our dialysis-related joint ventures. the percentage of u.s. dialysis and related lab services net revenues generated from dialysis-related joint ventures was approximately 24%, 23% and 22% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
83
accounts receivable our accounts receivable balances at december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015 were $1.917 billion and $1.724 billion, respectively, representing approximately 49 days and 46 days of revenue, respectively, net of the allowance for uncollectible accounts. the increase in dso was primarily related to our u.s. dialysis and related lab services business, mainly as a result of improved cash collection performance in 2015 which we did not experience in 2016. our dso calculation is based on the current quarter's average revenues per day.
as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, our unreserved patient services accounts receivable balances more than six months old were approximately $252 million and $246 million, respectively, representing approximately 16% and 18% of our net patient and other services accounts receivable balances, respectively. there were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. less than 1% of our revenues are classified as patient pay. substantially all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors, as discussed above.
for receivables associated with our capitated health plans, the balances remain on the balance sheet for as long as the respective plan years are open, which varies by health plan, but is generally two years in length. the majority of our capitated health plans accounts receivable is three to six months old with collections occurring on a periodic basis throughout the duration of the corresponding plan year.
liquidity and capital resources available liquidity. as of december 31, 2016, our cash balance was $913 million and we also had approximately $310 million in short-term investments. we also had an undrawn revolving line of credit under our senior secured credit facilities totaling $1.0 billion, of which approximately $95.2 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. the remaining amount is unencumbered. in addition, dmg has an outstanding letter of credit of approximately $1.3 million that is secured by a certificate of deposit. we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity, operating cash flows and access to borrowings to fund our scheduled debt service payments and other obligations for the foreseeable future. our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings.
cash flow from operations during 2016 amounted to $2.0 billion compared with $1.6 billion for 2015. the increase in our operating cash flows in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to payments of $494 million, or $304 million after-tax, made in connection with the settlement of a private civil suit in 2015 and due to the timing of other working capital items, offset by an increase in our income tax payments and a slight increase in our cash interest payments. cash flow from operations in 2016 included cash interest payments of approximately $407 million and cash tax payments of $339 million. cash flow from operations in 2015 included cash interest payments of approximately $405 million and cash tax payments of $156 million.
non-operating cash outflows in 2016 included $829 million for capital asset expenditures, including $470 million for new center developments and relocations, and $359 million for maintenance and information technology. we also spent an additional $564 million for acquisitions. during 2016, we also received $1.3 billion from the maturity and sale of investments. however, these proceeds were principally used to repurchase other investments or to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. in addition, during 2016 we received $37 million associated with stock award exercises and other share issuances and related excess tax benefits. we also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $192 million, and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $48 million associated with new joint ventures and from additional equity contributions. we also repurchased a total of 16,649,090 shares of our common stock for $1.072 billion, or an average price of $64.41 per share. in addition, we settled $25 million in share repurchases related to 2015.
non-operating cash outflows in 2015 included $708 million for capital asset expenditures, including $381 million for new center developments and relocations and $327 million for maintenance and information technology. we also spent an additional $97 million for acquisitions. during 2015, we also received $1.6 billion from the maturity and sale of investments. however, these proceeds were principally used to repurchase other investments or to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. in addition, during 2015, we received $54 million associated with stock award exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits. we also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $175 million, and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $55 million associated with new joint ventures and from additional equity contributions. we also repurchased a total of 7,779,958 shares of our common stock for $575 million, or an average price of $73.96 per share, of which $25 million was unsettled at december 31, 2015.
on august 9, 2016, we entered into an amendment to our agreement to acquire colorado-based renal ventures limited, llc (renal ventures). as a result of the amended agreement, we will acquire a 100% interest in all 38 outpatient dialysis centers owned by renal ventures, including one new center under construction, and a 51% interest in one vascular access clinic. the purchase price will be approximately $360 million in cash subject to, among other things, adjustments for certain items such as working capital. the transaction is subject to approval by the federal trade commission (ftc) including hart-scott-rodino antitrust clearance. we
84
anticipate that we will be required by the ftc to divest some outpatient dialysis centers as a condition of the transaction. we currently expect the transaction to close in mid 2017.
during 2016, we opened 100 new u.s. dialysis centers, acquired a total of eight u.s. dialysis centers, merged five centers, added two centers which we operate under a management and administrative services agreement, terminated two management and administration services agreements, deconsolidated three centers which we now operate under management and administrative services agreements and closed four centers. outside the u.s., we acquired 21 dialysis centers and opened 15 new dialysis and hospital operated centers.
during 2016, our dmg business acquired three primary care physician practices including the acquisition of tec, and four private medical practices.
during 2015, we opened 72 new u.s. dialysis centers, acquired a total of six u.s. dialysis centers, sold one center, merged five centers, added two centers in which we operate under a management and administrative services agreement and closed two centers. outside the u.s., we acquired 21 dialysis centers, opened seven new dialysis and hospital operated centers, and terminated one management and administration services agreement.
during 2015, our dmg business acquired three family practices, one management services organization, two primary care practices, and six private medical practices.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, we made mandatory principal payments under our senior secured credit facilities totaling $63 million on term loan a and $35 million on term loan b. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we made mandatory principal payments under our senior secured credit facilities totaling $50 million on term loan a and $35 million on term loan b.
interest rate swap and cap agreements as of december 31, 2016, we maintain several interest rate cap agreements that were entered into in november 2014 with notional amounts totaling $3.5 billion. these previously forward cap agreements became effective september 30, 2016 and have the economic effect of capping the libor variable component of our interest rate at a maximum of 3.50% on an equivalent amount of our debt. these cap agreements expire on june 30, 2018. as of december 31, 2016, the total fair value of these cap agreements was an asset of approximately $0.1 million. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded a loss of $1.2 million in other comprehensive income due to a decrease in the unrealized fair value of these cap agreements.
as of december 31, 2016, we maintain several forward interest rate cap agreements that were entered into in october 2015 with notional amounts totaling $3.5 billion. these forward cap agreements will become effective june 29, 2018 and will have the economic effect of capping the libor variable component of our interest rate at a maximum of 3.50% on an equivalent amount of our debt. these cap agreements expire on june 30, 2020. as of december 31, 2016, the total fair value of these cap agreements was an asset of approximately $9.8 million. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded a loss of $4.0 million in other comprehensive income due to a decrease in the unrealized fair value of these forward cap agreements.
previously, we maintained several interest rate cap agreements with notional amounts totaling $2.7 billion on our term loan b debt. these agreements had the economic effect of capping the libor variable component of our interest rate at a maximum of 2.50% on an equivalent amount of our term loan b. these interest rate cap agreements expired september 30, 2016. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recognized debt expense of $1.8 million from these caps.
we also previously maintained several interest rate swap agreements. these agreements had the economic effect of modifying the libor variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our term loan a to fixed rates ranging from 0.49% to 0.52%. these interest rate swap agreements required monthly interest payments and expired september 30, 2016. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recognized debt expense of $0.3 million from these swaps and recorded a loss of $0.8 million in other comprehensive income due to a decrease in the unrealized fair value of these swap agreements.
other items as of december 31, 2016, the interest rate on our term loan b debt bears interest at libor plus an interest rate margin of 2.75%. term loan b is subject to interest rate caps, if libor should rise above 3.50%. term loan a bears interest at libor plus an interest rate margin of 1.75%. the capped portion of term loan a is $87.5 million. in addition, the uncapped portion of term loan a, which is subject to the variability of libor, is $775 million. interest rates on our senior notes are fixed by their terms.
our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the senior secured credit facilities was 3.68%, based on the current margins in effect of 1.75% for term loan a and 2.75% for term loan b, as of december 31, 2016.
85
as of december 31, 2016, our interest rates are fixed on approximately 53% of our total debt.
our overall weighted average effective interest rate during the year ended december 31, 2016 was 4.43% and as of december 31, 2016 was 4.52%.
as of december 31, 2016, we had undrawn revolving credit facilities totaling $1.0 billion of which approximately $95.2 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. in addition, we have approximately $1.3 million of committed letters of credit outstanding related to dmg which are backed by a certificate of deposit.
we believe that we will generate significant operating cash flows and will have sufficient liquidity to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations for the foreseeable future, including the next 12 months, under the terms of our debt agreements. our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recognized impairment charges of $189 million on goodwill and $17 million on other intangible assets of certain dmg reporting units based on assessments performed after circumstances indicated it had become more likely than not that the goodwill of certain dmg reporting units had become impaired. these circumstances included underperformance of the businesses in recent quarters, as well as changes in other market conditions, including government reimbursement cuts and our expected ability to mitigate them.
based on continuing developments at our dmg reporting units during 2016, including the medicare advantage final benchmark rates for 2017 announced on april 4, 2016, further changes in our expectations concerning future government reimbursement rates and our expected ability to mitigate them, as well as medical cost and utilization trends, underperformance of certain at-risk units in recent quarters and other market conditions, we performed additional goodwill impairment assessments for certain at-risk dmg reporting units during each of the first three quarters of 2016 and as of their november 1 annual assessment date.
in addition, during the quarter ended december 31, 2016, we determined that circumstances indicated it had become more likely than not that the goodwill of our vascular access reporting unit had become impaired. these circumstances included changes in future governmental reimbursement and our expected ability to mitigate them. specifically, on november 2, 2016, cms released the 2017 physician fee schedule final rule and the ambulatory surgical center payment final rule which reflected significant changes in reimbursement structure for this business unit. accordingly, we performed the required valuations to estimate the fair value of the net assets and implied goodwill of this reporting unit with the assistance of a third-party valuation firm.
as a result of the assessments described above, we have recognized the goodwill impairment charges below:

further reductions in reimbursement rates, increases in medical cost or utilization trends, or other significant adverse changes in expected future cash flows or valuation assumptions could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future for the following reporting units, which remain at risk of goodwill impairment:

(3)   potential impact on estimated fair value of an increase in discount rates of 100 basis points as of the latest assessment date.

there were no major changes in the business, prospects, or expected future results of these reporting units from their latest assessment date.
except as described above, none of our various other reporting units was considered at risk of goodwill impairment as of december 31, 2016. since the dates of our last annual goodwill impairment tests, there have been certain developments, events, changes in operating performance and other changes in key circumstances that have affected our businesses. however, except as further described above, these did not cause management to believe it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our other reporting units would be less than their respective carrying amount.
long-term incentive compensation long-term incentive program (ltip) compensation includes both stock-based awards (principally stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and performance stock units) as well as long-term performance-based cash awards. long-term incentive compensation expense, which was primarily general and administrative in nature, was attributed among our u.s. dialysis and related lab services business, dmg business, corporate administrative support, and the ancillary services and strategic initiatives.
our stock-based compensation awards are measured at their estimated fair values on the date of grant if settled in shares or at their estimated fair values at the end of each reporting period if settled in cash. the value of stock-based awards so measured is recognized as compensation expense on a cumulative straight-line basis over the vesting terms of the awards, adjusted for expected forfeitures.
during 2016, we granted approximately 1,280,034 stock-settled stock appreciation rights (ssars) with an aggregate grant-date fair value of $17.6 million and a weighted-average expected life of approximately 4.2 years and approximately 328,457 stock units with an aggregate grant-date fair value of $23.6 million and a weighted-average expected life of approximately 3.3 years. we also granted 9,600 cash-settled stock-based awards with an aggregate grant-date fair value of $0.2 million.
long-term incentive compensation costs of $73.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 decreased by approximately $57.3 million as compared to 2015. this decrease in long-term incentive compensation was primarily due to a cumulative revaluation of liability-based awards for reductions in estimated ultimate payouts, as well as the final vesting of a prior broad grant that is no longer contributing expense.
long-term incentive compensation costs of $130.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 increased by approximately $11.7 million as compared to 2014. this increase in long-term incentive compensation was primarily due to an increase in the value of ltip awards that contributed expense during this period and ltip award forfeitures realized at a lower rate than previously expected.
as of december 31, 2016, there was $93.0 million in total estimated but unrecognized long-term incentive compensation costs for ltip awards outstanding, including $59.0 million relating to stock-based awards under our equity compensation plans. we expect to recognize the performance-based cash component of these ltip costs over a weighted average remaining period of 1.0 year and the stock-based component of these ltip costs over a weighted average remaining period of 1.4 years.
87
for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we received $28.4 million, $45.7 million and $59.1 million, respectively, in actual tax benefits upon the exercise of stock awards. since the company issues stock-settled stock appreciation rights rather than stock options, it did not receive cash proceeds from stock option exercises during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
stock repurchases in 2016, we repurchased a total of 16,649,090 shares of our common stock for $1.072 billion, or an average price of $64.41 per share. in 2015, we repurchased 7,779,958 shares of our common stock for $575 million, or an average price of $73.96 per share. in 2014, we did not repurchase any of our common stock. we have not repurchased any additional shares of our common stock from january 1, 2017 through february 24, 2017.
on july 13, 2016, our board of directors approved a share repurchase authorization in the amount of approximately $1.241 billion. this share repurchase authorization is in addition to the $259 million remaining at that time under our board of directors' prior share repurchase authorization announced in april 2015. as a result of the above transactions, there was approximately $677 million available under our current board authorizations for additional share repurchases as of february 24, 2017. although our share repurchase authorizations have no expiration dates, we are subject to share repurchase limitations under the terms of our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes.
off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations in addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases and letters of credit, as well as potential obligations associated with our equity investments in nonconsolidated businesses and to dialysis centers that are wholly-owned by third parties. substantially all of our u.s. dialysis facilities are leased. we have potential obligations to purchase the noncontrolling interests held by third parties in several of our majority-owned joint ventures and other nonconsolidated entities. these obligations are in the form of put provisions and are exercisable at the third-party owners' discretion within specified periods as outlined in each specific put provision. if these put provisions were exercised, we would be required to purchase the third-party owners' equity interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow attributable to the equity interests put to us, which is intended to approximate fair value. the methodology we use to estimate the fair values of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions assumes the higher of either a liquidation value of net assets or an average multiple of earnings, based on historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators that can affect future results, as well as other factors. the estimated fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions is a critical accounting estimate that involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which the noncontrolling interests may ultimately be settled, which could vary significantly from our current estimates. the estimated fair values of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions can fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these noncontrolling interests obligations may be settled will vary significantly depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers' access to the capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non-dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third-party owners' equity interests. the amount of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions that employ a contractually predetermined multiple of earnings rather than fair value are immaterial. for additional information see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
we also have certain other potential commitments to provide operating capital to several dialysis centers that are wholly-owned by third parties or centers in which we own a noncontrolling equity interest as well as to physician-owned vascular access clinics or medical practices that we operate under management and administrative services agreements. we have certain other potential commitments related to service agreements of approximately $1.5 million.

we are committed to purchase a certain amount of our hemodialysis non-equipment product supplies, such as dialyzers, from baxter at fixed prices through 2018. our total expenditures for the year ended december 31, 2016 on such products were approximately 2% of our total u.s. dialysis and related lab services operating expenses.
in 2010, we entered into and subsequently extended an agreement with fmc to purchase a certain amount of dialysis equipment, parts and supplies from fmc through december 31, 2017. our total expenditures for the year ended december 31, 2016 on such products were approximately 2% of our total u.s. dialysis and related lab services operating expenses. the actual amount of purchases in future years from fmc will depend upon a number of factors, including the operating requirements of our centers, the number of centers we acquire, and growth of our existing centers.
in 2014, we entered in to an agreement with baxter healthcare corporation (baxter) that commits us to purchase a certain amount of hemodialysis non-equipment product supplies, such as dialyzers, at fixed prices through 2018. our total expenditures for the year ended december 31, 2016 on such products were approximately 2% of our total u.s. dialysis and related lab service operating expenses.
in january 2017, we entered into a six year sourcing and supply agreement with amgen that expires on december 31, 2022, replacing our prior agreement that was to expire in 2018. under the terms of the agreement we will purchase epo in amounts necessary to meet no less than 90% of our requirements for esas from amgen. the actual amount of epo that we will purchase will depend upon the amount of epo administered during dialysis as prescribed by physicians and the overall number of patients that we serve.
settlements of approximately $28 million of existing income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, penalties and other long-term tax liabilities, are excluded from the above table as reasonably reliable estimates of their timing cannot be made.
supplemental information concerning certain physician groups and unrestricted subsidiaries the following information is presented as supplemental data as required by the indentures governing our senior notes.
we provide services to certain physician groups that, while consolidated in our financial statements for financial reporting purposes, are not subsidiaries of or owned by us, do not constitute "subsidiaries" as defined in the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes, and do not guarantee those senior notes. in addition, we have entered into management agreements with these physician groups pursuant to which we receive management fees from the physician groups.
89
as of december 31, 2016, if these physician groups were not consolidated in our financial statements, our consolidated indebtedness would have been approximately $9.192 billion, our consolidated other liabilities (excluding indebtedness) would have been approximately $3.459 billion and our consolidated assets would have been approximately $18.313 billion. if these physician groups were not consolidated in our financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2016, our consolidated total net revenues (including approximately $737 million of management fees payable to us), consolidated operating income and consolidated net income would be reduced by approximately $1.350 billion, $53 million, and $32 million, respectively.
in addition, we own a 67% equity interest in california medical group insurance (cmgi), which is an unrestricted subsidiary as defined in the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes, and does not guarantee those senior notes. our equity interest in cmgi is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, meaning that, although cmgi is not consolidated in our financial statements for financial reporting purposes, our consolidated income statement reflects our pro rata share of cmgi's net income as equity investment income.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, excluding our equity investment income attributable to cmgi, our consolidated operating income and consolidated net income would be increased by approximately $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively. see note 28 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
contingencies the information in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements of this report is incorporated by reference in response to this item.
critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles. these accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, contingencies and temporary equity. all significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. actual results will generally differ from these estimates. changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on-going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and accounts receivable, impairments of goodwill or other long-lived assets, accounting for income taxes, quarterly and annual variable compensation accruals, consolidation of variable interest entities, purchase accounting valuation estimates, fair value estimates, stock-based compensation and medical liability claims are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates.
dialysis and related lab services revenue recognition and accounts receivable. there are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of dialysis and related lab services revenue that we recognize in a given reporting period. payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. in addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will ultimately be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters.
revenues associated with medicare and medicaid programs are recognized based on (a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g., 80% for medicare patients) and (b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (e.g., medicaid secondary coverage), the patient's commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. our dialysis related reimbursements from medicare are subject to certain variations under medicare's new single bundled payment rate system whereby our reimbursements can be adjusted for certain patient characteristics and certain other factors. our revenue recognition depends upon our ability to effectively capture, document and bill for medicare's base payment rate and these other factors. in addition, as a result of the potential range of variations that can occur in our dialysis-related reimbursements from medicare under the new single bundled payment rate system, our revenue recognition is now subject to a greater degree of estimating risk.
commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed-care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates; however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients covered under commercial healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non-contracted commercial healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience,
90
historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, a slowdown in collections, a reduction in the amounts that we expect to collect and regulatory compliance issues. determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our approximately 187,700 u.s. patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverage's that occur each month, requires complex, resource-intensive processes. collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years or longer after services are provided.
we generally expect our range of dialysis and related lab services revenues estimating risk to be within 1% of its revenue, which can represent as much as 5% of dialysis and related lab services' adjusted operating income. changes in estimates are reflected in the then-current financial statements based on on-going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses, and have not been significant.
lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received.
dmg revenue recognition. dmg revenues consist primarily of fees for medical services provided under capitated contracts with various health plans and under risk-sharing programs. revenues with respect to both professional and institutional capitation are recognized in the month in which enrollees are entitled to receive healthcare and are based on the number of enrollees selecting a dmg associated group physician employed or affiliated with one of dmg's medical group entities as their primary healthcare provider. capitation payments received for enrollees under medicare advantage plans are subject to retroactive adjustment depending upon certain clinical and demographic factors. we estimate the amount of current year adjustments in revenues during the first and second quarters of any given year and adjust our estimates during the third quarter upon receipt of payments from cms related to prior year. any difference between actual contract settlements and estimated revenues are recorded in the year of final settlement.
in addition, as compensation under dmg's various managed care-related agreements with hospitals, we are entitled to receive a percentage of the amount by which the institutional capitation revenue received from health plans exceeds institutional expenses, and any such risk-share amount to which we are entitled is recorded as dmg revenues. in addition, pursuant to such managed care-related agreements, dmg agrees to be responsible should the third party incur a deficit as a result of institutional expenses being in excess of institutional capitation revenue. as with global capitation, revenue with respect to professional capitation is reported in the month in which enrollees are entitled to receive healthcare. however, risk-share revenues (that is, the portion of the excess of institutional capitation revenue to which dmg is entitled less institutional expenses), in contrast, are based on the number of enrollees and significant estimating risk relating to institutional utilization and associated costs incurred by assigned health plan enrollees. the medical groups also receive other incentive payments from health plans based on specified performance and quality criteria and the amounts accrued when earned can be reasonably estimated. differences between actual contract settlements and estimated receivables and payables are recorded in the year of final settlement. in 2013, dmg obtained a restricted knox-keene license in california, which now permits dmg to enter into contracts with health plans allowing it to recognize revenue under global capitation arrangements for both professional and institutional services.
impairments of long-lived assets. we account for impairments of long-lived assets, which include property and equipment, equity investments in non-consolidated businesses, amortizable intangible assets, indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance. goodwill is not amortized, but is assessed for valuation impairment as circumstances warrant and at least annually. an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. impairment reviews on other long-lived assets are also performed at least annually and whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable.
such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, changes in reimbursement rates, or deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers or other operations. we use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. the computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value.
accounting for income taxes. our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous state and foreign jurisdictions. significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense. deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations, assumptions about the amount of future state, federal, and foreign pre-tax operating income
91
adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. the assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. the allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets.
variable compensation accruals. we estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate-specific and/or corporate financial and operating goals. our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses and other awards, including long-term incentive programs, are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final payment amount. actual results reflected in each fiscal quarter may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and/or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our board of directors, as applicable.
consolidation of variable interest entities. we rely on the operating activities of certain entities that we do not directly own or control, but over which we have indirect influence and of which we are considered the primary beneficiary. under accounting guidance applicable to variable interest entities, we have determined that these entities are to be included in our consolidated financial statements. the analyses upon which these determinations rest are complex, involve uncertainties, and require significant judgment on various matters, some of which could be subject to reasonable disagreement. while these determinations have a meaningful effect on the description and classification of various amounts in our consolidated financial statements, non-consolidation of these entities would not have had a material effect on our results of operations.
purchase accounting valuation estimates. we make various assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of tangible and intangible assets, liabilities, contingent earn-out consideration, noncontrolling interests and contractual as well as non-contractual contingencies associated with our acquisitions. these assumptions can have a material effect on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense and any contingent earn-out adjustments that will be recognized in the future.
fair value estimates. we have recorded certain assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests (temporary equity) subject to put provisions at fair value. the fasb defines fair value which is measured based upon certain valuation techniques that include inputs and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions. we have measured the fair values of our applicable assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions based upon certain market inputs and assumptions that are either observable or unobservable in determining fair values and have also classified these assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions into the appropriate fair value hierarchy levels. the fair value of our investments available for sale are based upon quoted market prices from active markets and the fair value of our swap and cap agreements were based upon valuation models utilizing the income approach and commonly accepted valuation techniques that use inputs from closing prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets as well as other relevant observable market inputs at quoted intervals such as current interest rates, forward yield curves, implied volatility and credit default swap pricing. the fair value of funds on deposit with third parties are based primarily on quoted close or bid market prices of the same or similar assets. the fair value of our contingent earn-out considerations were primarily based upon unobservable inputs including projected ebitda, the estimated probabilities of achieving other performance targets and the estimated probability of the earn-out payments being made by using option pricing techniques and simulation models of expected ebitda and operating income and other performance targets. for our noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions we have estimated the fair values based upon either the higher of a liquidation value of net assets or an average multiple of earnings based on historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators that can affect future results, as well as other factors. the estimate of the fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which the noncontrolling interests may ultimately be settled, which could vary significantly from our current estimates. the estimated fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions can also fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these noncontrolling interests obligations may be settled will vary depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers' access to the capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non-dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third-party owners' equity interests.
stock-based compensation. stock-based compensation awards are measured at their estimated fair values on the date of grant if settled in shares or at their estimated fair values at the end of each reporting period if settled in cash. the value of stock-based awards so measured is recognized as compensation expense on a cumulative straight-line basis over the vesting terms of the awards, adjusted for expected forfeitures. we estimate the fair value of stock awards using complex option pricing models that rely heavily on estimates from us about uncertain future events, including the expected term of the awards, the expected future volatility of our stock price, and expected future risk-free interest rates.
medical liability claims associated with dmg. the medical groups are responsible for the medical services that associated physicians and contracted hospitals provide to assigned hmo enrollees. we provide medical services to health plan enrollees through a network of contracted providers under sub-capitation and ffs arrangements, company-operated clinics and staff physicians. medical costs for professional and institutional services rendered by contracted providers are recorded as medical expenses and hospital
92
expenses, respectively, in the consolidated statements of income. costs for operating medical clinics, including the salaries of medical and non-medical personnel and support costs, are recorded in clinic support and other operating costs.
an estimate of amounts due to contracted physicians, hospitals, and other professional providers is included in medical payables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. medical claims payable include claims reported as of the balance sheet date and incurred but not reported (ibnr) estimates. such estimates are developed using actuarial methods and are based on many variables, including the utilization of healthcare services, historical payment patterns, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, changes in membership, and other factors. the estimation methods and the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated. many of the medical contracts are complex in nature and may be subject to differing interpretations regarding amounts due for the provision of various services. we engage a third-party actuary to assist in the evaluation of the estimated ibnr reserves. such differing interpretations may not come to light until a substantial period of time has passed following the contract implementation. any adjustments to reserves are reflected in current operations.
significant new accounting standards see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for information regarding certain recent accounting standards that have been issued by the fasb.

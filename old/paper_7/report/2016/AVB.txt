executive overview business description we develop, redevelop, acquire, own and operate multifamily apartment communities primarily in new england, the new york/new jersey metro area, the mid-atlantic, the pacific northwest, and northern and southern california. we focus on leading metropolitan areas that we believe are characterized by growing employment in high wage sectors of the economy, lower housing affordability and a diverse and vibrant quality of life. we believe these market characteristics offer the opportunity for superior risk-adjusted returns on apartment community investments relative to other markets that do not have these characteristics. we seek to create long-term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms; deploying that capital to develop, redevelop and acquire apartment communities in our selected markets; operating apartment communities; and selling communities when they no longer meet our long-term investment strategy or when pricing is attractive.
our strategic vision is to be the leading apartment company in select us markets, providing a range of distinctive living experiences that customers value. we pursue this vision by targeting what we believe are among the best markets and submarkets, leveraging our strategic capabilities in market research and consumer insight and being disciplined in our capital allocation and balance sheet management. our communities are predominately upscale and generally command among the highest rents in their markets. however, we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points, consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services. we regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets.
financial highlights for the year ended december 31, 2016, net income attributable to common stockholders was $1,034,002,000, an increase of $291,964,000, or 39.3%, over the prior year. the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in noi from newly developed, acquired and existing operating communities and an increase in real estate sales and related gains. these amounts were partially offset by increases in depreciation and interest expense and a loss on extinguishment of debt in the current year, coupled with a gain on extinguishment of debt in the prior year.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, established communities noi increased by $49,606,000, or 4.8%, over the prior year. the increase was driven by an increase in rental revenue of 4.3%, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of 3.1% over 2015.
during 2016, we raised approximately $1,668,474,000 of gross capital through the issuance of unsecured notes and the sale of real estate, exclusive of proceeds from the disposition of joint ventures and secured debt assumed in conjunction with acquisitions. the funds raised from the sale of real estate consist of the proceeds from the sale of seven operating communities, one land parcel and ancillary real estate. we believe that our current capital structure will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms.
we believe our development activity will continue to create long-term value. during 2016, we completed the construction of eight communities containing an aggregate of 1,715 apartment homes for an aggregate total capitalized cost of $510,800,000. we also started the construction of nine communities containing an aggregate of 2,732 apartment homes, which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of $1,588,600,000, including our share of the total capitalized cost for one community being developed within a joint venture in which we own a 55.0% interest. in addition, during 2016 we completed the redevelopment of 10 communities containing an aggregate of 2,739 apartment homes for a total investment of $115,900,000, excluding costs incurred prior to the redevelopment.

during the year ended december 31, 2016, we sold seven wholly-owned operating communities, containing an aggregate of 2,051 apartment homes, for an aggregate sales price of $522,850,000, resulting in an aggregate gain in accordance with gaap of $370,301,000. we also sold other real estate, primarily composed of one land parcel which was sold to a joint venture in which we own a 55.0% interest, and ancillary real estate, for an aggregate sales price $41,178,000, resulting in an aggregate gain in accordance with gaap of $10,224,000.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, we acquired five communities containing an aggregate of 1,265 apartment homes and 40,000 square feet of retail space for an aggregate purchase price of $532,350,000. one community, avalon clarendon, was a mixed-use development originally acquired through a joint venture. we established separate legal ownership of the residential and retail, office and public parking components of the venture with our venture partner, and as a result consolidated avalon clarendon, reporting the operating results of the community as part of our consolidated operations beginning in october 2016. in conjunction with the acquisition of avalon hoboken, we assumed a fixed rate secured mortgage note with a principal balance of $67,904,000 and a contractual interest rate of 4.18% maturing in december 2020. in conjunction with the acquisition of avalon columbia pike, we assumed a fixed rate secured mortgage note with a principal balance of $70,507,000 and a contractual interest rate of 3.38% maturing in november 2019.
we believe that our balance sheet strength, as measured by our current level of indebtedness, our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges, and our current moderate use of financial encumbrances (such as secured financing) provide us with adequate access to liquidity from the capital markets. we expect to be able to meet our reasonably foreseeable liquidity needs, as they arise, through a combination of one or more of the following sources: existing cash on hand; operating cash flows; borrowings under our credit facility; secured debt; the issuance of corporate securities (which could include unsecured debt, preferred equity and/or common equity); the sale of apartment communities; or through the formation of joint ventures. see the discussion under liquidity and capital resources.
communities overview as of december 31, 2016 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 285 apartment communities containing 83,667 apartment homes in 10 states and the district of columbia, of which 27 communities were under development and four communities were under redevelopment. of these communities, 16 were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes, including three owned by subsidiaries of fund ii, seven owned by the u.s. fund, three owned by the ac jv and one that is being developed within a joint venture. in addition, we held a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional 25 wholly-owned communities that, if developed as expected, will contain an estimated 8,487 apartment homes.
our real estate investments consist primarily of current communities, development communities and development rights. our current communities are further distinguished as established communities, other stabilized communities, lease-up communities, redevelopment communities and unconsolidated communities.
established communities are generally consolidated communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy as of the beginning of the prior year, allowing for a meaningful comparison of operating results between years. other stabilized communities are generally all other completed consolidated communities that have stabilized occupancy during the current year. lease-up communities are consolidated communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and stabilized occupancy has not been achieved. redevelopment communities are consolidated communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. unconsolidated communities are communities that we have an indirect ownership interest in through our investment interest in an unconsolidated joint venture. a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note 8, "segment reporting," of our consolidated financial statements.
although each of these categories is important to our business, we generally evaluate overall operating, industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities, for which a detailed discussion can be found in "results of operations" as part of our discussion of overall operating results. we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition, disposition, development, redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized, redevelopment and development communities. discussions related to current and future cash needs and financing activities can be found under liquidity and capital resources.

noi of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance. noi is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets, our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs. our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed, redeveloped and acquired apartment communities.
results of operations our year-over-year operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and is reflected in changes in noi of our established communities; noi derived from acquisitions and development completions; the loss of noi related to disposed communities; and capital market and financing activity. a comparison of our operating results for 2016, 2015 and 2014 follows (dollars in thousands):

net income attributable to common stockholders increased $291,964,000, or 39.3%, to $1,034,002,000 in 2016 primarily due to an increase in noi from newly developed, acquired and existing operating communities and an increase in real estate sales and related gains. these amounts were partially offset by increases in depreciation and interest expense, and a loss on extinguishment of debt in the current year coupled with a gain on extinguishment of debt in the prior year. net income attributable to common stockholders increased $58,471,000, or 8.6%, to $742,038,000 in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to an increase in noi from newly developed and existing operating communities, and gains from net insurance recoveries and the extinguishment of debt, partially offset by a decrease in equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities.
noi is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level or financing-related costs. noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets. in addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead as a result of acquiring real estate, noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses (including property taxes), and excluding corporate-level income (including management, development and other fees), corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses, investments and investment management expenses, expensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries, interest expense, net, loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, net, general and administrative expense, equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities, depreciation expense, corporate income tax expense, casualty and impairment (gain) loss, net, gain on sale of real estate assets, gain on sale of discontinued operations, income from discontinued operations and net operating income from real estate assets sold or held for sale, not classified as discontinued operations.
noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap, and noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities, as determined by gaap, as a measure of liquidity, nor is noi indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. reconciliations of noi for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 to net income for each year are as follows (dollars in thousands):

_________________________________
(1)   noi for the year ended december 31, 2016 includes $20,306 in business interruption insurance proceeds related to the edgewater casualty loss.
the increase in our established communities' noi in 2016 and 2015 is due to increased rental rates, partially offset by decreased economic occupancy and increased operating expenses.
rental and other income increased in both 2016 and 2015 compared to the prior years due to additional rental income generated from newly developed, acquired and existing operating communities and an increase in rental rates at our established communities. the increase for 2016 is also due to business interruption insurance proceeds received due to the final settlement of the edgewater casualty loss.
consolidated communities-the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes for consolidated communities increased to 67,849 apartment homes for 2016, as compared to 64,211 homes for 2015 and 61,686 homes for 2014. the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to $2,476 for 2016 as compared to $2,388 in 2015 and $2,254 in 2014.
established communities-rental revenue increased $64,206,000, or 4.3%, to $1,541,034,000 for 2016 from $1,476,828,000 in the prior year. the increase is due to an increase in average rental rates of 4.4% to $2,450 per apartment home, partially offset by a decrease in economic occupancy of 0.1% to 95.5%. rental revenue increased $66,136,000, or 5.0%, for 2015, as compared to the prior year. economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community's gross revenue. economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss, as a percentage of gross potential revenue. gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents.
we experienced increases in rental revenue for all of our established communities' regions in 2016 as compared to the prior year, as discussed in more detail below.
the metro new york/new jersey region accounted for approximately 24.5% of the established community rental revenue for 2016 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 2.9% for 2016 over the prior year. average rental rates increased 2.8% to $2,972 per apartment home, and economic occupancy increased 0.1% to 95.7% for 2016 as compared to 2015. while new york city is absorbing a larger pipeline of new apartment deliveries, suburban markets surrounding the city are more insulated from this new competition, and we expect to see continued growth over the prior year in the metro new york/new jersey region in 2017.
the northern california region accounted for approximately 20.7% of the established community rental revenue for 2016 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 6.7% for 2016 over the prior year. average rental rates increased 6.9% to $2,795 per apartment home, and were partially offset by a 0.2% decrease in economic occupancy to 95.2% for 2016 as compared to 2015. we expect slower job growth and elevated levels of new apartment deliveries will temper growth in 2017 relative to prior years.
the southern california region accounted for approximately 18.9% of the established community rental revenue for 2016 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 6.3% for 2016 over the prior year. average rental rates increased 6.5% to $2,111 per apartment home, and were partially offset by a 0.2% decrease in economic occupancy to 95.6% for 2016 as compared to 2015. southern california has seen steady job growth and limited new apartment supply, which we expect will continue to support favorable operating results in 2017.
39
the new england region accounted for approximately 15.5% of the established community rental revenue for 2016 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 3.4% for 2016 over the prior year. average rental rates increased 3.6% to $2,314 per apartment home, and were partially offset by a 0.2% decrease in economic occupancy to 95.6% for 2016 as compared to 2015. stable job growth in the boston metro area is expected to support apartment demand in 2017. the fairfield market continues to experience moderate economic growth due to the area's greater exposure to the financial services sector, which has experienced slower job growth during this recovery than other industries.
the mid-atlantic region accounted for approximately 15.2% of the established community rental revenue for 2016 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 1.7% for 2016 over the prior year. average rental rates increased 2.0% to $2,134 per apartment home, and were partially offset by a 0.3% decrease in economic occupancy to 95.3% for 2016 as compared to 2015. although new apartment supply will remain elevated, accelerating job growth is expected to support modest growth in 2017.
the pacific northwest region accounted for approximately 5.2% of the established community rental revenue for 2016 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 6.3% for 2016 over the prior year. average rental rates increased 6.2% to $2,168 per apartment home, and economic occupancy increased 0.1% to 94.9% for 2016 as compared to 2015. we believe healthy job growth will continue to support favorable operating results in 2017.
management, development and other fees decreased $4,348,000 or 43.7%, and $1,103,000, or 10.0%, in 2016 and 2015, respectively, as compared to the prior years. the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower property and asset management fees earned as a result of dispositions from fund ii and the u.s. fund, as well as asset management and disposition fees earned in the prior year not present in 2016 from the residual jv. the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to lower property and asset management fees earned as a result of dispositions from fund i and fund ii, partially offset by an increase in disposition fees in 2015 related to the sale of communities owned within the residual jv.
direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes increased $29,260,000, or 7.8%, and $31,471,000, or 9.1%, in 2016 and 2015, respectively, as compared to the prior years. the increases in 2016 and 2015 were primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities. the increase for 2016 was partially offset by a decrease in snow removal and other costs related to the severe winter storms in our northeast markets that occurred during the first quarter of 2015, which contributed to the increase in the prior year.
for established communities, direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes, increased $7,256,000, or 2.5%, and $8,207,000, or 3.1%, in 2016 and 2015, respectively, as compared to the prior years. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to increased bad debt expense, compensation and community repairs and maintenance costs, partially offset by decreased utility costs and a decrease in snow removal and other costs related to the severe winter storms in our northeast markets that occurred during the first quarter of 2015. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to increased repairs and maintenance costs, payroll and benefit costs, and insurance costs, as well as snow removal and other costs related to the severe winter storms in our northeast markets during the first quarter of 2015.
property taxes increased $11,338,000, or 5.9%, and $14,865,000, or 8.3%, in 2016 and 2015, respectively, as compared to the prior years. the increases in 2016 and 2015 were primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities, increased assessments across our portfolio and successful appeals and reductions of supplemental taxes in the respective prior years in excess of those recognized in the then current year.
for established communities, property taxes increased $6,616,000, or 4.4%, and $3,829,000, or 2.8%, in 2016 and 2015, respectively, as compared to the prior years. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to increased assessments as well as appeals and supplemental tax reversals in the prior year in excess of those recognized in the current year. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to successful appeals and reductions of supplemental taxes in 2014 in excess of those in 2015, related primarily to our west coast markets. for communities in california, property tax changes are determined by the change in the california consumer price index, with increases limited by law (proposition 13). massachusetts also has laws in place to limit property tax increases. we evaluate property tax increases internally and also engage third-party consultants to assist in our evaluations. we appeal property tax increases when appropriate.
corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses decreased $22,000 in 2016, and increased $6,719,000, or 11.1%, in 2015, as compared to the prior years. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to an increase in compensation related costs including certain employee separation costs.
40
expensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries primarily reflect the costs incurred related to our asset investment activity, abandoned pursuit costs, which include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development, as well as the abandonment of development rights, acquisition pursuits and disposition pursuits, offset by any recoveries associated with acquisitions for periods prior to our ownership. these costs can be volatile, particularly in periods of increased acquisition activity, periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital, and the costs may vary significantly from period to period. these costs increased $3,100,000, or 45.4%, and $10,539,000 in 2016 and 2015, respectively, as compared to the prior years. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to costs related to five operating communities acquired in 2016, as well as the non-cash write-off of asset management fee intangibles associated with the disposition of communities in the u.s. fund. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to receipts in 2014 related to communities acquired as part of the archstone acquisition for periods prior to our ownership, which are primarily comprised of property tax and mortgage insurance refunds, as well as increased costs associated with the acquisition of real estate and abandonment of pursuits, as compared to the prior year.
interest expense, net increased $11,895,000, or 6.8%, and decreased $5,003,000, or 2.8%, in 2016 and 2015, respectively, as compared to the prior years. this category includes interest costs offset by capitalized interest pertaining to development and redevelopment activity, amortization of premium/discount on debt, and interest income. the increase in 2016 was due to an increase in outstanding unsecured indebtedness from net issuance activity in 2015 and 2016, as well as an increase in variable interest rates. the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to the repayment of secured indebtedness in 2015 and increased capitalized interest as a result of our increased development activity, partially offset by an increase in outstanding unsecured indebtedness resulting from the issuance of $875,000,000 aggregate principal amount during 2015.
loss (gain) on the extinguishment of debt, net reflects prepayment penalties, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and premiums from our debt repurchase and retirement activity, or payments to acquire our outstanding debt at amounts above or below the carrying basis of the debt acquired, excluding costs related to debt secured by assets sold or held for sale. the loss of $7,075,000 for 2016 was primarily due to the prepayment penalty associated with the early repayment of $250,000,000 principal amount of 5.70% coupon unsecured notes and the non-cash write-off of deferred financing costs for the variable rate debt secured by avalon walnut creek. the gain of $26,736,000 for 2015 was primarily due to the write-off of unamortized mark to market adjustments, net of unamortized deferred financing costs and any applicable related prepayment penalties associated with the early repayment of certain debt assumed as part of the archstone acquisition.
depreciation expense increased $53,511,000, or 11.2%, and $35,241,000, or 8.0%, in 2016 and 2015, respectively, as compared to the prior years. the increases in 2016 and 2015 were primarily due to the addition of newly developed apartment communities. the increase in 2016 was also due to the addition of newly acquired apartment communities.
general and administrative expense ("g&a") increased $2,997,000, or 7.0%, and $1,349,000, or 3.3%, in 2016 and 2015, respectively, as compared to the prior years. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in legal and consulting fees, as well as increased charitable contributions over the prior year. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to legal settlement proceeds received in 2014 not present in 2015, partially offset by a decrease in compensation expense, including severance, in 2015 as compared to the prior year.
casualty and impairment (gain) loss, net for 2016 consists of property damage insurance proceeds from the final insurance settlement for the edgewater casualty loss and net third-party insurance proceeds related to severe winter storms that occurred in 2015 in our northeast markets, partially offset by impairment charges recognized for ancillary land parcels. casualty and impairment (gain) loss, net for 2015 consists of edgewater insurance proceeds received, partially offset by (i) incident and demolition expenses and the write-off of the net book value of the fixed assets destroyed in the fire at edgewater, (ii) property and casualty damages incurred across several communities in our northeast markets related to severe winter storms, and (iii) an impairment charge recognized for a parcel of land sold during 2015.
equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities decreased $5,056,000, or 7.2%, and $78,748,000, or 52.9%, in 2016 and 2015, respectively, as compared to the prior years. the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to decreased noi from the ventures due to disposition activity in 2015 and 2016, as well as amounts received in 2015 for avalon at mission bay ii, discussed below, partially offset by increased gains from dispositions in 2016. the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to both gains on, and our promoted interests from, the sale of communities in various ventures, including avalon chrystie place, in 2014 in excess of gains on dispositions in 2015. the decrease in 2015 was partially offset by amounts received related to the modification of the joint venture agreement for the entity that owns avalon at mission bay ii to eliminate our promoted interest in future distributions, as well as the settlement of outstanding legal claims and net gains on the sales of communities in various ventures.
41
gain on sale of communities increased in 2016 and 2015 as compared to the prior years. the amount of gain realized in a given period depends on many factors, including the number of communities sold, the size and carrying value of the communities sold and the market conditions in the local area. prior to our adoption of asu 2014-08 as of january 1, 2014, gain on sale of communities was presented in gain on sale of discontinued operations. the gain of $374,623,000 in 2016 was primarily due to gains on the sale of seven wholly-owned operating communities, and the gain of $115,625,000 in 2015 was due to gains on the sale of three wholly-owned operating communities.
gain on sale of other real estate increased in 2016 and 2015 as compared to the prior years. the gain of $10,224,000 in 2016 was primarily composed of the gain on the land we sold to an unconsolidated joint venture. the gain of $9,647,000 in 2015 was a result of the gain on sale of air rights, representing the right to increase density for future residential development, and two undeveloped land parcels.
income tax expense decreased by $1,178,000 in 2016 and by $7,885,000 in 2015, as compared to the prior years. the decreases in 2016 and 2015 were primarily due to the timing of federal income tax expense amounts related to dispositions of our direct and indirect interests in certain real estate assets acquired in the archstone acquisition, which were owned through a taxable reit subsidiary.
income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by real estate sold and qualifying as discontinued operations during the period from january 1, 2014 through december 31, 2016. income from discontinued operations decreased in 2015, as compared to the prior year due to the change in accounting guidance for discontinued operations as discussed above.
gain on sale of discontinued operations decreased in 2015 as compared to the prior year. after our adoption of asu 2014-08 as of january 1, 2014, gain on sale of communities is presented separately from gain on sale of discontinued operations.
liquidity and capital resources we employ a disciplined approach to our liquidity and capital management. when we source capital, we take into account both our view of the most cost effective alternative then available and our desire to maintain a balance sheet that provides us with flexibility. our principal short-term liquidity needs are to fund:
•   development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged;
•   the minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our reit qualification under the code;
•   debt service and principal payments either at maturity or opportunistically before maturity; and
•   normal recurring operating expenses and corporate overhead expenses.
factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations, financing activities and investing activities (including dispositions) as well as general economic and market conditions. operating cash flow has historically been determined by: (i) the number of apartment homes currently owned, (ii) rental rates, (iii) occupancy levels and (iv) operating expenses with respect to apartment homes. the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage, as well as our plans for development, redevelopment, acquisition and disposition activity, are affected by changes in the capital markets environment, such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost-effective capital. we regularly review our liquidity needs, the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs.
we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $214,994,000 at december 31, 2016, a decrease of $185,513,000 from $400,507,000 at december 31, 2015. the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report.
operating activities-net cash provided by operating activities increased to $1,143,484,000 in 2016 from $1,056,754,000 in 2015. the change was driven primarily by increased noi from existing and newly developed and acquired communities and the receipt of business interruption insurance proceeds.
investing activities-net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,037,352,000 in 2016. the net cash used was primarily due to:
•   investment of $1,201,026,000 in the development and redevelopment of communities;
•   acquisition of five operating communities for $393,316,000, which includes the assumption of outstanding secured indebtedness with a par value of $138,411,000; and
•   capital expenditures of $72,852,000 for our operating communities and non-real estate assets.
42
these amounts are partially offset by:
•   proceeds from dispositions of $532,717,000; and
•   net distributions from unconsolidated real estate entities of $101,848,000.
financing activities-net cash used in financing activities totaled $291,645,000 in 2016. the net cash used was primarily due to:
•   payment of cash dividends in the amount of $726,749,000;
•   repayment of unsecured notes in the amount of $504,403,000; and
•   repayment of secured notes in the amount of $165,012,000.
these amounts are partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of unsecured notes in the aggregate amount of $1,122,488,000.
variable rate unsecured credit facility in january 2016, we extended the maturity of the credit facility from april 2017 to april 2020, and amended other provisions in the credit facility. in addition, pursuant to an option available under the terms of the credit facility, with the approval of the syndicate of lenders, we increased the aggregate facility size from $1,300,000,000 to $1,500,000,000 (the "credit facility increase"). we may further extend the term for up to nine months, provided we are not in default and upon payment of a $1,500,000 extension fee. in connection with the credit facility increase, the applicable margin over reference rates used to determine the applicable interest rates on our borrowings from time to time decreased. the credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate ("libor"), rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us. the current stated pricing is libor plus 0.825% per annum (1.60% at january 31, 2017 assuming a one month borrowing rate). the stated spread over libor can vary from libor plus 0.80% to libor plus 1.55% based on our credit ratings. in addition, a competitive bid option is available for borrowings up to 65% of the credit facility amount, which allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to make loans at a rate that is lower than the stated rate if market conditions allow. in connection with the credit facility increase, the annual facility fee was also amended to lower the fee to 0.125% from 0.15%, resulting in a fee of approximately $1,875,000 annually based on the $1,500,000,000 facility size and based on our current credit rating.
we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and had $45,321,000 outstanding in letters of credit that reduced our borrowing capacity as of january 31, 2017.
financial covenants we are subject to financial and other covenants contained in the credit facility, the term loan and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued. the principal financial covenants include the following:
•   limitations on the amount of total and secured debt in relation to our overall capital structure;
•   limitations on the amount of our unsecured debt relative to the undepreciated basis of real estate assets that are not encumbered by property-specific financing; and
•   minimum levels of debt service coverage.
we were in compliance with these covenants at december 31, 2016.
in addition, our secured borrowings may include yield maintenance, defeasance, or prepayment penalty provisions, which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity. these provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured.
43
continuous equity offering program in december 2015, we commenced a fourth continuous equity program ("cep iv") under which we may sell up to $1,000,000,000 of our common stock from time to time. actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined, including market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding. in conjunction with cep iv, we engaged sales agents who will receive compensation of up to 2.0% of the gross sales price for shares sold. cep iv also allows us to enter into forward sale agreements up to $1,000,000,000 in aggregate sales price of our common stock. we expect that we will physically settle each forward sale agreement on one or more dates prior to the maturity date of that particular forward sale agreement, in which case we will expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares underlying the particular forward agreement multiplied by the relevant forward sale price. however, we may also elect to cash settle or net share settle a forward sale agreement. in connection with each forward sale agreement, we will pay the relevant forward seller, in the form of a reduced initial forward sale price, commission of up to 2.0% of the sales prices of all borrowed shares of common stock sold. as of december 31, 2016, we had no sales under the program and had not entered into any forward sale agreements. as of january 31, 2017, we had $1,000,000,000 of shares remaining authorized for issuance under this program.
forward interest rate swap agreements during 2015 and 2016, we entered into $1,200,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2016 and 2017. during 2016, we settled $400,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements in conjunction with the may 2016 unsecured notes issuance, making a payment of $14,847,000. at maturity of the remaining outstanding forward interest rate swap agreements, we expect to cash settle the contracts and either pay or receive cash for the then current fair value. assuming that we issue the debt as expected, the impact from settling these positions will then be recognized over the life of the issued debt as a yield adjustment.
future financing and capital needs-debt maturities one of our principal long-term liquidity needs is the repayment of long-term debt at maturity.  for both our unsecured and secured notes, a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity. early retirement of our unsecured or secured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment. if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, it will be necessary for us to refinance or otherwise provide liquidity to satisfy the debt at maturity. this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings, equity issuances, additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities or borrowings under our credit facility. although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or, if available, that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory.

future financing and capital needs-portfolio and capital markets activity in 2017, we expect to meet our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources, including (i) real estate dispositions, (ii) cash balances on hand as well as cash generated from our operating activities, (iii) borrowing capacity under our credit facility and (iv) secured and unsecured debt financings. additional sources of liquidity in 2017 may include the issuance of common and preferred equity. our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or short-term financial prospects.
before beginning new construction or reconstruction activity, including activity related to communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures, we intend to plan adequate financing to complete these undertakings, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. in the event that financing cannot be obtained, we may have to abandon development rights, write off associated pre-development costs that were capitalized and/or forego reconstruction activity. in such instances, we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred.
from time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets. we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity. we may also use joint ventures related to mixed-use land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture. each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement. we cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures.
in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets, we sell assets that do not meet our long-term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities. because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets that we develop, redevelop or acquire, the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income, but reduce future total revenues, total expenses and noi until such time as the proceeds have been redeployed into revenue generating assets. we believe that the temporary absence of future cash flows from communities sold will not have a material impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs.

unconsolidated real estate investments and off-balance sheet arrangements unconsolidated investments fund ii was established to engage in a real estate acquisition program through a discretionary investment fund. we believe this investment format provides the following attributes: (i) third-party joint venture equity as an additional source of financing to expand and diversify our portfolio; (ii) additional sources of income in the form of property management and asset management fees and, potentially, incentive distributions if the performance exceeds certain thresholds; and (iii) additional visibility into the transactions occurring in multifamily assets that helps us with other investment decisions related to our wholly-owned portfolio.
fund ii has six institutional investors, including us. one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner of fund ii and, excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of fund ii, we have an equity investment of $19,737,000 (net of distributions), representing a 31.3% combined general partner and limited partner equity interest. upon achievement of a threshold return, we have a right to incentive distributions for our promoted interest representing the first 20.0% of further fund ii distributions, which are in addition to our share of the remaining 80.0% of distributions. during 2016, we recognized income of $7,985,000 for our promoted interest. fund ii served as the exclusive vehicle for acquiring apartment communities from its formation in 2008 through the close of its investment period in august 2011. fund ii has a term that expires in august 2020, assuming the exercise of two, one-year extension options.
during 2016, fund ii sold three communities containing an aggregate of 1,514 apartment homes for an aggregate sales price of $382,950,000. our share of the total gain in accordance with gaap was $41,501,000. in conjunction with the disposition of these communities, fund ii repaid $156,248,000 of related secured indebtedness in advance of the scheduled maturity dates, which resulted in charges for prepayment penalties and write-offs of deferred financing costs, of which our portion was $1,768,000.
the u.s. fund has six institutional investors, including us. we are the general partner of the u.s. fund and, excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of the u.s. fund, we have an equity investment of $49,693,000 (net of distributions), representing a 28.6% combined equity interest. the u.s. fund was formed in july 2011 and is fully invested. the u.s. fund has a term that expires in july 2023, assuming the exercise of two, one-year extension options.
during 2016, the u.s. fund sold two communities containing an aggregate of 461 apartment homes for an aggregate sales price of $229,300,000. our share of the total gain in accordance with gaap was $16,568,000. in conjunction with the disposition of these communities, the u.s. fund repaid $94,822,000 of related secured indebtedness in advance of the scheduled maturity dates, which resulted in charges for prepayment penalties and write-offs of deferred financing costs, of which our portion was $2,003,000.
the ac jv has four institutional investors, including us. excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of the ac jv, we have an equity investment of $50,674,000 (net of distributions), representing a 20.0% equity interest. the ac jv was formed in 2011.
during 2016, we entered into a joint venture to develop, own, and operate ava north point, an apartment community located in cambridge, ma, which is currently under construction and expected to contain 265 apartment homes upon completion. we own a 55.0% interest in the venture, and the venture partner owns the remaining 45.0% interest. ava north point is the third phase of a master planned development, the other phases of which are owned through the ac jv. during 2016, we provided the partners of the ac jv the opportunity to acquire the ava north point land parcel we owned as required in the rofo provisions for the ac jv. after certain partners of the ac jv declined to participate, we entered into the new joint venture and sold the land parcel to the venture in exchange for a cash payment and a capital account credit, and we are overseeing the development in exchange for a developer fee. upon sale of the land parcel, we recognized a gain of $10,621,000.
in may 2016, we entered into a joint venture agreement to facilitate the acquisition of avalon clarendon, located in arlington, va. avalon clarendon is part of a mixed-use development containing residential, retail, office and public parking. we contributed $120,300,000 to the venture for our share of the purchase price. we had shared control of the overall venture, but had all of the rights and obligations associated with the residential component of avalon clarendon, containing 300 apartment homes. the joint venture partner had all of the rights and obligations associated with the retail, office and public parking components of the mixed-use development. during september 2016, we established separate legal ownership of the residential and retail, office and public parking components of the venture with our venture partner, and we retained all of the rights and obligations associated with the residential component. after this legal separation, beginning october 2016, we began reporting the operating results of avalon clarendon as part of our consolidated operations. in conjunction with the consolidation of avalon clarendon, we recorded the consolidated assets at fair value, resulting in a gain of $4,322,000 for the difference between the fair value of avalon clarendon and our equity interest at the date of consolidation of $115,848,000, primarily attributable to depreciation recognized during the period the community was owned in the joint venture.
49
as part of the archstone acquisition we entered into a limited liability company agreement with equity residential, through which we assumed obligations of archstone in the form of preferred interests, some of which are governed by tax protection arrangements (the "legacy jv"). we have a 40.0% interest in the legacy jv. during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the legacy jv redeemed certain of the preferred interests and paid accrued dividends, of which our portion was $1,960,000, $14,410,000 and $6,300,000, respectively. at december 31, 2016, the remaining preferred interests had an aggregate liquidation value of $39,921,000, our share of which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets presented elsewhere in this report.
as of december 31, 2016, we had investments in the following unconsolidated real estate accounted for under the equity method of accounting excluding development joint ventures. refer to note 5, "investments in real estate entities," of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, which includes information on the aggregate assets, liabilities and equity, as well as operating results, and our proportionate share of their operating results. for ventures holding operating apartment communities as of december 31, 2016, detail of the real estate and associated funding underlying our unconsolidated investments is presented in the following table (dollars in thousands).

off-balance sheet arrangements in addition to our investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities, we have certain off-balance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest. additional discussion of these entities can be found in note 5, "investments in real estate entities," of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
we have not guaranteed the debt of our unconsolidated real estate entities, as referenced in the table above, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the unconsolidated real estate entities be unable to do so. in the future, in the event the unconsolidated real estate entities were unable to meet their obligations under a loan, we cannot predict at this time whether we would provide any voluntary support, or take any other action, as any such action would depend on a variety of factors, including the amount of support required and the possibility that such support could enhance the return of the unconsolidated real estate entities and/or our returns by providing time for performance to improve.
with respect to fund ii, each individual mortgage loan was made to a special purpose, single asset subsidiary of fund ii. each mortgage loan provides that it is the obligation of the respective subsidiary only, except under exceptional circumstances (such as fraud or misapplication of funds) in which case fund ii could also have obligations with respect to the mortgage loan. in no event do the mortgage loans provide for recourse against investors in fund ii, including against us or our wholly-owned subsidiaries that invest in fund ii. a default by fund ii or a fund ii subsidiary on any loan to it would not constitute a default under any of our loans or any loans of our other non-fund subsidiaries or affiliates. if fund ii or a subsidiary of fund ii were unable to meet its obligations under a loan, the value of our investment in fund ii would likely decline.  if a fund ii subsidiary or fund ii were unable to meet its obligations under a loan, we and/or the other investors might evaluate whether it was in our respective interests to voluntarily support fund ii through additional equity contributions and/or take other actions to avoid a default under a loan or the consequences of a default (such as foreclosure of a fund ii asset).
there are no other material lines of credit, side agreements, financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us. in evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage, management takes into consideration our proportionate share of the indebtedness of unconsolidated entities in which we have an interest.

inflation and deflation substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less. in an inflationary environment, this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. short-term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effect of inflation, although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents. similarly, in a deflationary rent environment, we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter-term leases.

federal income tax law changes and updates the following discussion updates the disclosures under "federal income tax considerations and consequences of your investment" in the prospectus dated february 19, 2015 contained in our registration statement on form s-3 filed with the sec on february 19, 2015.
the discussion in the last sentence under "federal income tax considerations and consequences of your investment-other u.s. federal income tax withholding and reporting requirements" on page 61 is replaced with the following sentence: ''withholding under this legislation will apply after december 31, 2018 with respect to the gross proceeds of a disposition of property that can produce u.s. source interest or dividends and currently applies with respect to other withholdable payments.''
the discussion under "federal income tax considerations and consequences of your investment-taxation of avalonbay as a reit-ownership of partnership interests by a reit" on page 47 is supplemented by inserting the paragraph below at the end of that subsection:
under the code, a partnership that is not treated as a corporation under the publicly traded partnership rules generally is not subject to u.s. federal income tax; instead, each partner is allocated its distributive share of the partnership's items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit and is required to take such items into account in determining the partner's income. however, a recent law change enacted under the bipartisan budget act of 2015, effective for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017, requires the partnership to pay the hypothetical increase in partner-level taxes (including interest and penalties) resulting from an adjustment of partnership tax items on audit or in other tax proceedings, unless the partnership elects an alternative method under which the taxes resulting from the adjustment (and interest and penalties) are assessed at the partner level. many uncertainties remain as to the application of these rules, including the application of the alternative method to partners that are reits, and the impact they will have on us. however, it is possible, that partnerships in which we invest may be subject to u.s. federal income tax, interest and penalties in the event of a u.s. federal income tax audit as a result of these law changes.
recent legislation modifies several of the reit rules discussed in the prospectus. the "protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015" (the "act") was enacted on december 18, 2015 and contains several provisions pertaining to reit qualification and taxation. some of these implicate certain tax-related disclosure contained in the prospectus and are briefly summarized below:
•   for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2015, the act expands the exclusion of certain hedging income from the reit gross income tests to include income from hedges of previously acquired hedges that a reit entered to manage risk associated with liabilities or property that have been extinguished or disposed.
•   for taxable years beginning before january 1, 2018, no more than 25% of the value of our assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries. for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017, the act reduces this limit to 20%. at this time, the securities we own in our taxable reit subsidiaries do not, in the aggregate, exceed 20% of the total value of our assets.
•   for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2015, for purposes of the reit asset tests, the act provides that debt instruments issued by publicly offered reits will constitute "real estate assets." however, unless such a debt instrument is secured by a mortgage or otherwise would have qualified as a real estate asset under prior law, (i) interest income and gain from such a debt instrument is not qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test and (ii) all such debt instruments may represent no more than 25% of the value of our total assets.
•   for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2015, certain obligations secured by a mortgage on both real property and personal property will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset and give rise to qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test if the fair market value of such personal property does not exceed 15% of the total fair market value of all such property.
•   a 100% excise tax is imposed on "redetermined trs service income," which is income of a taxable reit subsidiary attributable to services provided to, or on behalf of its associated reit and which would otherwise be increased on distribution, apportionment, or allocation under section 482 of the code.
•   for distributions made in taxable years beginning after december 31, 2014, the preferential dividend rules no longer to apply to us.
52
•   additional exceptions to the rules under the foreign investment in real property act ("firpta") were introduced for non-u.s. persons that constitute "qualified shareholders" (within the meaning of section 897(k)(3) of the code) or "qualified foreign pension funds" (within the meaning of section 897(l)(2) of the code).
•   after february 16, 2016, the firpta withholding rate under section 1445 of the code for dispositions of u.s. real property interests is increased from 10% to 15%.
•   the act increases from 5% to 10% the maximum stock ownership of the reit that a non-u.s. shareholder may hold to avail itself of the firpta exception for shares regularly traded on an established securities market.
•   for assets we acquired from a c corporation in a carry-over basis transaction, the act, in conjunction with recently promulgated treasury regulations, reduces the recognition period during which we could be subject to corporate tax on any built-in gains recognized on the sale of such assets from 10 years to 5 years.
forward-looking statements this form 10-k contains "forward-looking statements" as that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. you can identify forward-looking statements by our use of the words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "assume," "project," "plan," "may," "shall," "will" and other similar expressions in this form 10-k, that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters. these statements include, among other things, statements regarding our intent, belief or expectations with respect to:
•   our potential development, redevelopment, acquisition or disposition of communities;
•   the timing and cost of completion of apartment communities under construction, reconstruction, development or redevelopment;
•   the timing of lease-up, occupancy and stabilization of apartment communities;
•   the pursuit of land on which we are considering future development;
•   the anticipated operating performance of our communities;
•   cost, yield, revenue, noi and earnings estimates;
•   our declaration or payment of distributions;
•   our joint venture and discretionary fund activities;
•   our policies regarding investments, indebtedness, acquisitions, dispositions, financings and other matters;
•   our qualification as a reit under the internal revenue code;
•   the real estate markets in northern and southern california and markets in selected states in the mid-atlantic, new england, metro new york/new jersey and pacific northwest regions of the united states and in general;
•   the availability of debt and equity financing;
•   interest rates;
•   general economic conditions including the potential impacts from current economic conditions;
•   trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations; and
•   the impact of legal proceedings relating to the edgewater casualty loss and related matters, including liability to third parties resulting therefrom.
we cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements; rather, these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed. we do not undertake a duty to update these forward-looking statements, and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report. you should not rely on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. these risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. you should carefully review the discussion under item 1a. "risk factors" in this report for further discussion of risks associated with forward-looking statements.
some of the factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following:
•   we may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability to reach agreements with third parties to obtain land at attractive prices or to obtain desired zoning and other local approvals;
•   we may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions which make development less desirable, increases in costs of development, increases in the cost of capital or lack of capital availability, resulting in losses;
53
•   construction costs of a community may exceed our original estimates;
•   we may not complete construction and lease-up of communities under development or redevelopment on schedule, resulting in increased interest costs and construction costs and a decrease in our expected rental revenues;
•   occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by competition and local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control;
•   financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and our cash flows from operations and access to cost effective capital may be insufficient for the development of our pipeline which could limit our pursuit of opportunities;
•   our cash flows may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness;
•   we may be unsuccessful in our management of fund ii, the u.s. fund, the ac jv or the reit vehicles that are used with each respective joint venture;
•   we may be unsuccessful in managing changes in our portfolio composition; and
•   our expectations, estimates and assumptions as of the date of this filing regarding the outcome of investigations and/or legal proceedings resulting from the edgewater casualty loss, are subject to change.
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. a discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in note 1, "organization, basis of presentation and significant accounting policies," of our consolidated financial statements.
principles of consolidation we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets. we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting.
we determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements, applying the applicable accounting guidance. for investment interests that we do not consolidate, we evaluate the guidance to determine the accounting framework to apply. the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment. therefore, we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate.
if we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method, excluding the residual jv, at december 31, 2016, our assets would have increased by $827,020,000 and our liabilities would have increased by $706,110,000. we would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed, including but not limited to the following reasons, none of which are currently expected to occur:
•   for entities not considered to be variable interest entities, the nature of the entity changed such that it would be considered a variable interest entity and we were considered the primary beneficiary.
•   for entities in which we do not hold a controlling voting and/or variable interest, the contractual arrangement changed resulting in our investment interest being either a controlling voting and/or variable interest.
we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs.
54
cost capitalization we capitalize costs during the development of assets. capitalization begins when we determine that development of a future asset is probable and continues until the asset, or a portion of the asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use. for redevelopment efforts, we capitalize costs either (i) in advance of taking apartment homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun and continue until the redevelopment is completed, or (ii) when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment and continue until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident. rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial lease-up or post-redevelopment lease-up period are fully recognized in earnings as they accrue. we defer external costs associated with originating new leases, recognizing the impact of these costs in earnings over the term of the lease.
during the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities. these costs include interest and related loan fees, property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs. interest is capitalized for any project-specific financing, as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects. indirect project costs, which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts, are also capitalized. capitalized indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities are comprised primarily of compensation related costs for associates dedicated to our development and redevelopment efforts and total $45,201,000, $43,943,000 and $37,433,000 for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and, as such, we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate.
there may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity. if changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, there may be an increase in our operating expenses. for example, if in 2016 our development activities decreased by 10%, and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs, our costs charged to expense would have increased by $4,520,000.
we capitalize pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of development rights. these costs include legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs. future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and availability of capital. pre-development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. in addition, if the status of a development right changes, making future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are written off with a charge to expense.
due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community, and therefore should be capitalized, the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate. if we had determined that 10% of our capitalized pursuit costs were associated with development rights that were no longer probable of occurring, net income for the year ended december 31, 2016 would have decreased by $4,018,000.
abandoned pursuit costs & asset impairment we evaluate our real estate and other long-lived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist. if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. if the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. we assess land held for development for impairment if our intent changes with respect to the development of the land. we evaluate our unconsolidated investments for impairment, considering both the carrying value of the investment, estimated to be the expected proceeds that it would receive if the entity were dissolved and the net assets were liquidated, as well as our proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments.
we expense costs related to abandoned pursuits, which include the abandonment of development rights and disposition pursuits. these costs can vary greatly, and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years.
our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate and/or capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development. we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed, or the likelihood of any future impairment charges, if any. you should also review item 1a. "risk factors" in this form 10-k.
55
reit status we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated, for federal income tax purposes, as a reit. we elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code for the year ended december 31, 1994 and have not revoked such election. a corporate reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders. as a reit, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute 100% of our taxable income to our stockholders over time periods allowed under the code. if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates (subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to elect to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years. for example, if we failed to qualify as a reit in 2016, our net income would have decreased by approximately $415,669,000.
our qualification as a reit requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment. therefore, we believe our reit status is a critical accounting estimate.
acquisition of investments in real estate the adoption of asu 2017-01, as discussed in note 1, "organization, basis of presentation and significant accounting policies," of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report, has impacted our accounting framework for the acquisition of investments in real estate. prior to adoption of asu 2017-01 on october 1, 2016, we accounted for acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with the authoritative guidance for the initial measurement, which required the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to be recognized at fair value. typical assets and liabilities acquired include land, buildings, furniture, fixtures and equipment and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above or below market leases and in-place leases. in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilized various sources, including our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. consideration for acquisitions is typically in the form of cash unless otherwise disclosed. we expensed all costs incurred related to acquisitions of operating communities. subsequent to adoption of asu 2017-01, we assess each acquisition of an operating community to determine if it meets the definition of a business or if it qualifies as an asset acquisition. we expect that acquisitions of individual operating communities will generally be viewed as asset acquisitions, and result in the capitalization of acquisition costs, and the allocation of purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the relative fair value of the respective assets and liabilities.

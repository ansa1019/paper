item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
business and overview overview we are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotels and timeshare properties in 122 countries and territories under 30 brand names. we also develop, operate, and market residential properties and provide services to home/condominium owner associations. under our business model, we typically manage or franchise hotels, rather than own them. we group our operations into three business segments: north american full-service, north american limited-service, and international.
we earn base management fees and in many cases incentive management fees from the properties that we manage, and we earn franchise fees on the properties that others operate under franchise agreements with us. in most markets, base fees typically consist of a percentage of property-level revenue while incentive fees typically consist of a percentage of net house profit adjusted for a specified owner return. in the middle east and asia, incentive fees typically consist of a percentage of gross operating profit without adjustment for a specified owner return. net house profit is calculated as gross operating profit (house profit) less non-controllable expenses such as insurance, real estate taxes, and capital spending reserves.
our emphasis on long-term management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness, while adding new hotels to our system generates growth, typically with little or no investment by the company. this strategy has driven substantial growth while minimizing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry. in addition, we believe minimizing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling the investments that we do make maximizes and maintains our financial flexibility.
we remain focused on doing the things that we do well; that is, selling rooms, taking care of our guests, and making sure we control costs both at company-operated properties and at the corporate level ("above-property"). our brands remain strong as a result of skilled management teams, dedicated associates, superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, significant distribution, our loyalty programs, a multichannel reservations system, and desirable property amenities. we strive to effectively leverage our size and broad distribution.
we, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of new, refreshed, and reinvented properties, new room and public space designs, and enhanced amenities and technology offerings. we address, through various means, hotels in our system that do not meet standards. we continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary, information-rich, and easy-to-use websites, and of our associated mobile smartphone applications, through functionality and service improvements, and we expect to continue capturing an increasing proportion of property-level reservations via this cost-efficient channel.
our profitability, as well as that of owners and franchisees, has benefited from our approach to property-level and above-property productivity. properties in our system continue to maintain very tight cost controls. we also control above-property costs, some of which we allocate to hotels, by remaining focused on systems, processing, and support areas.

acquisition of starwood hotels & resorts worldwide on the merger date, we completed the starwood combination. our income statements reflect a net loss of $39 million for starwood's results of operations for the period from september 23, 2016 to december 31, 2016, including merger-related costs and charges, net of tax, of $194 million. the combination of our brands creates a more comprehensive portfolio, enhances our global market distribution, and provides opportunities for cost efficiencies. our combined company now operates or franchises over 6,000 properties with nearly 1.2 million rooms. see footnote 3 "acquisitions and dispositions" for more information.
performance measures we believe revenue per available room ("revpar"), which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available for the period, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. revpar may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. we also believe occupancy and average daily rate ("adr"), which are components of calculating revpar, are meaningful indicators of our performance. occupancy, which we calculate by dividing occupied rooms by total rooms available, measures the utilization of a property's available capacity. adr, which we calculate by dividing property room revenue by total rooms sold, measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels.
our revpar statistics for 2016, and for 2016 compared to 2015, include legacy-starwood comparable properties for both full years even though marriott did not own the legacy-starwood brands before the starwood combination. therefore, our revpar statistics include legacy-starwood properties for periods during which fees from the legacy-starwood properties are not included in our income statements. we provide these revpar statistics as an indicator of the performance of our brands and to allow for comparison to industry metrics, and they should not be viewed as necessarily correlating with our fee revenue. our revpar statistics for 2015, and for 2015 compared to 2014, are for legacy-marriott comparable properties only, as marriott did not own the legacy-starwood brands at any time during that two-year period. for the properties located in countries that use currencies other than the u.s. dollar, the comparisons to the prior year period are on a constant u.s. dollar basis. we calculate constant dollar statistics by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period.
we define our comparable properties as our properties, including those that we acquired through the starwood combination, that were open and operating under one of our legacy-marriott or legacy-starwood brands since the beginning of the last full calendar year (since january 1, 2015 for the current period), and have not, in either the current or previous year: (i) undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions, (ii) been converted between company-operated and franchised, or (iii) sustained substantial property damage or business interruption. for 2016 compared to 2015, we had 3,698 comparable north american properties (including 483 legacy-starwood properties) and 965 comparable international properties (including 506 legacy-starwood properties). for 2015 compared to 2014, we had 3,077 comparable north american properties and 367 comparable international properties.
we also believe company-operated house profit margin, which is the ratio of property-level gross operating profit to total property-level revenue, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property-level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. house profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. house profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses.
business trends our 2016 results reflected a year-over-year increase in the number of properties in our system, favorable demand for our brands in many markets around the world, and slow but steady economic growth. comparable worldwide systemwide revpar for 2016 increased 1.8 percent to $113.50, adr increased 1.0 percent on a constant dollar basis to $156.53, and occupancy increased 0.6 percentage points to 72.5 percent, compared to 2015.
in north america, 2016 lodging demand for our brands reflected increased transient business, driven by higher retail and government travel, but weaker premium-priced corporate transient demand. group business was higher in most of 2016 compared to 2015. revenue growth was constrained in certain markets by new lodging supply, weak demand from the oil and gas industries, the impact of the strong dollar on international travel to u.s. gateway markets, and moderate gdp growth. the 2017 group revenue pace for systemwide full-service hotels in north america was up more than two percent as of year-end 2016, compared to the 2016 group pace measured as of year-end 2015.

our europe region experienced higher demand in 2016 across most countries, led by spain, portugal and russia, partially constrained by weaker demand in france, belgium, and turkey following terrorism events in those countries. in our asia pacific region in 2016, revpar growth was strong in india and thailand, while revpar growth in china was constrained in hong kong and certain southern and tertiary china markets. middle east demand continued to be impacted by geopolitical instability, oversupply in dubai and qatar, and lower oil prices. in south africa, results were favorable in 2016, reflecting strong local demand and higher international tourism attracted by the weak south african rand. in the caribbean and latin america, growth from strong demand in mexico and the summer olympic games in rio de janeiro was offset by concerns relating to the zika virus in the caribbean and weak economic conditions in most markets in south america.
we monitor market conditions and provide the tools for our hotels to price rooms daily in accordance with individual property demand levels, generally adjusting room rates as demand changes. our hotels modify the mix of business to improve revenue as demand changes. for our company-operated properties, we continue to focus on enhancing property-level house profit margins and making productivity improvements.
compared to 2015, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins in 2016 increased by 50 basis points and worldwide comparable company-operated house profit per available room ("hp-par") increased by 2.7 percent on a constant u.s. dollar basis, reflecting higher occupancy, rate increases, improved productivity, and solid cost controls primarily at our legacy-marriott properties. north american company-operated house profit margins increased by 70 basis points, and hp-par at those properties increased by 4.4 percent. international company-operated house profit margins increased by 20 basis points, and hp-par at those properties increased by 0.7 percent compared to 2015.
system growth and pipeline in 2016, we added 348 properties with 55,321 rooms, in addition to the 1,342 properties and 381,440 rooms gained with the starwood combination on the merger date. approximately 40 percent of the added rooms are located outside north america, and 18 percent are conversions from competitor brands. of the rooms gained with the starwood combination, approximately 50 percent are located outside north america. in 2016, 34 properties (5,691 rooms) exited our system.
at the end of 2016, including rooms under legacy-starwood brands, we had more than 420,000 hotel rooms in our development pipeline, which includes hotel rooms under construction and under signed contracts, and nearly 34,000 hotel rooms approved for development but not yet under signed contracts. more than half of the rooms in our development pipeline are outside north america.
we believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth, as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements. nonetheless, our ability to develop and update our brands and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new marriott-branded properties, both of which are important parts of our growth plan, depend in part on capital access, availability and cost for other hotel developers and third-party owners. these growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. see the "forward-looking statements" and "risks and uncertainties" captions earlier in this report and the "liquidity and capital resources" caption later in this report.

brand statistics the following brand statistics for 2016, and for 2016 compared to 2015, include legacy-starwood comparable properties for both full years even though marriott did not own the legacy-starwood brands before the starwood combination. the statistics for 2015, and for 2015 compared to 2014, are for legacy-marriott comparable properties only, as marriott did not own the legacy-starwood brands at any time during that two-year period.
2016 compared to 2015. the following tables present revpar, occupancy, and adr for comparable properties under our legacy-marriott and legacy-starwood brands in north america and in our international regions. systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties, in addition to our company-operated properties.

the $5 million increase in base management fees for legacy-marriott operations primarily reflected the impact of stronger sales at existing properties ($22 million) and unit growth across our system ($15 million), partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($15 million), lower deferred fee recognition ($11 million), and lower fees from properties that converted from managed to franchised ($8 million).
30
the $48 million increase in franchise fees for legacy-marriott operations reflected the impact of unit growth across our system ($48 million), stronger sales at existing properties ($16 million), and higher fees from properties that converted from managed to franchised ($11 million), partially offset by lower relicensing fees ($22 million) and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($7 million).
the $34 million increase in incentive management fees for legacy-marriott operations reflected higher net house profit and unit growth, higher incentive fees earned from a few limited-service portfolios ($10 million), and higher deferred fee recognition ($8 million), partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($7 million).
in 2016, 69 percent of our legacy-marriott managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 68 percent in 2015. in north america, 65 percent of legacy-marriott managed properties paid incentive fees in 2016 compared to 63 percent in 2015. outside north america, 74 percent of legacy-marriott managed properties paid incentive fees in both 2016 and 2015, representing 48 percent of our total incentive management fees in 2016 from legacy-marriott managed properties compared to 51 percent of our total fees in 2015.
the $25 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue for legacy-marriott operations reflected $38 million of higher other revenue predominantly from branding fees, partially offset by $13 million of lower owned and leased revenue. the decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected lower revenues from properties that converted to managed ($60 million) and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($15 million), partially offset by improved sales from several properties following renovations ($29 million), stronger sales at other existing properties across our segments ($28 million), and favorable results at two new owned properties ($9 million).
cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer but also includes reimbursements for other costs, such as those associated with our loyalty programs, reservations, and marketing programs. as we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating or net income. the $568 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue for legacy-marriott operations reflected the impact of higher property occupancies, unit growth across our system, and growth in the marriott rewards program membership and activity.
2015 compared to 2014. the following discussion presents our analysis of our revenues for 2015 compared to 2014.

$14,486             $13,796                      $690
the $26 million increase in base management fees reflected stronger revpar ($29 million) and the impact of unit growth across our system ($25 million), partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($11 million), lower fees due to properties that converted from managed to franchised ($7 million), and decreased recognition of previously deferred fees ($8 million).
the $108 million increase in total franchise fees reflected the impact of unit growth across our system ($55 million), stronger revpar due to increased demand ($31 million), increased relicensing and application fees ($22 million), and higher fees from properties that converted to franchised from managed ($7 million), partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($7 million).
the $17 million increase in incentive management fees reflected higher revpar and house profit margins primarily at company-managed north american properties, particularly at a few large portfolios of managed hotels whose improved net house profits allowed them to reach their owners priority threshold and begin to record incentive fees. higher incentive fees also reflected the addition of hotels included in the delta hotels acquisition, partially offset by $15 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates and $7 million of lower incentive fees from properties under renovation.
in 2015, 68 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 50 percent in 2014. managed properties that paid incentive management fees in 2015 represented 63 percent of properties in north america and 74 percent outside of north america, compared to 36 percent in north america and 73 percent outside of north america in 2014. the
31
percentage of north american properties that paid incentive management fees to us increased compared to 2014 primarily due to a few large north american limited-service portfolios of properties that paid incentive management fees in 2015 but did not do so in 2014. in addition, in 2015, 51 percent of our incentive fees came from properties outside of north america versus 56 percent in 2014.
the $36 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue reflected $44 million of lower owned and leased revenue, partially offset by $8 million in higher other revenue predominantly from branding fees and hotel service programs that we acquired as part of our acquisition of protea hotels in the 2014 second quarter. lower owned and leased revenue reflected net weaker performance impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates, a decrease of $27 million attributable to properties that converted to managed or franchised or left our system, and $16 million net unfavorable impact of properties under renovation, partially offset by increases of $10 million from protea hotel leases we acquired in the 2014 second quarter and $6 million from the miami beach edition hotel, which opened in the 2014 fourth quarter and which we subsequently sold in the 2015 first quarter as discussed in footnote 3 "acquisitions and dispositions."
the $575 million increase in total cost reimbursements revenue reflected the impact of higher occupancies and growth across our system. in 2015, our managed rooms increased by 12,668 rooms and our franchised rooms increased by 31,883 rooms, net of rooms at hotels exiting our system.
operating income
2016 compared to 2015. operating income increased by $18 million to $1,368 million in 2016 from $1,350 million in 2015. the increase in operating income reflected a $349 million increase in fee revenue, which we discuss in the preceding "revenues" section, a $386 million increase in merger-related costs and charges which we discuss in footnote 4 "merger-related costs and charges," as well as the following changes. the table below presents the impact of the starwood combination starting from the merger date, with additional information on the factors attributable to our legacy-marriott brands discussed following the table.

owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses for legacy-marriott operations increased by $65 million. the increase was largely attributable to $39 million in higher branding fees and $25 million of higher owned and leased revenue, net of direct expenses. the $25 million of higher owned and leased revenue, net of direct expenses primarily reflected $17 million of net stronger performance at several properties following renovations, $15 million overall favorable results across our segments, and $4 million of lower pre-opening costs, partially offset by $10 million of lower profits from properties that converted from owned to managed.
depreciation, amortization, and other expense for legacy-marriott operations decreased by $14 million. the decrease primarily reflected a favorable variance to the 2015 impairment charges on the edition hotels ($12 million) and corporate equipment ($4 million).
general, administrative, and other expenses for legacy-marriott operations decreased by $9 million. the decrease primarily reflected $15 million in lower reserves for guarantee funding, and $9 million in lower foreign exchange losses, partially offset by $15 million of higher administrative costs to grow our brands globally, $4 million of higher bad debt reserves, and $3 million net unfavorable impact to our legal expenses associated with 2015 litigation resolutions.
32
2015 compared to 2014. operating income increased by $191 million to $1,350 million in 2015 from $1,159 million in 2014. the increase in operating income reflected a $151 million increase in fee revenue, which we discuss in the preceding "revenues" section, as well as the following changes.

the $6 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses was largely attributable to $4 million in higher branding fees. owned and leased revenue, net of direct expenses was unchanged as stronger results at several of our international properties, including $4 million of lower lease payments for properties that moved to managed, franchised, or left our system, were offset by $10 million of weaker performance due to renovations.
the $9 million decrease in depreciation, amortization, and other expense reflected a $25 million favorable variance to the 2014 impairment charge on the edition hotels, partially offset by the 2015 impairment charges of $6 million for the miami beach edition residences and $6 million for the new york (madison square park) edition and a $4 million impairment charge on corporate equipment.
the $25 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses largely reflected a $28 million net favorable impact to our legal expenses associated with litigation resolutions, $24 million of development costs that we deferred in 2015 related to our growing franchise pipeline, and $5 million in lower foreign exchange losses compared to the 2014 devaluation of assets denominated in venezuelan bolivars, partially offset by $20 million of higher costs incurred to grow our brands globally, $5 million of transaction costs related to the starwood combination, and $5 million from the delta hotels acquisition.

gains and other income, net for legacy-marriott operations decreased by $23 million primarily due to the net gain that we recorded in the prior year, which consisted of a $41 million gain on the redemption of a preferred equity ownership interest, partially offset by an $11 million disposal loss for an international property and a $4 million disposal loss for a north american limited-service segment plot of land.
interest expense for legacy-marriott operations, including interest expense on debt incurred for the starwood combination, increased by $52 million. the increase was primarily due to a net increase in senior notes interest expense ($18 million) from the issuances of series q through w notes in 2016 and series o and p notes in 2015, partially offset by the maturities of series h notes in 2016 and series g notes in 2015. the remaining increase is primarily due to the amortization of costs for a bridge term loan facility commitment that we obtained in the 2016 first quarter ($13 million), net lower capitalized interest primarily as a result of the completion of the new york (madison square park) edition in 2015 ($9 million), and higher interest rates on commercial paper borrowings ($7 million).
interest income for legacy-marriott operations increased by $4 million primarily due to higher interest income on a loan that we provided to an owner in conjunction with entering into a franchise agreement for a north american limited-service property in the 2015 fourth quarter ($8 million), partially offset by lower interest income on two repaid loans ($6 million).
equity in earnings for legacy-marriott operations decreased by $11 million primarily reflecting a net unfavorable variance to three adjustments recorded in 2015, which consisted of a reversal of a litigation reserve ($11 million) and a

reduction of an international investee's liabilities ($5 million), partially offset by an impairment charge on an international joint venture ($6 million).
provision for income taxes for legacy-marriott operations increased by $4 million primarily due to tax rate changes in several jurisdictions ($12 million), higher earnings from foreign operations ($6 million), and an unfavorable comparison to 2015 u.s. and foreign true-ups ($5 million), partially offset by lower u.s. earnings due to merger-related expenses ($11 million) and the release of a valuation allowance ($8 million).

gains and other income, net increased by $19 million. the increase primarily reflects the $41 million gain on the redemption of our preferred equity ownership interest. the increase was partially offset by an $11 million disposal loss for an international property and a $4 million expected disposal loss for a north american limited-service segment plot of land.
interest expense increased by $52 million. the increase was due to net lower capitalized interest expense as a result of the completion of the miami beach edition in the 2014 fourth quarter and the new york (madison square park) edition in the 2015 second quarter ($25 million), interest on the series o notes and series p notes that we issued in the 2015 third quarter and the series n notes that we issued in the 2014 fourth quarter ($17 million), and an unfavorable variance to the 2014 debt premium accretion true-up ($7 million).
interest income decreased by $1 million. this decrease was primarily due to lower interest income on the preferred equity ownership interest that was redeemed in the 2015 second quarter ($5 million), partially offset by higher interest income on the $85 million mezzanine loan (net of a $15 million discount) we provided to an owner in conjunction with entering into a franchise agreement for an international property in the 2014 second quarter ($5 million).
equity in earnings increased by $10 million. the increase reflects a $22 million year-over-year impact from the reversal in 2015 of an $11 million litigation reserve that was recorded in 2014 and associated with an equity investment and a $5 million benefit recorded in 2015 following an adjustment to an international investee's liabilities. the increase was partially offset by a $6 million impairment charge relating to an international joint venture and an unfavorable variance to a $9 million benefit recorded in 2014 for two of our international investments following the reversal of their liabilities associated with a tax law change in a country in which they operate.
our provision for income taxes increased by $61 million. the increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings and unfavorable comparisons to the 2014 resolution of a u.s. federal tax issue relating to a guest marketing program, the 2014 release of an international valuation allowance, and the 2014 resolution of an international financing activity tax issue. the increase was partially offset by a favorable irs settlement relating to share-based compensation ($12 million), a tax benefit from an international property disposition ($7 million), and a favorable comparison to the 2014 tax on unrealized foreign exchange gains that were taxed within a foreign jurisdiction ($5 million).

north american full-service
2016 compared to 2015
in 2016, across our north american full-service segment we added 424 properties (154,521 rooms), including 398 properties (147,623 rooms) from the starwood combination on the merger date, and two properties (213 rooms) left our system.
the table below presents the impact of the starwood combination starting from the merger date, with additional information on the factors attributable to our legacy-marriott brands discussed following the table.

the $106 million increase in segment profits for legacy-marriott operations was driven by $40 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, $37 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $17 million of higher incentive management fees, $11 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, $1 million of lower depreciation, amortization, and other expense, and $1 million of higher equity in earnings, partially offset by $1 million of lower gains and other income, net.
higher base management and franchise fees for legacy-marriott operations were primarily due to $30 million of stronger revpar and unit growth. increased incentive management fees for legacy-marriott operations were primarily driven by higher net house profits at managed hotels.
higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses for legacy-marriott operations primarily reflected $21 million of higher branding fees, $10 million of favorable operating results at several properties, and $6 million of lower pre-opening costs.
lower general, administrative, and other expenses for legacy-marriott operations were primarily due to $6 million of lower reserves for guarantee funding and $5 million of lower administrative costs.
cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our legacy-marriott north american full-service segment properties totaled $8,161 million in 2016, compared to $7,911 million in 2015.

in 2015, across our north american full-service segment we added 57 properties (15,345 rooms), including 37 properties (9,590 rooms) from the delta hotels acquisition, and five properties (1,398 rooms) left our system.
for the twelve months ended december 31, 2015, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2014, revpar for comparable systemwide north american full-service properties increased by 4.6 percent to $136.95, occupancy for these properties increased by 0.6 percentage points to 73.1 percent, and average daily rates increased by 3.8 percent to $187.40.
the $37 million increase in segment profits, compared to 2014, was driven by $44 million of higher base management and franchise fees and $10 million of higher incentive management fees, partially offset by $6 million of lower owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, $4 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses, $4 million of lower gains and other income, net, and $3 million of higher depreciation, amortization, and other expense.
base management and franchise fees were higher due to stronger revpar driven by rate and unit growth, partially offset by $5 million of contract modifications and terminations. increased incentive management fees were primarily driven by higher net house profits at managed hotels.
lower owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses primarily reflected $8 million of weaker performance at a north american full-service property under renovation.
37
general, administrative, and other expenses were higher due to $5 million from the delta hotels acquisition and $2 million in higher reserves for guarantee funding, partially offset by $3 million of other property expenses incurred in 2014.

north american limited-service
2016 compared to 2015
in 2016, across our north american limited-service segment we added 451 properties (60,637 rooms), including 226 properties (34,294 rooms) from the starwood combination on the merger date, and 8 properties (880 rooms) left our system.

the $38 million increase in segment profits for legacy-marriott operations, compared to 2015, reflected $14 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $10 million of higher incentive management fees, $5 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, $4 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, $3 million of higher gains and other income, net, and $2 million of lower depreciation, amortization, and other expense.
base management and franchise fees for legacy-marriott operations were higher primarily reflecting $50 million from new units and stronger revpar, partially offset by $24 million of lower relicensing fees and an $11 million decrease in deferred fee recognition. increased incentive management fees for legacy-marriott operations were primarily driven by $10 million of higher incentive fees earned from a few limited-service portfolios.
higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses primarily reflected higher net earnings at several leased and owned properties.
lower general, administrative, and other expenses for legacy-marriott operations were primarily due to $7 million of lower reserves for guarantee funding.
higher gains and other income, net for legacy-marriott operations primarily reflected a favorable variance to the $4 million prior year disposal loss for a north american limited-service segment plot of land.
cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our legacy-marriott north american limited-service segment properties totaled $2,646 million in 2016, compared to $2,366 million in 2015.

in 2015, across our north american limited-service segment we added 173 properties (19,712 rooms) and 26 properties (2,820 rooms) left our system. the majority of the properties that left our system were fairfield inn & suites and residence inn properties.
for the twelve months ended december 31, 2015, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2014, revpar for comparable systemwide north american limited-service properties increased by 5.6 percent to $94.99, occupancy for these properties increased by 0.5 percentage points to 74.4 percent, and average daily rates increased by 4.9 percent to $127.65.
the $77 million increase in segment profits, compared to 2014, reflected $73 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $13 million of higher incentive management fees, $2 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, and $1 million of lower depreciation, amortization, and other expense, partially offset by $5 million of lower owned,
38
leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, $4 million of lower gains and other income, net, and $3 million of lower equity in earnings.
base management and franchise fees were higher due to unit growth and stronger room rates, including $19 million of higher franchise licensing and application fees, partially offset by a $5 million reduction in previously deferred fees and $3 million of contract terminations. increased incentive management fees were primarily driven by a few large portfolios of managed hotels whose improved net house profits allowed them to reach their owners' priority threshold and begin to record incentive fees.
lower owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses primarily reflected $7 million of lower termination fees, partially offset by $3 million of higher net earnings at several leased properties.
gains and other income, net were lower due to a $4 million expected disposal loss on a plot of land. see footnote 3 "acquisitions and dispositions" for more information.
lower equity in earnings was driven by the redemption of our investment in an entity that owns two hotels.
cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our north american limited-service segment properties totaled $2,366 million in 2015, compared to $2,217 million in 2014.

the $4 million increase in segment profits for legacy-marriott operations, compared to 2015, consisted of $12 million of higher gains and other income, net, $7 million of higher incentive management fees, $1 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $1 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, and $1 million of higher equity in earnings, partially offset by $16 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses, and $2 million of higher depreciation, amortization, and other expense.
higher base management and franchise fees for legacy-marriott operations were due to $19 million of stronger revpar and unit growth, partially offset by the impact of $17 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates. the increase in incentive management fees for legacy-marriott operations was primarily due to an $8 million increase in deferred fee recognition and $5 million from new managed properties, partially offset by the impact of $7 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates.
higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses for legacy-marriott operations largely reflected $13 million net stronger performance at several properties following renovations, partially offset by $9 million from a property that converted from owned to managed.
higher general, administrative, and other expenses for legacy-marriott operations were primarily due to a $12 million increase in administrative costs to grow our brands globally and a $5 million increase in property expenses.
higher gains and other income, net for legacy-marriott operations was primarily due to an $11 million prior year disposal loss for an international property.
higher equity in earnings for legacy-marriott operations primarily reflected a net unfavorable variance to two adjustments recorded in 2015, which consisted of a reduction of an international investee's liabilities ($5 million) and an impairment charge on an international joint venture ($6 million).
cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our legacy-marriott international properties totaled $1,344 million in 2016, compared to $1,282 million in 2015.

the $3 million decrease in segment profits in 2015, compared to 2014, consisted of $12 million of lower gains and other income, net, $9 million of lower equity in earnings, $6 million of lower incentive management fees, and $4 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses, partially offset by $18 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $8 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, and $2 million of lower depreciation, amortization, and other expense.
base management and franchise fees increased due to stronger revpar, driven by both occupancy and rate, and unit growth, partially offset by the impact of $16 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates. lower incentive management fees reflected $15 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates, partially offset by higher net house profit at managed hotels and unit growth.
higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses largely reflected favorable operating results at several of our properties, including $4 million of lower lease payments for properties that moved to managed, franchised, or left our system, and $7 million of increased termination fees, partially offset by $4 million in lower branding fees and $2 million from a property that converted to managed.
lower depreciation, amortization, and other expense was driven by amortization true-ups and lower depreciation from an international property sold in 2015, partially offset by $5 million of higher depreciation at several of our leased properties.
general, administrative, and other expenses increased primarily due to higher costs for branding and service initiatives to grow our brands globally.
lower gains and other income, net primarily reflected an $11 million loss on the sale of an international property discussed in footnote 3 "acquisitions and dispositions."
lower equity in earnings reflected an unfavorable variance to a $9 million benefit recorded in 2014 for two of our international investments, following the reversal of their liabilities associated with a tax law change in a country in which they operate, and a $6 million impairment charge relating to an international joint venture, partially offset by a $5 million benefit recorded in 2015 following an adjustment to an international investee's liabilities.
cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our international properties totaled $1,282 million in 2015, compared to $1,305 million in 2014.
share-based compensation we award: (1) stock options to purchase our common stock; (2) stock appreciation rights ("sars") for our common stock; (3) restricted stock units ("rsus") of our common stock; and (4) deferred stock units. we also issue performance-based rsus ("psus") to named executive officers and some of their direct reports under their stock plan. see footnote 6 "share-based compensation" for more information.

liquidity and capital resources cash requirements and our credit facilities in the 2016 second quarter, we amended and restated our multicurrency revolving credit agreement (the "credit facility") to extend the maturity date of the credit facility and increase the aggregate amount of available borrowings to up to $4,000 million, up to $2,500 million of which was initially available, with the full $4,000 million becoming available to us with the closing of the starwood combination. the availability of the credit facility supports our commercial paper program and general corporate needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, letters of credit, and acquisitions. in addition, we used borrowings under the credit facility, all of which we later repaid, to finance part of the cash component of the consideration we paid to starwood shareholders and certain fees and expenses we incurred in connection with the starwood combination. borrowings under the credit facility generally bear interest at libor (the london interbank offered rate) plus a spread, based on our public debt rating. we also pay quarterly fees on the credit facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. the term of the facility expires on june 10, 2021.
the credit facility contains certain covenants, including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage (consisting of the ratio of adjusted total debt to consolidated earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda"), giving pro forma effect for certain material acquisitions, each as defined in the credit facility) to not more than 4 to 1. in connection with the starwood combination, we exercised our option to temporarily increase the maximum permitted leverage under the credit facility to 4.5 to 1 for the 2016 third and fourth quarters and the 2017 first quarter. our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. we currently satisfy the covenants in our credit facility and public debt instruments, including the leverage covenant under the credit facility, expect to continue to do so once the temporary increase in permitted leverage ends, and do not expect the covenants will restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels or increase those levels should we decide to do so in the future.
we believe the credit facility and our access to capital markets, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, remain adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, meet debt service, and fulfill other cash requirements.
we issue commercial paper in the united states. we do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper; therefore, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. we classify any outstanding commercial paper and credit facility borrowings as long-term based on our ability and intent to refinance them on a long-term basis. we reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature. we do not expect that fluctuations in the demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity, given our borrowing capacity under the credit facility.
at year-end 2016, our available borrowing capacity amounted to $2,545 million and reflected borrowing capacity of $1,687 million under our credit facility and our cash balance of $858 million. we calculated that borrowing capacity by taking $4,000 million of effective aggregate bank commitments under our credit facility and subtracting $2,313 million of outstanding commercial paper (there being no outstanding letters of credit under our credit facility).
we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. we expect to continue meeting part of our financing and liquidity needs primarily through commercial paper borrowings, issuances of senior notes, and access to long-term committed credit facilities. if conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate, or if disruptions in the capital markets take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of both the 2008 worldwide financial crisis and the events of september 11, 2001, we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facility, which we believe will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs, including repayment of debt obligations, but which may or may not carry a higher cost than commercial paper. since we continue to have ample flexibility under the credit facility's covenants, we expect that undrawn bank commitments under the credit facility will remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate markedly.

our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.7 to 1.0 at year-end 2016 and 0.4 to 1.0 at year-end 2015. we minimize working capital through cash management, strict credit-granting policies, and aggressive collection efforts. we also have significant borrowing capacity under our credit facility should we need additional working capital.
our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years, the calculations of which we detail in exhibit 12 to this 2016 annual report on form 10-k, are as follows:

capital expenditures and other investments. we made capital expenditures of $199 million in 2016, $305 million in 2015, and $411 million in 2014. these included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels, improvements to existing properties, and systems initiatives. capital expenditures in 2016 decreased by $106 million compared to 2015, primarily due to lower spending for our edition hotels. capital expenditures in 2015 decreased by $106 million compared to 2014, primarily related to the 2014 development of two edition hotels, partially offset by 2015 renovations at a north american full-service property and investments in our reservations system.
we expect 2017 investment spending will total approximately $500 million to $700 million, including approximately $175 million for maintenance capital spending. consolidated investment spending also includes other capital expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs, acquisitions, and equity and other investments.
over time, we have sold lodging properties, both completed and under development, subject to long-term management agreements. the ability of third-party purchasers to raise the debt and equity capital necessary to acquire such properties depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact of changes in capital market conditions on our business operations. in the starwood combination, we acquired various hotels and joint venture interests in hotels, which we have sold or may seek to sell. we also expect to continue making selective and opportunistic investments to add units to our lodging business, which may include new construction, loans, and noncontrolling equity investments.
fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on our overall business results because: (1) we own less than one percent of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure.
dispositions. property and asset sales generated $218 million cash proceeds in 2016 and $673 million in 2015. see footnote 3 "acquisitions and dispositions" for more information on completed dispositions and planned dispositions.
loan activity. from time to time, we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise. loan collections, net of loan advances, amounted to $35 million in 2016 compared to net collections of $26 million in 2015. at year-end 2016, we had $248 million of senior, mezzanine, and other loans ($245 million noncurrent and $3 million current) outstanding, compared to $221 million ($215 million noncurrent and $6 million current) outstanding at year-end 2015. our notes receivable balance for senior, mezzanine, and other loans increased by $27 million, primarily due to $65 million in loans acquired in the starwood combination on the merger date and loan advances of $32 million, partially offset by loan collections of $67 million.
42
equity and cost method investments. cash outflows of $14 million in 2016, $7 million in 2015, and $6 million in 2014 for equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in a number of joint ventures.
cash from financing activities debt. debt increased by $4,399 million in 2016, to $8,506 million at year-end 2016 from $4,107 million at year-end 2015, and primarily reflected $1,875 million from the starwood combination (much of which was subsequently canceled in exchange for our series s through w notes), $1,485 million ($1,500 million face amount) in series q and r notes issuances, and $1,373 million increase in commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by $289 million in series h notes that matured in the 2016 second quarter and $24 million of repurchased starwood senior notes in the 2016 fourth quarter. see footnote 11 "long-term debt" for additional information on the debt issuances.
our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt, and reducing our working capital. at year-end 2016, our long-term debt had an average interest rate of 2.9 percent and an average maturity of approximately 5.9 years. the ratio of our fixed-rate long-term debt to our total long-term debt was 0.7 to 1.0 at year-end 2016.
see the "cash requirements and our credit facilities," caption in this "liquidity and capital resources" section for more information on our credit facility.
share repurchases. we purchased 8 million shares of our common stock in 2016 at an average price of $71.55 per share, 25.7 million shares in 2015 at an average price of $75.48 per share, and 24.2 million shares in 2014 at an average price of $62.09 per share. at year-end 2016, 31.4 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our board of directors. we purchase shares in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions.
dividends. our board of directors declared and paid the following quarterly cash dividends in 2016: (1) $0.25 per share declared on february 11, 2016 and paid march 31, 2016 to shareholders of record on february 25, 2016; (2) $0.30 per share declared on may 6, 2016 and paid june 30, 2016 to shareholders of record on may 20, 2016; (3) $0.30 per share declared on september 13, 2016 and paid september 30, 2016 to shareholders of record on september 23, 2016; and (4) $0.30 per share declared november 10, 2016 and paid december 30, 2016 to shareholders of record on november 24, 2016. our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per share on february 10, 2017, payable on march 31, 2017 to shareholders of record on february 24, 2017.

the preceding table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits at year-end 2016 of $400 million, including interest and net of deferred tax assets. see footnote 7 "income taxes" for additional information.
in addition to the purchase obligations noted in the preceding table, in the normal course of business we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of the hotels that we manage. since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow.

for further information, including the nature of the commitments and their expirations, see the "commitments" caption in footnote 8 "commitments and contingencies."
letters of credit at year-end 2016, we also had $157 million of letters of credit outstanding (all outside the credit facility), the majority of which were for our self-insurance programs. surety bonds issued as of year-end 2016 totaled $149 million, the majority of which federal, state, and local governments requested in connection with our self-insurance programs.
related party transactions equity method investments we have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management and/or franchise services and receive fees. we also have equity method investments in entities that provide management and/or franchise services to hotels and receive fees. in addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity, or guarantees to these entities.
other related parties we provide management services for and receive fees from properties owned by jwm family enterprises, l.p., which is beneficially owned and controlled by j.w. marriott, jr., deborah marriott harrison, and other members of the marriott family.
for more information, including the impact to our financial statements of transactions with these related parties, see footnote 19 "related party transactions."
critical accounting policies and estimates our preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) we must make assumptions that were uncertain when the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or selection of a different estimate methodology could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
while we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available when the estimate or assumption was made. actual results may differ significantly. additionally, changes in our assumptions, estimates or assessments as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors, and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to those policies.
see footnote 2 "summary of significant accounting policies" for further information on our critical accounting policies and estimates, which are as follows:
loyalty programs, including how members earn points, how we estimate the value of future redemption obligation, and how we recognize revenue for these programs;
44
goodwill, including how we evaluate the fair value of reporting units and when we record an impairment loss on goodwill;
intangibles and long-lived assets, including how we evaluate the fair value of intangibles and long-lived assets and when we record impairment losses on intangibles and long-lived assets;
investments, including information on how we evaluate the fair value of investments and when we record impairment losses on investments;
loan loss reserves, including information on how we measure impairment on senior, mezzanine, and other loans of these types;
income taxes, including information on how we determine our current year amounts payable or refundable, as well as our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities; and business combinations, including the assumptions that we make to estimate the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to discount rates, royalty rates, and the amount and timing of future cash flows.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the "forward-looking statements," our consolidated financial statements and notes that follow and the "consolidated five-year summary of selected financial data" and the "risk factors" included in our annual report on form 10-k. references to "ameriprise financial," "ameriprise," the "company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to ameriprise financial, inc. exclusively, to our entire family of companies, or to one or more of our subsidiaries.
overview ameriprise financial is a diversified financial services company with a more than 120 year history of providing financial solutions. we offer a broad range of products and services designed to achieve the financial objectives of individual and institutional clients. we are america's leader in financial planning and a leading global financial institution with $787.4 billion in assets under management and administration as of december 31, 2016. for additional discussion of our businesses, see part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k.
the financial results from the businesses underlying our go-to-market approaches are reflected in our five operating segments:
•   advice &amp; wealth management;
•   asset management;
•   annuities;
•   protection; and
•   corporate &amp; other.
our operating segments are aligned with the financial solutions we offer to address our clients' needs. the products and services we provide retail clients and, to a lesser extent, institutional clients, are the primary source of our revenues and net income. revenues and net income are significantly affected by investment performance and the total value and composition of assets we manage and administer for our retail and institutional clients as well as the distribution fees we receive from other companies. these factors, in turn, are largely determined by overall investment market performance and the depth and breadth of our individual client relationships.
financial markets and macroeconomic conditions have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our operating and performance results. in addition, the business and regulatory environment in which we operate remains subject to elevated uncertainty and change. to succeed, we expect to continue focusing on our key strategic objectives. the success of these and other strategies may be affected by the factors discussed in item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k - "risk factors."
equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the "spread" income generated on our fixed annuities, fixed insurance, deposit products and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of deferred acquisition costs ("dac") and deferred sales inducement costs ("dsic") assets, the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.
earnings, as well as operating earnings, will continue to be negatively impacted by the ongoing low interest rate environment. in addition to continuing spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines, a sustained low interest rate environment may
42
result in increases to our reserves and changes in various rate assumptions we use to amortize dac and dsic, which may negatively impact our operating earnings. for additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see item 7a. "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."
in the third quarter of the year, we updated our market-related inputs and implemented model changes related to our living benefit valuation. in addition, we conducted our annual review of life insurance and annuity valuation assumptions relative to current experience and management expectations including modeling changes. these aforementioned changes are collectively referred to as unlocking. our unlocking process also includes premium deficiency testing for certain insurance products. the unfavorable unlocking impact of $219 million in the third quarter of 2016 primarily reflected continued low interest rates and higher persistency on living benefit contracts that more than offset benefits from persistency on annuity contracts without living benefits, an update to market-related inputs for our living benefit valuation and other model updates. our long-term interest rate assumption remains unchanged, but we extended the period it would take for rates to reach our long term level from 3.5 years to 5.5 years. in addition, our review of our closed long term care ("ltc") business in the third quarter of 2016 resulted in a loss recognition of $31 million due to continued low interest rates, higher morbidity and higher reinsurance expenses, slightly offset by premium increases. the $31 million is comprised of $58 million of amortization of dac and the release of the related deferred reinsurance liability of $27 million. the favorable unlocking impact of $48 million in the third quarter of 2015 primarily reflected improved policyholder behavior, an update to market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation and model changes that more than offset the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the low interest rate environment. our review of our ltc business in the third quarter of 2015 resulted in no loss recognition as better-than-expected premium increases, which were reflected in our projections, offset higher morbidity and lower interest rates. see our consolidated and segment results of operations sections below for the pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking and additional discussion of the drivers of the unlocking impact.
we consolidate certain variable interest entities for which we provide asset management services. these entities are defined as consolidated investment entities ("cies"). while the consolidation of the cies impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. effective january 1, 2016, we adopted asu 2015-02 - consolidation: amendments to the consolidation analysis ("asu 2015-02") and deconsolidated several collateralized loan obligations ("clos") and all previously consolidated property funds. see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the adoption impact. effective january 1, 2016, we no longer have net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily due to the deconsolidation of property funds. the results of operations of the cies are reflected in the corporate & other segment. on a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the cies and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities related to the cies, primarily syndicated loans and debt, are reflected in net investment income. we continue to include the fees from these entities in the management and financial advice fees line within our asset management segment. effective january 1, 2016, we adopted asu 2014-13 - consolidation: measuring the financial assets and the financial liabilities of a consolidated collateralized financing entity and elected the measurement alternative. as a result, the carrying value of the cie debt is set equal to the fair value of the cie assets; therefore the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities related to cies is nil. the cie debt held by ameriprise financial is eliminated in consolidation. see note 3 and note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
while our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), management believes that operating measures, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, net of the related dsic and dac amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges and the related dsic and dac amortization; the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges and the related dac amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; integration and restructuring charges; income (loss) from discontinued operations; and the impact of consolidating cies, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. management uses certain of these non-gaap measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. also, certain of these non-gaap measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. throughout our management's discussion and analysis, these non-gaap measures are referred to as operating measures. these non-gaap measures should not be viewed as a substitute for u.s. gaap measures.
it is management's priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets.
our financial targets are:
•   operating total net revenue growth of 6% to 8%,
•   operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and
•   operating return on equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("aoci") of 19% to 23%.

critical accounting estimates the accounting and reporting policies that we use affect our consolidated financial statements. certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and, in some cases, the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. the accounting and reporting policies and estimates we have identified as fundamental to a full understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition are described below. see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information about our accounting policies.
valuation of investments the most significant component of our investments is our available-for-sale securities, which we carry at fair value within our consolidated balance sheets. the fair value of our available-for-sale securities at december 31, 2016 was primarily obtained from third-party pricing sources. for a discussion on our accounting policies related to the valuation of our investments and other-than-temporary impairments, see note 2 and note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.
deferred acquisition costs we incur costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance and annuity businesses. the portion of these costs which are incremental and direct to the acquisition of a new or renewal insurance policy or annuity contract are deferred. significant costs capitalized include sales based compensation related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance policies and annuity contracts, medical inspection costs for successful sales, and a portion of employee compensation and benefit costs based upon the amount of time spent on successful sales. sales based compensation paid to advisors and employees and third-party distributors is capitalized. employee compensation and benefits costs which are capitalized relate primarily to sales efforts, underwriting and processing. all other costs which are not incremental direct costs of acquiring an insurance policy or annuity contract are expensed as incurred.
we monitor principal dac amortization assumptions, such as persistency, mortality, morbidity, interest margin, variable annuity benefit utilization and maintenance expense levels each quarter and, when assessed independently, each could impact our dac balance.
the analysis of the dac balance and the corresponding amortization is a dynamic process that considers all relevant factors and assumptions described previously. unless management identifies a significant deviation over the course of the quarterly monitoring, management reviews and updates these dac amortization assumptions annually in the third quarter of each year.
non-traditional long-duration products for our non-traditional long-duration products (including variable and fixed annuity contracts, universal life ("ul") and variable universal life ("vul") insurance products), our dac balance at any reporting date is based on projections that show management expects there to be estimated gross profits ("egps") after that date to amortize the remaining balance. these projections are inherently uncertain because they require management to make assumptions about financial markets, mortality levels and contractholder and policyholder behavior over periods extending well into the future. projection periods used for our annuity products are typically 30 to 50 years and for our ul insurance products 50 years or longer.
egps vary based on persistency rates (assumptions at which contractholders and policyholders are expected to surrender, make withdrawals from and make deposits to their contracts), mortality levels, client asset value growth rates (based on equity and bond market performance), variable annuity benefit utilization and interest margins (the spread between earned rates on invested assets and rates credited to contractholder and policyholder accounts). changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time. when assumptions are changed, the percentage of egps used to amortize dac might also change. a change in the required amortization percentage is applied retrospectively; an increase in amortization percentage will result in a decrease in the dac balance and an increase in dac amortization expense, while a decrease in amortization percentage will result in an increase in the dac balance and a decrease in dac amortization expense.
the client asset value growth rates are the rates at which variable annuity and vul insurance contract values invested in separate accounts are assumed to appreciate in the future. the rates used vary by equity and fixed income investments. management reviews and, where appropriate, adjusts its assumptions with respect to client asset value growth rates on a regular basis. the long-term client asset value growth rates are based on assumed gross annual returns of 9% for equity funds and 6.6% for fixed income funds. we typically use a five-year mean reversion process as a guideline in setting near-term equity fund growth rates based on a long-term view
45
of financial market performance as well as recent actual performance. the suggested near-term equity fund growth rate is reviewed quarterly to ensure consistency with management's assessment of anticipated equity market performance.
a decrease of 100 basis points in separate account fund growth rate assumptions is likely to result in an increase in dac amortization and an increase in benefits and claims expense for variable annuity and vul insurance contracts. the following table presents the estimated impact to current period pretax income:

(1) an increase in the above assumptions by 100 basis points would result in an increase to pretax income for approximately the same amount.
an assessment of sensitivity associated with changes in any single assumption would not necessarily be an indicator of future results.
traditional long-duration products for our traditional long-duration products (including traditional life, disability income ("di") and long term care ("ltc") insurance products), our dac balance at any reporting date is based on projections that show management expects there to be adequate premiums after the date to amortize the remaining balance. these projections are inherently uncertain because they require management to make assumptions over periods extending well into the future. these assumptions include interest rates, persistency rates and mortality and morbidity rates and are not modified (unlocked) unless recoverability testing deems to be inadequate. projection periods used for our traditional life insurance are up to 30 years. projection periods for our di products can be up to 45 years. projection periods for ltc are often 50 years or longer. during the third quarter of 2016, premium deficiency testing of ltc resulted in the impairment of all ltc dac. we may experience accelerated amortization of dac if policies terminate earlier than projected or a slower rate of amortization of dac if policies persist longer than projected.
for traditional life and di insurance products, the assumptions provide for adverse deviations in experience and are revised only if management concludes experience will be so adverse that dac are not recoverable. if management concludes that dac are not recoverable, dac are reduced to the amount that is recoverable based on best estimate assumptions.
see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our dac accounting policy.
policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and claims we establish reserves to cover the risks associated with non-traditional and traditional long-duration products and short-duration products. reserves for non-traditional long-duration products include the liabilities related to guaranteed benefit provisions added to variable annuity contracts, variable and fixed annuity contracts and ul and vul policies and the embedded derivatives related to variable annuity contracts, equity indexed annuities ("eia") and indexed universal life ("iul") insurance. reserves for traditional long-duration products are established to provide adequately for future benefits and expenses for term life, whole life, di and ltc insurance products. reserves for short-duration products are established to provide adequately for incurred losses primarily related to auto and home policies.
the establishment of reserves is an estimation process using a variety of methods, assumptions and data elements. if actual experience is better than or equal to the results of the estimation process, then reserves should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses. if actual experience is worse than the results of the estimation process, additional reserves may be required.
non-traditional long-duration products liabilities for fixed account values on variable and fixed deferred annuities and ul and vul policies are equal to accumulation values, which are the cumulative gross deposits and credited interest less withdrawals and various charges.
a portion of our ul and vul policies have product features that result in profits followed by losses from the insurance component of the contract. these profits followed by losses can be generated by the cost structure of the product or secondary guarantees in the contract. the secondary guarantee ensures that, subject to specified conditions, the policy will not terminate and will continue to provide a death benefit even if there is insufficient policy value to cover the monthly deductions and charges. the liability for these future losses is determined using actuarial models to estimate the death benefits in excess of account value and the expected assessments (e.g. cost of insurance charges, contractual administrative charges, similar fees and investment margin). significant assumptions made in projecting future benefits and assessments relate to customer asset value growth rates, mortality, persistency and
46
investment margins and are consistent with those used for dac valuation for the same contracts. see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the liability for contracts with secondary guarantees.
liabilities for both eia products and indexed accounts of iul products are equal to the accumulation of host contract values covering guaranteed benefits and the fair value of embedded equity options.
the majority of the variable annuity contracts offered by us contain guaranteed minimum death benefit ("gmdb") provisions. when market values of the customer's accounts decline, the death benefit payable on a contract with a gmdb may exceed the contract accumulation value. we also offer variable annuities with death benefit provisions that gross up the amount payable by a certain percentage of contract earnings which are referred to as gain gross-up ("ggu") benefits. in addition, we offer contracts with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ("gmwb") and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit ("gmab") provisions and, until may 2007, we offered contracts containing guaranteed minimum income benefit ("gmib") provisions.
the gmdb and ggu liability is determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits in excess of the projected contract accumulation value and recognizing the excess over the estimated life based on expected assessments (e.g., mortality and expense fees, contractual administrative charges and similar fees).
if elected by the contract owner and after a stipulated waiting period from contract issuance, a gmib guarantees a minimum lifetime annuity based on a specified rate of contract accumulation value growth and predetermined annuity purchase rates. the gmib liability is determined each period by estimating the expected value of annuitization benefits in excess of the projected contract accumulation value at the date of annuitization and recognizing the excess over the estimated life based on expected assessments.
the liability for the life contingent benefits associated with gmwb provisions is determined by estimating the expected value of benefits that are contingent upon survival after the account value is equal to zero and recognizing the benefits over the estimated life based on expected assessments (e.g., mortality and expense fees, contractual administrative charges and similar fees).
in determining the liabilities for gmdb, ggu, gmib and the life contingent benefits associated with gmwb, we project these benefits and contract assessments using actuarial models to simulate various equity market scenarios. significant assumptions made in projecting future benefits and assessments relate to customer asset value growth rates, mortality, persistency, benefit utilization and investment margins and are consistent with those used for dac valuation for the same contracts. as with dac, management reviews, and where appropriate, adjusts its assumptions each quarter. unless management identifies a material deviation over the course of quarterly monitoring, management reviews and updates these assumptions annually in the third quarter of each year.
see the above table in the discussion of "deferred acquisition costs" for the estimated impact to benefits and claims expense related to variable annuity and vul insurance contracts resulting from a decrease of 100 basis points in separate account fund growth rate assumptions.
the fair value of embedded derivatives related to gmab and the non-life contingent benefits associated with gmwb provisions fluctuates based on equity, interest rate and credit markets which can cause these embedded derivatives to be either an asset or a liability. in addition, embedded derivatives are impacted by an estimate of our current nonperformance risk adjustment. this estimate results in a spread over the libor swap curve as of the balance sheet date. as our estimate of this spread over libor widens or tightens, the liability will increase or decrease. see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the fair value measurement of embedded derivatives.
traditional long-duration products the liabilities for traditional long-duration products include liabilities for unpaid amounts on reported claims, estimates of benefits payable on claims incurred but not yet reported and estimates of benefits that will become payable on term life, whole life, di and ltc policies as claims are incurred in the future.
liabilities for unpaid amounts on reported life insurance claims are equal to the death benefits payable under the policies.
liabilities for unpaid amounts on reported di and ltc claims include any periodic or other benefit amounts due and accrued, along with estimates of the present value of obligations for continuing benefit payments. these unpaid amounts are calculated using anticipated claim continuance rates based on established industry tables, adjusted as appropriate for our experience. the discount rates used to calculate present values are based on average interest rates earned on assets supporting the liability for unpaid amounts.
liabilities for estimated benefits payable on claims that have been incurred but not yet reported are based on periodic analysis of the actual time lag between when a claim occurs and when it is reported.
liabilities for estimates of benefits that will become payable on future claims on term life, whole life, di and ltc policies are based on the net level premium method, using anticipated premium payments, mortality and morbidity rates, policy persistency and interest rates earned on assets supporting the liability. anticipated mortality and morbidity rates are based on established industry mortality and morbidity tables, with modifications based on our experience. anticipated premium payments and persistency rates vary by policy form, issue age, policy duration and certain other pricing factors.
for term life, whole life, di and ltc policies, we utilize best estimate assumptions as of the date the policy is issued with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation, as appropriate. after the liabilities are initially established, management performs premium deficiency tests using best estimate assumptions without provisions for adverse deviation annually in the third quarter of each year
47
unless management identifies a material deviation over the course of quarterly monitoring. if the liabilities determined based on these best estimate assumptions are greater than the net reserves (i.e., gaap reserves net of any dac balance), the existing net reserves are adjusted by first reducing the dac balance by the amount of the deficiency or to zero through a change to current period earnings. if the deficiency is more than the dac balance, then the net reserves are increased by the excess through a charge to current period earnings. if a premium deficiency is recognized, the assumptions as of the date of the loss recognition are locked in and used in subsequent periods. the assumptions for ltc insurance products are management's best estimate as of the date of loss recognition and thus no longer provide for adverse deviations in experience.
short-duration products the liabilities for short-duration products primarily include auto and home reserves comprised of amounts determined from loss reports on individual claims, as well as amounts based on historical loss experience for losses incurred but not yet reported. such liabilities are based on estimates. our methods for making such estimates and for establishing the resulting liabilities are continually reviewed, and any adjustments are reflected in earnings in the period such adjustments are made.
see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and claims accounting policy.
derivative instruments and hedging activities we use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to various market risks. all derivatives are recorded at fair value. the fair value of our derivative instruments is determined using either market quotes or valuation models that are based upon the net present value of estimated future cash flows and incorporate current market observable inputs to the extent available.
for further details on the types of derivatives we use and how we account for them, see note 2, note 14 and note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. for discussion of our market risk exposures and hedging program and related sensitivity testing, see item 7a. "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."
income tax accounting inherent in the provision for income taxes are estimates and judgments regarding the tax treatment of certain items. estimates and judgments are re-evaluated on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. in the event that the ultimate tax treatment of items differs from our estimates, we may be required to significantly change the provision for income taxes recorded in our consolidated financial statements.
we are required to establish a valuation allowance for any portion of our deferred tax assets that management believes will not be realized. significant judgment is required in determining if a valuation allowance should be established, and the amount of such allowance if required. factors used in making this determination include estimates relating to the performance of the business. consideration is given to, among other things in making this determination, (i) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, (iii) taxable income in prior carryback years, and (iv) tax planning strategies. management may need to identify and implement appropriate planning strategies to ensure our ability to realize our deferred tax assets and reduce the likelihood of the establishment of a valuation allowance with respect to such assets.
see note 2 and note 21 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our accounting policies for income taxes and our valuation allowance.
recent accounting pronouncements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition, see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.
sources of revenues and expenses management and financial advice fees management and financial advice fees relate primarily to fees earned from managing mutual funds, separate account and wrap account assets and institutional investments, as well as fees earned from providing financial advice, administrative services (including transfer agent and administration fees earned from providing services to retail mutual funds) and other custodial services. management and financial advice fees include performance-based incentive management fees, which we may receive on certain management contracts. management and financial advice fees also include mortality and expense risk fees.
distribution fees distribution fees primarily include point-of-sale fees (such as mutual fund front-end sales loads) and asset-based fees (such as 12b-1 distribution and shareholder service fees). distribution fees also include amounts received under marketing support arrangements for sales of mutual funds and other companies' products, such as through our wrap accounts, as well as surrender charges on annuities and ul and vul insurance.
48
net investment income net investment income primarily includes interest income on fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale, mortgage loans, policy and certificate loans, other investments, cash and cash equivalents and investments of cies; the changes in fair value of trading securities, certain derivatives and certain assets and liabilities of cies; the pro rata share of net income or loss on equity method investments; and realized gains and losses on the sale of securities and charges for other-than-temporary impairments of investments related to credit losses.
premiums premiums include premiums on auto and home insurance, traditional life, di and ltc insurance and immediate annuities with a life contingent feature and are net of reinsurance premiums.
other revenues other revenues primarily include variable annuity guaranteed benefit rider charges and ul and vul insurance charges, which consist of cost of insurance charges (net of reinsurance premiums and cost of reinsurance for ul insurance products) and administrative charges. prior to january 1, 2016, we also recorded revenue related to consolidated property funds managed by threadneedle. these revenues represented rental income of managed properties and changes in the fair value of real estate held in consolidated property funds. effective january 1, 2016, the property funds were deconsolidated due to the adoption of asu 2015-02.
for discussion of our accounting policies on revenue recognition, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
banking and deposit interest expense banking and deposit interest expense primarily includes interest expense related to investment certificates. the changes in fair value of stock market certificate embedded derivatives and the derivatives hedging stock market certificates are included within banking and deposit interest expense.
distribution expenses distribution expenses primarily include compensation paid to our financial advisors, registered representatives, third-party distributors and wholesalers, net of amounts capitalized and amortized as part of dac. the amounts capitalized and amortized are based on actual distribution costs. the majority of these costs, such as advisor and wholesaler compensation, vary directly with the level of sales. distribution expenses also include marketing support and other distribution and administration related payments made to affiliated and unaffiliated distributors of products provided by our affiliates. the majority of these expenses vary with the level of sales, or assets held, by these distributors, and the remainder is fixed. distribution expenses also include wholesaling costs.
interest credited to fixed accounts interest credited to fixed accounts represents amounts earned by contractholders and policyholders on fixed account values associated with ul and vul insurance and annuity contracts. the changes in fair value of eia and iul embedded derivatives and the derivatives hedging these products are included within interest credited to fixed accounts.
benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses consist of amounts paid and changes in liabilities held for anticipated future benefit payments under insurance policies and annuity contracts, along with costs to process and pay such amounts. amounts are net of benefit payments recovered or expected to be recovered under reinsurance contracts. benefits under variable annuity guarantees include the changes in fair value of gmwb and gmab embedded derivatives and the derivatives hedging these benefits, as well as the changes in fair value of derivatives hedging gmdb provisions. benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses also include amortization of dsic.
amortization of dac direct sales commissions and other costs capitalized as dac are amortized over time. for annuity and ul contracts, dac are amortized based on projections of estimated gross profits over amortization periods equal to the approximate life of the business. for other insurance products, dac are generally amortized as a percentage of premiums over amortization periods equal to the premium-paying period.
interest and debt expense interest and debt expense primarily includes interest on corporate debt and debt of cies, the impact of interest rate hedging activities and amortization of debt issuance costs.
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense includes compensation, share-based awards and other benefits for employees (other than employees directly related to distribution, including financial advisors), professional and consultant fees, information technology, facilities and equipment, advertising and promotion, legal and regulatory and corporate related expenses.
49
assets under management and administration assets under management ("aum") include external client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the columbia threadneedle funds, assets of institutional clients and assets of clients in our advisor platform held in wrap accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisers selected by us. aum also includes certain assets on our consolidated balance sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our asset management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and cies. these assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority. corporate & other aum primarily includes former bank assets that are managed within our corporate & other segment.
assets under administration ("aua") include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies' products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. these assets include those held in clients' brokerage accounts. we generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. we do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. these assets are not reported on our consolidated balance sheets. aua also includes certain assets on our consolidated balance sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. these assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.

overall pretax income decreased $550 million, or 26%, to $1.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $2.1 billion for the prior year primarily due to the impact of unlocking, asset management net outflows and a $127 million decrease in net income (loss) from cies, partially offset by the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related dac amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual), a $24 million favorable change in the market impact of hedges on investments, and the impact on dac, dsic and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance.
net income (loss) from cies for the year ended december 31, 2016 was a loss of $2 million compared to income of $125 million for the prior year primarily reflecting the deconsolidation of cies effective january 1, 2016. results for the year ended december 31, 2016 included $46 million of management fees we earned for services provided to deconsolidated cies. these fees were eliminated on a consolidated basis in the prior year.
the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related dac amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual) was a benefit of $36 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to an expense of $1 million for the prior year.
the impact on dac, dsic and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $18 million ($6 million for dac, $2 million for dsic and $10 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the year ended december 31, 2016 reflecting favorable bond fund returns compared to a net expense of $12 million ($15 million for dac, $4 million for dsic and a $7 million benefit for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the prior year reflecting unfavorable equity market and bond fund returns.

net revenues net revenues decreased $474 million, or 4%, to $11.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $12.2 billion for the prior year due to decreases in management and financial advice fees, distribution fees, net investment income and other revenues. net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 included $128 million of cie revenues compared to $446 million for the prior year primarily reflecting the cie deconsolidation.
management and financial advice fees decreased $172 million, or 3%, to $5.8 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $6.0 billion for the prior year primarily due to lower asset-based fees driven by a decrease in average aum and a $44 million decrease in performance fees. average aum decreased $28.3 billion, or 4%, compared to the prior year due to asset management net outflows and the negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by wrap account net inflows. see our discussion on the changes in aum in our segment results of operations section. management and financial advice fees for the year ended december 31, 2016 included $46 million of fees we earned for services provided to clos and property funds that were deconsolidated effective january 1, 2016. these fees were eliminated on a consolidated basis in the prior year.
distribution fees decreased $52 million, or 3%, to $1.8 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the prior year primarily due to lower transactional volume, partially offset by higher brokerage cash spread due to an increase in short-term interest rates.
net investment income decreased $112 million, or 7%, to $1.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $1.7 billion for the prior year primarily due to a $76 million decrease in cie net investment income, a $35 million decrease in investment income on fixed maturities driven by low interest rates and a $26 million increase in losses related to investments in affordable housing partnerships, partially offset by a $24 million favorable change in the market impact of hedges on investments. net investment income for the year ended december 31, 2016 included $155 million of cie net investment income compared to $231 million for the prior year primarily reflecting the cie deconsolidation.
other revenues decreased $165 million, or 13%, to $1.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $1.3 billion for the prior year due to a $290 million decrease in cie other revenues reflecting the cie deconsolidation, partially offset by the impact of unlocking, the unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits and higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates on variable annuity guarantees. the unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits was a positive $24 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to a positive $7 million for the prior year. other revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 included a $64 million favorable impact from unlocking compared to an $8 million favorable impact in the prior year. the primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 was a positive impact from higher projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from unfavorable mortality experience. the primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the prior year was a positive impact from model updates related to our indexed universal life product, partially offset by a negative impact from lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience.
expenses total expenses increased $76 million, or 1%, to $10.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $10.0 billion for the prior year primarily due to the impact of unlocking, partially offset by lower distribution expenses and the cie deconsolidation. expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016 included $130 million of cie expenses compared to $321 million for the prior year primarily reflecting the cie deconsolidation.
52
distribution expenses decreased $74 million, or 2%, to $3.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $3.3 billion for the prior year driven by lower advisor compensation due to lower transactional volume, as well as a $27 million benefit related to the release of the deferred reinsurance liability in connection with loss recognition testing of ltc insurance products in the third quarter of 2016.
interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $45 million, or 7%, to $623 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $668 million for the prior year primarily due to lower average fixed annuity account balances and the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges, partially offset by higher average variable annuities fixed sub-account balances. the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges was a benefit of $30 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to an expense of $4 million for the prior year. average fixed annuity account balances decreased $976 million, or 9%, to $10.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the prior year as older policies continue to lapse and new sales are limited due to low interest rates. average variable annuities fixed sub-account balances increased $179 million, or 4%, to $5.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the prior year.
benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $385 million, or 17%, to $2.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $2.3 billion for the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:
•   the year ended december 31, 2016 included a $229 million expense from unlocking compared to a $58 million benefit in the prior year. the unlocking impact for the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily reflected continued low interest rates and an unfavorable impact from persistency on living benefit reserves, partially offset by a benefit from updates to withdrawal utilization and fee assumptions, as well as market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation. the unlocking impact for the prior year primarily reflected an update to market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation and a benefit from model changes that more than offset the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the low interest rate environment.
•   a $39 million increase in ltc reserves in 2016, which included a $29 million out-of-period correction related to our claim utilization assumption, a $5 million out-of-period correction related to our waiver of premium claim reserve and a $5 million impact from assumption changes for our active life reserve valuation as a result of loss recognition.
•   a $28 million favorable impact in the prior year from updating future experience assumptions related to life rider benefits.
•   a $24 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.
•   a $40 million decrease in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses related to our auto and home business due to improved current year loss performance and a $20 million decrease in reserves in 2016 due to favorable prior year reserve development compared to a $57 million increase in reserves in 2015 due to unfavorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by an increase in catastrophe losses compared to the prior year and a $26 million increase in additional losses. catastrophe losses were $104 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $72 million for the prior year.
amortization of dac increased $61 million, or 17%, to $415 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $354 million for the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:
•   the impact of unlocking was an expense of $81 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to an expense of $15 million for the prior year. the unlocking impact for the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily reflected continued low interest rates that more than offset benefits from persistency on annuity contracts without living benefits. in connection with the loss recognition on ltc insurance products in the third quarter of 2016, we impaired $58 million of dac due to continued low interest rates, higher morbidity and higher reinsurance expenses, slightly offset by premium increases.
•   the dac offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual) was an expense of $18 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to an expense of $4 million for the prior year.
•   the impact on dac from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $6 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to an expense of $15 million for the prior year reflecting favorable bond fund returns in 2016 compared to unfavorable equity market and bond fund returns in the prior year.
interest and debt expense decreased $146 million, or 38%, to $241 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $387 million for the prior year primarily due to a $135 million decrease in cie interest and debt expense reflecting the cie deconsolidation.
general and administrative expenses decreased $105 million, or 3%, to $3.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $3.1 billion for the prior year primarily due to a $56 million decrease in cie expenses reflecting the cie deconsolidation, a $10 million decrease in compensation related to lower performance fees, a benefit from the impact of foreign exchange, lower performance-based compensation, lower investment spending and a decrease in expenses related to technology, service delivery and advertising, partially offset by $30 million of incremental expense related to the planning and implementation

of the new department of labor fiduciary standard, an increase in staff and investments in our auto and home business and $23 million of expense in the second quarter of 2016 from the resolution of a legacy legal matter related to the hedge fund business.
income taxes our effective tax rate was 17.4% for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 21.3% for the prior year. the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2016 was lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction, low income housing tax credits, lower taxes on net income from foreign subsidiaries and a $27 million benefit related to final resolution on the 1997 through 2005 internal revenue service ("irs") audit. the decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the prior year was primarily due to lower pretax income in relation to tax preferred items.

the performance of each fund is measured on a consistent basis against the most appropriate benchmark - a peer group of similar funds or an index.
equal weighted: counts the number of funds with above median ranking (if measured against peer group) or above index performance (if measured against an index) divided by the total number of funds. asset size is not a factor.
asset weighted: sums the assets of the funds with above median ranking (if measured against peer group) or above index performance (if measured against an index) divided by the total sum of assets in the funds. funds with more assets will receive a greater share of the total percentage above or below median or index.
aggregated allocation (managed) funds include funds that invest in other funds of the threadneedle range including those funds that invest in both equity and fixed income.
aggregated threadneedle data includes funds on the threadneedle platform sub-advised by columbia management as well as advisors not affiliated with ameriprise financial, inc.
beginning in the first quarter of 2016, the columbia management and threadneedle aum rollforwards have been combined to align with the columbia threadneedle investments brand, which represents the combined capabilities, resources and reach of both firms. in addition, we combined the rollforwards for institutional and alternative aum and included the change in affiliated general account assets in the market appreciation (depreciation) and other line within the combined aum rollforward. all changes were made on a retrospective basis.

(1) inflows associated with acquisitions that closed during the period.
(2) included in market appreciation and other for retail funds in 2015 are $(0.5) billion related to the sale of the multi-manager business.
(3) amounts represent local currency to us dollar translation for reporting purposes.
(4) prior to the third quarter of 2016, the foreign currency translation line represented british pound to us dollar conversion, while the impact of translating assets from a local currency to british pounds was included in market appreciation (depreciation) and other. beginning with the third quarter of 2016, the impact of translating assets from a local currency to british pounds has been reclassified to the foreign currency translation line. all prior periods have been restated.
(5) included in market appreciation and other for global institutional in 2016 and 2015 are $(0.4) billion and $(0.1) billion, respectively, due to the transfer of assets from separately managed accounts to unified managed accounts.
(6) includes $1.7 billion and $(1.6) billion for the total change in affiliated general account assets during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
(7) former parent company related assets and net new flows are included in the rollforwards above.
in a referendum in june 2016, the united kingdom (uk) voted to leave the european union (eu), which caused volatility in capital and currency markets. the full impact of the british exit from the eu (commonly known as "brexit") remains uncertain. this uncertainty, which is expected to last for a lengthy period of time, has had and may continue to have a negative impact on our uk and european net flows and foreign currency translation resulting from the weakening of the british pound.
total segment aum decreased $17.5 billion, or 4%, during the year ended december 31, 2016 driven by net outflows, a negative impact of foreign currency translation and retail fund distributions, partially offset by market appreciation and other. total segment aum net outflows were $18.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016, which included $9.9 billion of outflows of former parent-related assets. management expects, consistent with prior patterns of outflows, that outflows of primarily low margin assets directly or indirectly affiliated with former parent companies will continue for the foreseeable future. the overall impact to segment results is difficult to quantify due to uncertain timing, volume and mix of the outflows.

global retail funds decreased $4.0 billion, or 2%, during the year ended december 31, 2016 due to net outflows, distributions and a negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by market appreciation and other. global retail net outflows of $4.2 billion during the year ended december 31, 2016 included $2.5 billion of outflows from the columbia acorn® fund, $1.3 billion of outflows from former parent-related assets, $2.0 billion of outflows of our variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts and uk and european net outflows of $1.7 billion, partially offset by reinvested dividends of $8.1 billion and inflows of $1.0 billion related to the ega acquisition.
global institutional aum decreased $13.5 billion, or 6%, during the year ended december 31, 2016 due to net outflows of $14.4 billion and a $12.6 billion negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by market appreciation and other. global institutional net outflows included $0.7 billion from the termination of a former subadvisor and $8.6 billion of outflows of former parent-related assets.

our asset management segment pretax operating earnings, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $140 million, or 18%, to $621 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $761 million for the prior year primarily due to net outflows, a $34 million decrease in performance fees, net of related compensation, a $12 million negative impact of foreign exchange and a $9 million expense from the resolution of a legacy legal matter related to the hedge fund business, partially offset by continued expense management.
net revenues net revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $290 million, or 9%, to $3.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $3.3 billion for the prior year primarily due to lower management and financial advice fees.
management and financial advice fees decreased $271 million, or 10%, to $2.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $2.7 billion for the prior year as average aum decreased $35.7 billion, or 7%, compared to the prior year. the decrease in fees is driven by cumulative net outflows from our higher fee yielding retail funds, a negative foreign currency translation impact related to our uk and european aum and a $44 million decrease in performance fees. our average weighted equity index, which is a proxy for equity movements on aum, decreased 1% for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the prior year.
expenses total expenses decreased $150 million, or 6%, to $2.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $2.5 billion for the prior year due to a $72 million decrease in distribution expenses from lower retail fund assets and a decrease in general and administrative expense.
general and administrative expense decreased $75 million, or 6%, to $1.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $1.4 billion for the prior year primarily due to a $10 million decrease in compensation related to lower performance fees, a benefit from the impact of foreign exchange, lower performance-based compensation and lower investment spending, partially offset by a $9 million expense from the resolution of a legacy legal matter related to the hedge fund business.

our annuities segment pretax operating income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses (net of the related dsic and dac amortization) and the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related dsic and dac amortization), decreased $321 million, or 49%, to $329 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $650 million for the prior year primarily due to the impact of unlocking, lower investment yields and the negative impact from fixed annuity net outflows, partially offset by the impact on dac, dsic and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance, as well as higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales, net of related expenses for reserve funding.
the impact on dac, dsic and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $18 million ($6 million for dac, $2 million for dsic and $10 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the year ended december 31, 2016 reflecting favorable bond fund returns compared to a net expense of $11 million ($14 million for dac, $4 million for dsic and a $7 million benefit for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the prior year reflecting unfavorable equity market and bond fund returns.
we expect an ongoing impact of $40 million per year to variable annuity earnings relating to assumption changes made during the third quarter unlocking process. this impact is primarily from an increase in the growth rate of the living benefit reserve. results in the fourth quarter of 2016 included an $11 million negative impact from this change.
riversource variable annuity account balances increased 1% to $74.8 billion at december 31, 2016 compared to the prior year due to equity market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $2.2 billion.
riversource fixed annuity account balances declined 6% to $10.0 billion at december 31, 2016 compared to the prior year as older policies continue to lapse and new sales are limited due to low interest rates. given the current interest rate environment, our current fixed annuity book is expected to gradually run off and earnings on our fixed annuity business will trend down.
net revenues net revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $78 million, or 3%, to $2.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the prior year primarily due to lower management and financial advice fees, distribution fees and net investment income, partially offset by higher other revenues.
management and financial advice fees decreased $23 million, or 3%, to $732 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $755 million for the prior year due to lower fees on variable annuities driven by lower average separate account balances. average variable annuity account balances decreased $2.6 billion, or 4%, from the prior year primarily due to net outflows.
61
net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $88 million, or 10%, to $760 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $848 million for the prior year reflecting a decrease of approximately $49 million from lower invested assets primarily due to fixed annuity net outflows and approximately $39 million from lower interest rates.
other revenues increased $39 million, or 8%, to $506 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $467 million for the prior year due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates on variable annuity guarantees.
expenses total expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related dsic and dac amortization) and the dac and dsic offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $243 million, or 13%, to $2.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $1.9 billion for the prior year primarily due to the impact of unlocking.
distribution expenses decreased $23 million, or 5%, to $423 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $446 million for the prior year due to lower variable annuity compensation driven by lower sales and lower average separate account balances.
interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $22 million, or 4%, to $478 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $500 million for the prior year driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances, partially offset by higher average variable annuities fixed sub-account balances. average fixed annuity account balances decreased $976 million, or 9%, to $10.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the prior year as older policies continue to lapse and new sales are limited due to low interest rates. average variable annuities fixed sub-account balances increased $179 million, or 4%, to $5.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the prior year.
benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related dsic amortization) and the dsic offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $298 million, or 62%, to $780 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $482 million for the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:
•   benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016 included a $197 million expense from unlocking primarily reflecting continued low interest rates and an unfavorable impact from persistency on living benefit reserves, partially offset by a benefit from updates to withdrawal utilization and fee assumptions, as well as market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation. benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses for the prior year included a $61 million benefit from unlocking primarily reflecting an update to market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation and a benefit from model changes that more than offset the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the low interest rate environment.
•   a $24 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.
•   a $9 million negative impact in the fourth quarter of 2016 from changes in assumptions in the third quarter unlocking process that result in ongoing increases to living benefit reserves.
amortization of dac, which excludes the dac offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits and the dac offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $4 million, or 2%, to $209 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $205 million for the prior year primarily due to the impact of unlocking, partially offset by the impact on dac from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance, which was a benefit of $6 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to an expense of $14 million for the prior year reflecting favorable bond fund returns in 2016 compared to unfavorable equity market and bond fund returns in the prior year. amortization of dac for the year ended december 31, 2016 included an $18 million expense from unlocking reflecting continued low interest rates, partially offset by benefits from persistency on annuity contracts without living benefits. our long-term interest rate assumption remains unchanged, but we extended the period it would take for rates to reach our long term level from 3.5 years to 5.5 years. amortization of dac for the prior year included a $5 million benefit from unlocking primarily driven by improved persistency that more than offset the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the low interest rate environment.

december 31, 2016 compared to $2.2 billion for the prior year due to increases in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, amortization of dac and general and administrative expense, partially offset by a decrease in distribution expenses.
distribution expenses decreased $31 million, or 53%, to $28 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $59 million for the prior year primarily due to a $27 million benefit related to the release of the deferred reinsurance liability in connection with loss recognition testing of ltc insurance products in the third quarter of 2016.
benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $81 million, or 5%, to $1.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:
•   benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016 included a $46 million expense from unlocking primarily reflecting continued low interest rates and unfavorable mortality experience. benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses for the prior year included a $6 million expense from unlocking.
•   a $39 million increase in ltc reserves in 2016, which included a $29 million out-of-period correction related to our claim utilization assumption, a $5 million out-of-period correction related to our waiver of premium claim reserve and a $5 million impact from assumption changes for our active life reserve valuation as a result of loss recognition.
•   a $28 million favorable impact in the prior year from updating future experience assumptions related to life rider benefits.
•   a $7 million increase in life and health insurance claims.
•   a $40 million decrease in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses related to our auto and home business due to improved current year loss performance and a $20 million decrease in reserves in 2016 due to favorable prior year reserve development compared to a $57 million increase in reserves in 2015 due to unfavorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by an increase in catastrophe losses compared to the prior year and a $26 million increase in additional losses. catastrophe losses were $104 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $72 million for the prior year.
amortization of dac increased $46 million, or 30%, to $201 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $155 million for the prior year primarily due to the impact of unlocking. the impact of unlocking was an expense of $65 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to an expense of $10 million for the prior year. the unlocking impact for the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily reflected the dac write-off of $58 million in connection with the loss recognition on ltc insurance products due to continued low interest rates, higher morbidity and higher reinsurance expenses, slightly offset by premium increases. the unlocking impact for the prior year was primarily driven by the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the low interest rate environment.
general and administrative expense increased $20 million, or 8%, to $273 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $253 million for the prior year primarily due to an increase in staff and investments in our auto and home business.

overall income from continuing operations before income tax provision decreased $405 million, or 16%, to $2.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $2.5 billion for the prior year primarily reflecting a $256 million decrease in net income from cies, a negative market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related dsic and dac amortization), a $42 million benefit in the prior year from policyholder movement of investments in portfolio navigator (traditional asset allocation) funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the portfolio stabilizer (managed volatility) funds

compared to a $6 million benefit for the year ended december 31, 2015, an increase in provision for estimated losses for our auto and home business, higher life and ltc insurance claims, fixed annuity net outflows, a negative impact of foreign exchange, asset management net outflows, a decrease in net realized investment gains, the unfavorable market impact of hedges on investments and the impact on dac and dsic from actual versus expected market performance, partially offset by the favorable impact of unlocking, higher asset management performance fees, wrap account net inflows, market appreciation, and lower performance-based compensation expense.
the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related dsic and dac amortization) was an expense of $214 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to an expense of $94 million for the prior year. the impact on dac and dsic from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was an expense of $19 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 reflecting unfavorable equity market returns compared to a benefit of $26 million for the prior year reflecting favorable equity market and bond fund returns.

net revenues decreased $98 million, or 1%, to $12.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $12.3 billion for the prior year primarily due to a decrease in other revenues, partially offset by an increase in management and financial advice fees.
management and financial advice fees increased $140 million, or 2%, to $6.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $5.8 billion for the prior year primarily due to higher asset-based fees driven by an increase in average aum and a $39 million increase in performance fees. average aum increased $2.1 billion to $653.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $651.4 billion for the prior year primarily due to market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. see our discussion on the changes in aum in our segment results of operations section below.
distribution fees decreased $47 million, or 2%, to $1.8 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $1.9 billion for the prior year primarily due to lower client activity.
net investment income decreased $53 million, or 3%, to $1.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $1.7 billion for the prior year due to a $76 million decrease in investment income on fixed maturities primarily due to low interest rates, a $21 million loss related to the market impact of hedges on investments and a $33 million decrease in net realized investment gains, partially offset by a $74 million increase in net investment income of cies.
premiums increased $70 million, or 5%, to $1.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $1.4 billion for the prior year primarily due to a 3% increase in auto and home policies in force.
other revenues decreased $206 million, or 14%, to $1.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year due to a $278 million decrease in other revenues of cies primarily due to lower gains from changes in the fair value of real estate held in the consolidated property funds, partially offset by the impact of unlocking and higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates. other revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015 included an $8 million favorable impact from unlocking compared to a $29 million negative impact in the prior year. the primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015 was a positive impact from model updates related to our indexed universal life product, partially offset by a negative impact from lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience. the primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the prior year was lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience.
expenses total expenses increased $307 million, or 3%, to $10.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $9.7 billion for the prior year primarily due to an increase in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses.
66
distribution expenses increased $40 million, or 1%, to $3.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $3.2 billion for the prior year driven by higher advisor compensation due to growth in average assets under management.
interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $45 million, or 6%, to $668 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $713 million for the prior year driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances. average fixed annuity account balances decreased $1.3 billion, or 11%, to $11.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the prior year due to net outflows reflecting higher lapse rates and limited new sales due to low interest rates.
benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $279 million, or 14%, to $2.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $2.0 billion for the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:
•   the year ended december 31, 2015 included a $58 million benefit from unlocking compared to a $6 million expense in the prior year. the unlocking impact for the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily reflected an update to market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation and a benefit from model changes that more than offset the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the low interest rate environment. the unlocking impact for the prior year reflected lower than previously assumed interest rates, partially offset by a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption.
•   a $106 million increase related to our auto and home business due to an increase in the provision for estimated losses reflecting the impact of growth in exposures due to a 3% increase in policies in force, higher 2015 accident year loss ratio assumptions and prior year development. in 2015, we increased our claims reserves $57 million primarily related to the 2014 and prior accident years auto liability coverages. this increase was driven by elevated frequency and severity experience for auto injury claims, as well as a lower than expected level of impact in improving the outcome of 2014 and prior accident year existing claims. auto and home losses for the prior year included a $30 million increase to prior accident year loss reserves resulting from adverse development in the 2013 and prior accident years auto liability coverage and a $60 million increase to loss reserves for estimated losses including incurred but not reported ("ibnr") claims resulting from further adverse loss development observed primarily in the 2014 auto book of business. catastrophe losses were $72 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $66 million for the prior year.
•   a $17 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.
•   an increase in expenses compared to the prior year due to a $50 million benefit for the year ended december 31, 2014 from policyholder movement of investments in portfolio navigator funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the portfolio stabilizer funds compared to a $7 million benefit for the year ended december 31, 2015.
•   a $20 million increase in life insurance claims compared to the prior year primarily due to larger claims.
•   a $19 million increase in ltc claims compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in the number of open claims and an update in claim reserve assumptions partially offset by a higher interest rate used for ltc claims and the release of additional ltc reserves.
•   a $28 million favorable impact in 2015 from updating future experience assumptions relating to life rider benefits.
•   a $78 million increase in expense compared to the prior year from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. as the embedded derivative liability on which the nonperformance credit spread is applied increases (decreases), the impact of the nonperformance credit spread is favorable (unfavorable) to expense. the favorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $68 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to a favorable impact of $146 million for the prior year.
•   a $60 million increase in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related dsic amortization. this increase was the result of a favorable $785 million change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves, an unfavorable $843 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits and an unfavorable $2 million dsic offset. the main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:
•   interest rate impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in lower expense in 2015 compared to 2014.
•   equity market and volatility impacts on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in an expense in 2015 compared to a benefit in 2014.
•   other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a net unfavorable impact compared to the prior year.
interest and debt expense increased $59 million, or 18%, to $387 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $328 million for the prior year due to new clos launched in 2015.
67
income taxes our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations including income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 21.3% for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 21.4% for the prior year. our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations excluding income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 22.6% for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 25.2% for the prior year. the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2015 was lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction and low income housing tax credits.

(1) beginning april 1, 2014, net flows reflect all additions and withdrawals to and from the sps wrap account program. prior to april 1, 2014, additions and withdrawals to and from certain non-billable investments of this program were reflected in the market appreciation and other line and purchases and sales of billable investments were reported in the net flows line. nets flows for the sps program are now reported on a consistent basis with our other wrap account programs.
(2) advisory wrap account assets represent those assets for which clients receive advisory services and are the primary driver of revenue earned on wrap accounts. clients may hold non-advisory investments in their wrap accounts that do not incur an advisory fee.
(3) average ending balances are calculated using an average of the prior period's ending balance and all months in the current period.
wrap account assets increased $5.8 billion, or 3%, during the year ended december 31, 2015 due to net inflows of $11.1 billion, partially offset by market depreciation and other of $5.3 billion. average advisory wrap account assets increased $14.6 billion, or 9%, compared to the prior year primarily due to net inflows and market appreciation.

our asset management segment pretax operating earnings, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $27 million, or 3%, to $761 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $788 million for the prior year due to net outflows and a $23 million negative impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by equity market appreciation, continued expense management and a $22 million positive impact from higher performance fees, net of related compensation.
net revenues net revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $66 million, or 2%, to $3.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $3.3 billion for the prior year driven by a decrease in management and financial advice fees.
management and financial advice fees decreased $68 million, or 2%, to $2.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $2.8 billion for the prior year primarily due to lower asset-based fees driven by a decrease in average aum and a $53 million negative impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by a $37 million increase in performance fees. average aum decreased $10.8 billion, or 2%, compared to the prior year primarily due to net outflows and the negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by market appreciation.

our annuities segment pretax operating income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses (net of the related dsic and dac amortization) and the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related dsic and dac amortization), increased $17 million, or 3%, to $650 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $633 million for the prior year primarily due to the impact of unlocking, partially offset by the impact on dac and dsic from actual versus expected market performance, the negative impact from fixed annuity net outflows and a $44 million benefit in the prior year from policyholder movement of investments in portfolio navigator funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the portfolio stabilizer funds compared to a $6 million benefit in the current year.
the impact of unlocking was an increase to pretax operating income of $66 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to a decrease of $22 million for the prior year. the impact on dac and dsic from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was an expense of $18 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 reflecting unfavorable equity market returns compared to a benefit of $24 million for the prior year reflecting favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns.

•   the year ended december 31, 2015 included a $61 million benefit from unlocking primarily reflecting an update to market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation and a benefit from model changes that more than offset the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment. the prior year included a $5 million expense from unlocking primarily reflecting lower than previously assumed interest rates, partially offset by a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption.
•   an increase in expenses compared to the prior year due to a $52 million benefit for the year ended december 31, 2014 from policyholder movement of investments in portfolio navigator funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the portfolio stabilizer funds compared to a $7 million benefit for the year ended december 31, 2015.
•   a $17 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.
•   a $9 million increase in expense compared to the prior year due to the impact on dsic from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance. this impact was an expense of $4 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 reflecting unfavorable equity market returns compared to a benefit of $5 million for the prior year reflecting favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns.
amortization of dac, which excludes the dac offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits and the dac offset to net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $30 million, or 13%, to $205 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $235 million for the prior year primarily due to the impact of unlocking, partially offset by the impact on dac from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance. amortization of dac for the year ended december 31, 2015 included a $5 million benefit from unlocking driven by improved persistency that more than offset the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment. amortization of dac for the prior year included a $17 million expense from unlocking primarily driven by lower than previously assumed interest rates, partially offset by favorable persistency and mortality experience and a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption.

during 2015, we conducted a review of our ltc reserve for unpaid amounts on reported claims based on additional information we received from genworth financial, inc., which reinsures 50% of our ltc business and administers all of our claims. based on this information, along with a review of the discount rate, management's best estimate for ltc claims reserves resulted in a net $14 million increase. the most significant drivers of the reserve increase were updates to the benefit utilization rates and claims termination rates, partially offset by a $15 million benefit from a higher discount rate. we also increased the discount rate for our disability income ("di") reserve for unpaid amounts on reported claims, which resulted in a $7 million reserve decrease. in addition, results for 2015 included an $11 million unfavorable impact related to a reinsurance premium correction, a $13 million favorable impact related to a ltc future loss reserve adjustment and a $28 million favorable impact from updating future experience assumptions relating to life rider benefits.

revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015 included a $5 million negative impact from unlocking compared to a $29 million negative impact in the prior year. the primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues in both periods was lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience.
expenses total expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related dac amortization) and the dac offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $160 million, or 8%, to $2.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $2.0 billion for the prior year primarily due to increases in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses and amortization of dac.
benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $122 million, or 9%, to $1.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $1.4 billion for the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:
•   a $106 million increase related to our auto and home business due to an increase in the provision for estimated losses reflecting the impact of growth in exposures due to a 3% increase in policies in force, higher 2015 accident year loss ratio assumptions and prior year development. in 2015, we increased our claims reserves $57 million primarily related to the 2014 and prior accident years auto liability coverages. this increase was driven by elevated frequency and severity experience for auto injury claims, as well as a lower than expected level of impact in improving the outcome of 2014 and prior accident year existing claims. auto and home losses for the prior year included a $30 million increase to prior accident year loss reserves resulting from adverse development in the 2013 and prior accident years auto liability coverage and a $60 million increase to loss reserves for estimated losses including ibnr claims resulting from further adverse loss development observed primarily in the 2014 auto book of business. catastrophe losses were $72 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $66 million for the prior year.
•   a $20 million increase in life insurance claims compared to the prior year primarily due to larger claims.
•   a $19 million increase in ltc claims compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in the number of open claims and an update in claim reserve assumptions partially offset by a higher interest rate used for ltc claims and the release of additional ltc reserves.
amortization of dac, which excludes the dac offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits and the dac offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $20 million, or 15%, to $155 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $135 million for the prior year primarily due to the impact of unlocking. amortization of dac for the year ended december 31, 2015 included a $10 million expense from unlocking primarily driven by the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment. amortization of dac for the prior year included a $9 million benefit from unlocking.

fair value measurements we report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, embedded derivatives, properties held by our consolidated property funds, and most investments and cash equivalents. fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. we include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. we validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our fair value measurements.
fair value of liabilities and nonperformance risk companies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). since there is not a market for our obligations of our variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. as a result, we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for profit, risk and expenses, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. the nonperformance risk adjustment is based on observable market data adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the libor swap curve as of december 31, 2016. as our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. if this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the libor swap curve, the reduction to net income would be approximately $287 million, net of dac, dsic, unearned revenue amortization, the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 35%), based on december 31, 2016 credit spreads.
liquidity and capital resources overview we maintained substantial liquidity during the year ended december 31, 2016. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents excluding cies. we have additional liquidity available through an unsecured revolving credit facility for up to $500 million that expires in may 2020. under the terms of the credit agreement, we can increase this facility to $750 million upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. at december 31, 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $1 million of outstanding letters of credit. our credit facility contains various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. we were in compliance with all such covenants at december 31, 2016.
in the first quarter of 2016, we extinguished $16 million of our junior subordinated notes due 2066 in open market transactions and recognized a gain of less than $1 million. in the second quarter of 2016, we redeemed our remaining outstanding junior subordinated notes due 2066 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal balance of the notes plus accrued and compounded interest.
on august 11, 2016, we issued $500 million of unsecured senior notes due september 15, 2026, and incurred debt issuance costs of $4 million. interest payments are due semi-annually in arrears on march 15 and september 15, commencing on march 15, 2017. the proceeds of the senior notes will be used for general corporate purposes.
we enter into short-term borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements and federal home loan bank ("fhlb") advances, to reduce reinvestment risk. short-term borrowings allow us to receive cash to reinvest in longer-duration assets, while paying back the short-term debt with cash flows generated by the fixed income portfolio. the balance of repurchase agreements at both december 31, 2016 and 2015 was $50 million, which is collateralized with agency residential mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities from our investment portfolio. our subsidiary, riversource life insurance company ("riversource life"), is a member of the fhlb of des moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. as of both december 31, 2016 and 2015, we had borrowings of $150 million from the fhlb, which is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities. we believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and our availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs.

dividends from subsidiaries ameriprise financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly owned subsidiaries. because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, riversource life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, ameriprise certificate company ("acc"), ampf holding corporation, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, ameriprise financial services, inc. ("afsi") and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, american enterprise investment services, inc. ("aeis"), our auto and home insurance subsidiary, ids property casualty insurance company ("ids property casualty"), doing business as ameriprise auto & home insurance, our transfer agent subsidiary, columbia management investment services corp., our investment advisory company, columbia management investment advisers, llc, and threadneedle asset management holdings sàrl. the payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements.

dividends paid to shareholders and share repurchases we paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling $489 million and $474 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. on february 1, 2017, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.75 per common share. the dividend will be paid on february 28, 2017 to our shareholders of record at the close of business on february 13, 2017.
in april 2014, our board of directors authorized an expenditure of up to $2.5 billion for the repurchase of shares of our common stock through april 28, 2016, which was exhausted in the three months ended march 31, 2016. in december 2015, our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $2.5 billion of our common stock through december 31, 2017. as of december 31, 2016, we had $929 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. we intend to fund share repurchases through existing working capital, future earnings and other customary financing methods. the share repurchase programs do not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. acquisitions under the share repurchase programs may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we repurchased a total of 17.5 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $95.53 per share.
cash flows cash flows of cies are reflected in our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. cash held by cies is not available for general use by ameriprise financial, nor is ameriprise financial cash available for general use by its cies. as such, the operating, investing and financing cash flows of the cies have no impact to the change in cash and cash equivalents.
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased $601 million to $2.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $2.6 billion for the prior year primarily due to higher cash outflows related to derivatives, as well as a decrease in cash from lower fee revenue net of related expenses.
net cash provided by operating activities increased $173 million to $2.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $2.4 billion for the prior year primarily due to a $118 million increase in cash from changes in other investments primarily related to trading securities and a $139 million reduction of income taxes paid, net, partially offset by a $67 million increase in interest paid on cie debt.
investing activities our investing activities primarily relate to our available-for-sale investment portfolio. further, this activity is significantly affected by the net flows of our investment certificate, fixed annuity and universal life products reflected in financing activities.
net cash used in investing activities increased $290 million to $804 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $514 million for the prior year primarily due to a $1.9 billion increase in cash used for purchases of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by a $1.2 billion increase in net cash related to changes in investments of cies primarily reflecting the cie deconsolidation, a $179 million increase in proceeds from sales, maturities and repayments of mortgage loans reflecting the sale of a portion of our consumer loans in the first quarter of 2016 and a $107 million decrease in funding of mortgage loans.
net cash used in investing activities decreased $201 million to $514 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $715 million for the prior year primarily reflecting a $520 million decrease in purchases of investments by cies and a $131 million increase in cash flows related to other investments, partially offset by a $435 million increase in purchases of available-for sale securities.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities decreased $1.2 billion to $1.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $2.3 billion for the prior year. net cash inflows related to investment certificates increased $465 million compared to the prior year due to higher proceeds from additions, partially offset by higher maturities, withdrawals and cash surrenders. cash outflows from surrenders and other benefits of policyholder account balances decreased $782 million compared to the prior year. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we repaid the remaining $245 million of our junior subordinated notes due 2066. in the third quarter of 2016, we issued $500 million of unsecured senior notes due 2026. net cash outflows related to noncontrolling interests decreased $160 million compared to the prior year reflecting the cie deconsolidation. net cash outflows related to borrowings of cies was $517 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to net cash inflows of $931 billion for the prior year primarily reflecting the cie deconsolidation.
net cash used in financing activities increased $661 million to $2.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $1.7 billion for the prior year. net cash inflows related to investment certificates increased $407 million compared to the prior year due to higher proceeds from additions, partially offset by higher maturities, withdrawals and cash surrenders. cash outflows from surrenders and other benefits of policyholder account balances increased $274 million compared to the prior year primarily reflecting higher lapse rates. cash outflows related to the repayment of long-term debt increased $209 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the maturity of our senior notes in 2015. cash flows for the prior year reflected a $543 million increase in cash from issuance of our unsecured senior notes due october 2024 and a $300 million decrease in cash related to short-term borrowings as we

reduced our borrowings from the fhlb. cash outflows related to the repurchase of common shares increased $164 million compared to the prior year. net cash inflows related to changes in debt of cies decreased $217 million compared to the prior year due to a decrease in borrowings of cies, partially offset by lower repayments of debt of cies.
contractual commitments the contractual obligations identified in the table below include both our on and off-balance sheet transactions that represent material expected or contractually committed future obligations. the table excludes obligations of cies as they are not direct obligations of the company and have recourse only to the assets of the cies. estimated cash payments due by period as of december 31, 2016 were as follows:

(1) see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for more information about our long-term debt. amounts include obligations under capital leases.
(2) these scheduled payments are represented by reserves of approximately $30.2 billion at december 31, 2016 and are based on interest credited, mortality, morbidity, lapse, surrender and premium payment assumptions. the estimated payments are presented gross before reinsurance. the scheduled payments are undiscounted and exceed the corresponding liability at december 31, 2016. actual payment obligations may differ if experience varies from these assumptions. for estimated payments as of december 31, 2016, we increased the projected period for which cash payments will be made from 35 to 40 years. this change increased our contractual commitments for the 2022 and thereafter period compared to our disclosure at december 31, 2015. separate account liabilities have been excluded as associated contractual obligations would be met by separate account assets.
(3) the payments due by year are based on contractual term maturities. however, contractholders have the right to redeem the investment certificates earlier and at their discretion subject to surrender charges, if any. redemptions are most likely to occur in periods of substantial increases in interest rates.
(4) the fair value of these commitments included on the consolidated balance sheets was $1.7 billion as of december 31, 2016. see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for more information about our deferred premium options.
(5) call dates for the obligations presented are either date or event specific. for date specific obligations, we are required to fund a specific amount on a stated date provided there are no defaults under the agreement. for event specific obligations, we are required to fund a specific amount of its capital commitment when properties in a fund become fully stabilized. for event specific obligations, the estimated call date of these commitments is used in the table above.
(6) purchase obligations include the minimum contractual amounts by period under contracts that were in effect at december 31, 2016. many of the purchase agreements giving rise to these purchase obligations include termination clauses that may require payment of termination fees if the agreements are terminated by us without cause prior to their stated expiration; however, the table reflects the amounts to be paid assuming the contracts are not terminated.
(7) interest on long-term debt was estimated based on rates in effect as of december 31, 2016.
in addition to the contractual commitments outlined in the table above, we periodically fund the employees' defined benefit plans. in 2017, we expect to contribute $31 million to our pension plans and $1 million to our defined benefit postretirement plans. see note 22 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
total loan funding commitments, which are not included in the table above due to uncertainty with respect to timing of future cash flows, were $265 million at december 31, 2016. for additional information relating to these contractual commitments, see note 23 to our consolidated financial statements.
off-balance sheet arrangements we provide asset management services to investment entities which are considered to be vies, such as clos, hedge funds, property funds and private equity funds, which are sponsored by us. we consolidate certain clos. we have determined that consolidation is not required for hedge funds, property funds and private equity funds, which are sponsored by us. our maximum exposure to loss with respect to our investment in these non-consolidated entities is limited to our carrying value. we have no obligation to provide further financial or other support to these investment entities nor have we provided any support to these investment entities. see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our arrangements with these investment entities.

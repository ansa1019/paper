developing and commercializing new medicines entails significant risk and expense. before significant revenues from the commercialization of our antibody candidates or new indications for our marketed products can be realized, we (or our collaborators) must overcome a number of hurdles which include successfully completing research and development and obtaining regulatory approval from the fda and regulatory authorities in other countries. in addition, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive, and new developments may render our products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete.
our ability to continue to generate profits and to generate positive cash flow from operations over the next several years depends significantly on our continued success in commercializing eylea. we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses related to our research and development activities, a significant portion of which we expect to be reimbursed by our collaborators. also, our research and development activities outside our collaborations, the costs of which are not reimbursed, are expected to expand and require additional resources. we also expect to incur substantial costs related to the commercialization of praluent and preparation for potential commercialization of sarilumab and dupixent, approximately half of which we expect to be reimbursed by sanofi under the companies' collaboration agreement. our financial results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on, among other factors, the net sales of our marketed products, the scope and progress of our research and development efforts, the timing of certain expenses, the continuation of our collaborations, in particular with sanofi and bayer, including our share of collaboration profits or losses from sales of commercialized products and the amount of reimbursement of our research and development expenses that we receive from collaborators, and the amount of income tax expense we incur, which is partly dependent on the profits or losses we earn in each of the countries in which we operate. we cannot predict whether or when new products or new indications for marketed products will receive regulatory approval or, if any such approval is received, whether we will be able to successfully commercialize such product(s) and whether or when they may become profitable.
critical accounting policies and use of estimates a summary of the significant accounting policies that impact us is provided in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (gaap) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the financial statements. management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:
•   it requires an assumption (or assumptions) regarding a future outcome; and
•   changes in the estimate or the use of different assumptions to prepare the estimate could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate. however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, and in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. the critical accounting estimates that impact our consolidated financial statements are described below.
revenue recognition product revenue product sales consist of u.s. sales of eylea and arcalyst. revenue from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title to product and associated risk of loss have passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, collection from the customer is reasonably assured, we have no further performance obligations, and returns can be reasonably estimated. we record revenue from product sales upon delivery to our distributors and specialty pharmacies (collectively, our customers).
revenue from product sales is recorded net of applicable provisions for rebates and chargebacks under governmental and other programs, such as medicaid and veterans' administration (va), distribution-related fees, prompt pay discounts, and other sales-related deductions. we estimate reductions to product sales based upon contracts with customers and government agencies, statutorily-defined discounts applicable to government-funded programs, historical experience, estimated payer mix, inventory levels in the distribution channel, shelf life of the product, and other relevant factors. calculating these provisions involves estimates and judgments. we review our estimates of rebates, chargebacks, and other applicable provisions each period and record any necessary adjustments in the current period's net product sales. the following table summarizes the provisions, and credits/payments, for sales-related deductions.

collaboration revenue we earn collaboration revenue in connection with collaboration agreements to develop and commercialize product candidates and utilize our technology platforms. these arrangements may require us to deliver various rights, services, and/or goods across the entire life cycle of a product or product candidate. the terms of these agreements typically include that consideration be provided to us in the form of non-refundable up-front payments, research progress (milestone) payments, payments for development and commercialization activities, and sharing of profits or losses arising from the commercialization of products. in arrangements involving multiple deliverables, we must determine whether each deliverable qualifies as a separate unit of accounting, whether the deliverables have value to the collaborator on a standalone basis, and how the consideration should be allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable. payments which are based on achieving a specific substantive performance milestone, involving a degree of risk, are recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved and the related payment is due and non-refundable, provided there is no future service obligation associated with that milestone. in determining whether a payment is deemed to be a substantive performance milestone, we take into consideration (i) the enhancement in value to the related development product candidate, (ii) our performance and the relative level of effort required to achieve the milestone, (iii) whether the milestone relates solely to past performance, and (iv) whether the milestone payment is considered reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms. payments for achieving milestones which are not considered substantive are deferred and recognized over the related performance period.
in connection with non-refundable licensing payments, our performance period estimates are principally based on projections of the scope, progress, and results of our research and development activities. due to the variability in the scope of activities and length of time necessary to develop a drug product, changes to development plans as programs progress, and uncertainty in the ultimate requirements to obtain governmental approval for commercialization, revisions to performance period estimates are likely to occur periodically, and could result in material changes to the amount of revenue recognized each year in the future. in addition, our estimated performance periods may change if development programs encounter delays, or we and our collaborators decide to expand or contract our clinical plans for a drug candidate in various disease indications.
when we are entitled to reimbursement of all or a portion of the research and development expenses that we incur under a collaboration, we record those reimbursable amounts as collaboration revenue proportionately as we recognize our expenses. if the collaboration is a cost-sharing arrangement in which both we and our collaborator perform development work and share costs, we also recognize, as research and development expense in the period when our collaborator incurs development expenses, the portion of the collaborator's development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse. our collaborators provide us with estimated development expenses for the most recent fiscal quarter. our collaborators' estimates are reconciled to their actual expenses for such quarter in the subsequent fiscal quarter, and our portion of our collaborators' development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse is adjusted on a prospective basis accordingly, as necessary.
under our collaboration agreements, product sales and cost of sales for products which are currently approved are recorded by our collaborators. we share in any profits or losses arising from the commercialization of such products. our collaborator provides us with our estimated share of the profits or losses from commercialization of such products for the most recent fiscal quarter. our collaborators' estimates of profits or losses for such quarter are reconciled to actual profits or losses in the subsequent fiscal quarter, and our share of the profit or loss is adjusted on a prospective basis accordingly, as necessary.
68
clinical trial expenses clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third-party contractors. we outsource a substantial portion of our clinical trial activities, utilizing external entities such as cros, independent clinical investigators, and other third-party service providers to assist us with the execution of our clinical studies. for each clinical trial that we conduct, certain clinical trial costs are expensed immediately, while others are expensed over time based on the expected total number of patients in the trial, the rate at which patients enter the trial, and/or the period over which clinical investigators or cros are expected to provide services.
clinical activities which relate principally to clinical sites and other administrative functions to manage our clinical trials are performed primarily by cros. cros typically perform most of the start-up activities for our trials, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training, and program management. on a budgeted basis, these start-up costs are typically 10% to 20% of the total contract value. on an actual basis, this percentage range can be significantly wider, as many of our contracts with cros are either expanded or reduced in scope compared to the original budget, while start-up costs for the particular trial may not change materially. these start-up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are event driven in nature. the remaining activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study. in the event of early termination of a clinical trial, we accrue and recognize expenses in an amount based on our estimate of the remaining non-cancelable obligations associated with the winding down of the clinical trial and/or penalties.
for clinical study sites, where payments are made periodically on a per-patient basis to the institutions performing the clinical study, we accrue expenses on an estimated cost-per-patient basis, based on subject enrollment and activity in each quarter. the amount of clinical study expense recognized in a quarter may vary from period to period based on the duration and progress of the study, the activities to be performed by the sites each quarter, the required level of patient enrollment, the rate at which patients actually enroll in and drop-out of the clinical study, and the number of sites involved in the study. clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in estimates are typically those that have a significant number of sites, require a large number of patients, have complex patient screening requirements, and span multiple years. during the course of a trial, we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates. our estimates and assumptions for clinical expense recognition could differ significantly from our actual results, which could cause material increases or decreases in research and development expenses in future periods when the actual results become known.
stock-based compensation we recognize stock-based compensation expense for grants of stock option awards and restricted stock under our long-term incentive plans to employees and non-employee members of our board of directors based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. the grant-date fair value of an award is generally recognized as compensation expense over the award's requisite service period.
we use the black-scholes model to compute the estimated fair value of stock option awards. using this model, fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to (i) expected volatility of our common stock price, (ii) the periods of time over which employees and members of our board of directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise (expected lives), (iii) expected dividend yield on our common stock, and (iv) risk-free interest rates, which are based on quoted u.s. treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the options' expected lives. expected volatility has been estimated based on actual movements in our stock price over the most recent historical periods equivalent to the options' expected lives. expected lives are principally based on our historical exercise experience with previously issued employee and board of directors option grants. the expected dividend yield is zero as we have never paid dividends and do not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future. stock-based compensation expense also includes an estimate, which is made at the time of grant, of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited. this estimate is revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
the assumptions used in computing the fair value of option awards reflect our best estimates but involve uncertainties related to market and other conditions, many of which are outside of our control. changes in any of these assumptions may materially affect the fair value of stock options granted and the amount of stock-based compensation recognized in future periods.
69
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts ("temporary differences") at enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. we periodically re-assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based on various factors including our historical earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, and forecasts of future operating results and utilization of net operating losses and tax credits prior to their expiration. significant judgment is required in making this assessment.
uncertain tax positions, for which management's assessment is that there is more than a 50% probability of sustaining the position upon challenge by a taxing authority based upon its technical merits, are subjected to certain recognition and measurement criteria. significant judgment is required in making this assessment, and therefore, we re-evaluate uncertain tax positions and consider various factors, including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. we adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the uncertain positions.
inventories we capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval when, based on management's judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized; otherwise, such costs are expensed as research and development. the determination to capitalize inventory costs is based on various factors, including status and expectations of the regulatory approval process, any known safety or efficacy concerns, potential labeling restrictions, and any other impediments to obtaining regulatory approval.
we periodically analyze our inventory levels to identify inventory that may expire prior to expected sale or has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value, and write-down such inventories as appropriate. in addition, our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process. if certain batches or units of product no longer meet quality specifications or become obsolete due to expiration, we record a charge to cost of goods sold to write down such unmarketable inventory to its estimated realizable value. in 2016, 2015, and 2014, cost of goods sold included inventory write-downs and reserves totaling $14.0 million, $10.6 million, and $6.0 million, respectively.
contingencies we accrue, based on management's judgment, for an estimated loss when the potential loss from claims or legal proceedings is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. as additional information becomes available, or based on specific events such as the outcome of litigation or settlement of claims, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation, and may change our estimates.

in 2016, sanofi's reimbursement of our antibody research and development expenses consisted of $130.0 million under our antibody discovery agreement and $434.9 million under our license and collaboration agreement, compared to $145.0 million and $590.4 million, respectively, in 2015, and $160.0 million and $387.8 million, respectively, in 2014. under the amended antibody discovery agreement, sanofi agreed to fund our antibody discovery activities up to $130.0 million, $145.0 million, and $160.0 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. the lower reimbursement of research and development costs under our license and collaboration agreement in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to decreased collaboration development activities for praluent, dupilumab, and regn2222. in 2016, sanofi no longer co-develops and reimburses us for development activities for regn2222. the higher reimbursement of development costs in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to increased development activities for dupilumab.
reimbursement of regeneron commercialization-related expenses represents reimbursement of internal and external costs in connection with preparing to commercialize or commercializing, as applicable, praluent, sarilumab, and, effective in the first quarter of 2016, dupilumab.
in 2014, we and sanofi began sharing commercial expenses related to praluent and sarilumab in accordance with the companies' license and collaboration agreement. in addition, effective in the first quarter of 2016, we and sanofi also began sharing pre-launch commercialization expenses related to dupilumab. as such, during the same periods in which we recorded reimbursements from sanofi related to our commercialization expenses, we also recorded our share of losses in connection with the companies preparing to commercialize or commercializing, as applicable, praluent, sarilumab, and dupilumab within sanofi collaboration revenue. our share of losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to higher commercialization expenses in connection with the ongoing launch of praluent, and higher expenses in connection with preparing to commercialize sarilumab and dupilumab. our share of losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily in connection with launching praluent in the united states. in 2016, net product sales of praluent in the united states were $94.4 million and net product sales of praluent outside of the united states were $21.9 million. in 2015, net product sales of praluent in the united states were $9.5 million and net product sales of praluent outside of the united states were $1.0 million.
in july 2015, we and sanofi entered into a global strategic collaboration to discover, develop, and commercialize antibody-based cancer treatments in the field of immuno-oncology. in 2016, sanofi's reimbursement of our immuno-oncology research and
72
development expenses consisted of $86.5 million under our io discovery agreement and $52.0 million under our io license and collaboration agreement related to regn2810, compared to $29.2 million and $10.8 million, respectively in 2015.
other sanofi immuno-oncology revenue includes recognition of deferred revenue from $640.0 million of up-front payments received in the third quarter of 2015 in connection with the execution of the io collaboration agreements. as of december 31, 2016, $520.0 million of the up-front payments was deferred and will be recognized ratably as revenue in future periods.
in february 2015, we entered into an amended zaltrap agreement with sanofi which amended and restated the zaltrap collaboration agreement. under the amended zaltrap agreement, sanofi is solely responsible for the development and commercialization of zaltrap. as a result, in the first quarter of 2015, we recognized $14.9 million of collaboration revenue, which was previously recorded as deferred revenue under the original zaltrap collaboration agreement, related to (i) amounts that were previously reimbursed by sanofi for manufacturing commercial supplies of zaltrap since our risk of inventory loss no longer existed, and (ii) the unamortized portion of up-front payments from sanofi as we had no further performance obligations.

bayer records revenue from sales of eylea outside the united states. our share of the profit we earned from commercialization of eylea outside the united states was partly offset by our contractual obligation to reimburse bayer for a portion of the agreed-upon development expenses previously incurred by bayer.
in 2015, we earned our final $15.0 million sales milestone from bayer, upon total aggregate net sales of specific commercial supplies of eylea outside the united states exceeding $200.0 million over a twelve-month period. in 2014, we earned seven $15.0 million sales milestones from bayer upon total aggregate net sales of eylea outside the united states achieving certain specified levels.
cost-sharing of our global eylea development expenses with bayer decreased in 2015 compared to 2014. in january 2014, bayer decided to participate in the global development and commercialization of eylea outside the united states for the treatment of macular edema following brvo. in connection with this decision, bayer reimbursed us $15.7 million for a defined share of the eylea global development costs that we had incurred prior to february 2014 for the brvo indication, which was recognized as bayer collaboration revenue in the first quarter of 2014. in addition, all future agreed-upon global eylea development expenses incurred in connection with brvo are shared equally, and any future profits or losses on sales of eylea outside of the united states for the treatment of macular edema following brvo are also shared (for countries other than japan; we are entitled to receive a tiered percentage of eylea net sales in japan).
other eylea revenue primarily consists of reimbursement of other regeneron eylea expenses, including reimbursements for producing eylea commercial supplies for bayer. in addition, other eylea revenue in the first five months of 2016 and for the full year of 2015 and 2014 includes bayer's share of royalties payable to genentech pursuant to a license and settlement agreement in connection with sales of eylea outside the united states; the obligation to pay genentech royalties on such sales ended in may 2016. other eylea revenue also includes recognition of deferred revenue related to eylea up-front and 2007 non-substantive milestone payments from bayer.
cost-sharing of regn2176-3 development expenses with bayer commenced in the first quarter of 2014 following the execution of the companies' pdgfr-beta antibody collaboration agreement. under the agreement, we conduct the initial development of the pdgfr-beta antibody through completion of the first proof-of-concept study, and bayer is obligated to pay 25% of global development costs and 50% of development costs exclusively for the territory outside the united states. other pdgfr-beta antibody revenue consists of recognition of deferred revenue related to the pdgfr-beta up-front payment and non-substantive milestones received in the first quarter of 2014. as described above under item 1. "business - clinical programs - ophthalmologic diseases - eylea - ophthalmologic diseases", we discontinued clinical development of regn2176-3 in the first quarter of 2017.
as described above under "collaboration agreements - collaborations with bayer - ang2 antibody outside the united states," in march 2016, we entered into an agreement with bayer governing the joint development and commercialization outside the united states of nesvacumab, an antibody product candidate to ang2, including in combination with aflibercept, for the treatment of ocular diseases or disorders. in connection with the agreement, bayer made a $50.0 million non-refundable up-front payment to us, which was recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized as revenue over the related performance period. bayer is also obligated to pay 25% of global development costs and 50% of development costs exclusively for the territory outside the united states.
other revenue as described in the "collaboration agreements" section above, in september 2015, we entered into a fasinumab collaboration agreement with mtpc, and, in september 2016, we entered into a fasinumab collaboration agreement with teva. in connection with our fasinumab collaborations with mtpc and teva, we recognized $14.4 million and $37.9 million, respectively, of other revenue during 2016. revenue recognized during 2015 in connection with our fasinumab collaboration with mtpc was not material.
under the terms of the amended zaltrap agreement, sanofi bears the cost of all development and commercialization activities and reimburses regeneron for its costs for any such activities. sanofi pays us a percentage of aggregate net sales of zaltrap during each calendar year of between 15% to 30%, depending on the aggregate net sales of zaltrap in such calendar year. in connection with the february 2015 amended zaltrap agreement, in 2016 we recorded $26.2 million of revenue primarily related to a percentage of net sales of zaltrap that sanofi is obligated to pay us and manufacturing zaltrap commercial supplies for sanofi. in 2015, we recorded $38.8 million of revenue in connection with the amended zaltrap agreement primarily related to manufacturing zaltrap commercial supplies for sanofi and a percentage of net sales of zaltrap from july 1, 2014 (the effective date of the amended zaltrap agreement) through december 31, 2015, which sanofi is obligated to pay us.

in connection with the amendment and extension of our velocimmune license agreement with astellas, in august 2010, we received a $165.0 million up-front payment, which was deferred upon receipt and is being recognized as revenue ratably over a seven-year period beginning in june 2011. in each of 2016, 2015, and 2014, we recognized $23.6 million of revenue related to this agreement. in addition, under a june 2009 agreement with novartis, we receive royalties on worldwide sales of novartis' ilaris (canakinumab). in 2016, 2015, and 2014, other revenue included $11.3 million, $8.9 million, and $7.9 million, respectively, of royalties from novartis.
expenses total operating expenses increased to $3,529.7 million in 2016, from $2,851.8 million in 2015 and $1,995.6 million in 2014. our average headcount in 2016 increased to 4,927 from 3,713 in 2015 and 2,629 in 2014, principally in connection with expanding our research and development, manufacturing, and commercialization activities.
operating expenses in 2016, 2015, and 2014, included a total of $559.9 million, $459.0 million, and $321.8 million, respectively, of non-cash compensation expense related to employee stock option and restricted stock awards (non-cash compensation expense). the increase in total non-cash compensation expense was primarily attributable to the higher fair market value of our common stock on the date of our annual employee option grants made in december 2015 and 2014 compared to prior years. as of december 31, 2016, unrecognized non-cash compensation expense related to outstanding stock options was $888.0 million and unvested restricted stock awards was $26.0 million. we expect to recognize this non-cash compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock awards over weighted-average periods of 1.9 years and 1.2 years, respectively.
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to $2,052.3 million in 2016, from $1,620.6 million in 2015 and $1,271.4 million in 2014. the following table summarizes the major categories of our research and development expenses:

(3) under our collaborations with bayer and sanofi, in periods when bayer or sanofi incurs certain development expenses, we also recognize, as research and development expense, the portion of our collaborators' development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse.
payroll and benefits increased principally due to the increase in employee headcount and non-cash compensation expense, as described above. clinical trial expenses increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the initiation of additional clinical studies of fasinumab and regn2810, and continued enrollment in clinical studies of these two antibody product candidates, partly offset by lower costs in connection with our dupilumab clinical program as some later-stage studies were completed. clinical trial expenses increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to additional costs for clinical studies of dupilumab and fasinumab, partly offset by lower praluent, eylea, and trevogrumab costs. clinical manufacturing costs increased in 2016 compared to 2015
75
primarily due to costs related to manufacturing additional drug supplies of dupilumab, fasinumab, and regn2810, partly offset by lower costs related to manufacturing less clinical supplies of praluent. clinical manufacturing costs increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to additional costs related to manufacturing drug supplies of dupilumab and, to a lesser extent, other late-stage antibody product candidates. research, licensing, and other development costs increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the $75.0 million up-front payment made in connection with the april 2016 license and collaboration agreement with intellia, the $25.0 million up-front payment made in connection with the july 2016 license and collaboration agreement with adicet, and an increase in lab supplies in connection with early stage research activities. research and other development costs decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to our 50% share ($33.8 million) of the cost of purchasing an fda priority review voucher in 2014, partly offset by an increase in lab supplies in connection with early stage research activities. cost-sharing of bayer and sanofi development expenses increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to our obligation to fund 20% of sanofi's phase 3 dupilumab development costs, which commenced during the first quarter of 2016, partly offset by lower development costs incurred by sanofi and bayer in connection with other shared programs. cost-sharing of bayer and sanofi development expenses decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower development costs incurred by bayer in connection with eylea and sanofi in connection with sarilumab.
we prepare estimates of research and development costs for projects in clinical development, which include direct costs and allocations of certain costs such as indirect labor, non-cash compensation expense, and manufacturing and other costs related to activities that benefit multiple projects, and, under our collaborations with bayer and sanofi, the portion of bayer's and sanofi's respective development expenses which they incur and we are obligated to reimburse. our estimates of research and development costs for clinical development programs are shown below:

drug development and approval in the united states is a multi-step process regulated by the fda. the process begins with discovery and preclinical evaluation, leading up to the submission of an ind to the fda which, if successful, allows the opportunity for study in humans, or clinical study, of the potential new drug. clinical development typically involves three phases of study: phases 1, 2, and 3. the most significant costs in clinical development are in phase 3 clinical trials, as they tend to be the longest and largest studies in the drug development process. following successful completion of phase 3 clinical trials for a biological product, a bla must be submitted to, and accepted by, the fda and the fda must approve the bla prior to commercialization of the drug. it is not uncommon for the fda to request additional data following its review of a bla, which can significantly increase the drug development timeline and expenses. we may elect either on our own, or at the request of the fda, to conduct further studies that are referred to as phase 3b and 4 studies. phase 3b studies are initiated and either completed or substantially completed while the bla is under fda review. these studies are conducted under an ind. phase 4 studies, also referred to as post-marketing studies, are studies that are initiated and conducted after the fda has approved a product for marketing. in addition, as discovery research, preclinical development, and clinical programs progress, opportunities to expand development of drug candidates into new disease indications can emerge. we may elect to add such new disease indications to our development efforts (with the approval of our collaborator for joint development programs), thereby extending the period in which we will be developing a product.
76
there are numerous uncertainties associated with drug development, including uncertainties related to safety and efficacy data from each phase of drug development, uncertainties related to the enrollment and performance of clinical trials, changes in regulatory requirements, changes in the competitive landscape affecting a product candidate, and other risks and uncertainties described in part i, item 1a, "risk factors." the lengthy process of seeking fda approvals, and subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. any failure by us to obtain, or delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business.
for these reasons and due to the variability in the costs necessary to develop a pharmaceutical product and the uncertainties related to future indications to be studied, the estimated cost and scope of the projects, and our ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization, accurate and meaningful estimates of the total cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available. similarly, we are unable to reasonably estimate if our product candidates in clinical development will generate material product revenues and net cash inflows.
selling, general, and administrative expenses selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to $1,177.7 million in 2016 from $838.5 million in 2015 primarily due to (i) higher commercialization-related expenses associated with praluent and higher commercialization-related expenses in connection with preparing to launch sarilumab and dupilumab, (ii) higher contributions to not-for-profit organizations, including donations to independent not-for-profit patient assistance organizations, (iii) higher headcount and headcount-related costs, and (iv) higher non-cash compensation expense principally for the reason described under "expenses" above. selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to $838.5 million in 2015 from $519.3 million in 2014 primarily due to higher headcount and headcount-related costs, higher non-cash compensation expense principally for the reason described under "expenses" above, and higher commercialization-related expenses primarily associated with eylea and praluent. selling, general, and administrative expenses included $231.2 million, $193.0 million, and $134.7 million of non-cash compensation expense in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
selling, general and administrative expenses in 2014 included a $40.6 million incremental charge related to the branded prescription drug fee, which is a non-tax deductible annual fee imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs. in july 2014, the internal revenue service (irs) issued final regulations that provide guidance on the branded prescription drug fee. as a result of the issuance of these final irs regulations, an incremental charge was recorded to (i) recognize a liability for the estimated fee payable based on 2014 sales through the first nine months of 2014, and (ii) expense the remaining prepaid asset recorded under the previous accounting for the estimated fee payable based on 2013 sales. the impact of the 2014 incremental charge was offset by a higher branded prescription drug fee expense in 2015 due to higher sales of eylea in the united states.
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold decreased to $194.6 million in 2016 from $241.7 million in 2015. cost of goods sold primarily consists of costs in connection with producing u.s. eylea commercial supplies, various start-up costs in connection with our limerick, ireland commercial manufacturing facility, and royalties. cost of goods sold decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 principally due to the fact that, effective may 2016, we are no longer obligated to pay royalties to genentech based on u.s. sales of eylea. this decrease was partly offset by an increase in limerick start-up costs and an increase in u.s. eylea net sales. cost of goods sold increased to $241.7 million in 2015 from $129.0 million in 2014 principally due to the increase in u.s. eylea net sales, as well as an increase in limerick start-up costs. in 2016, 2015, and 2014, cost of goods sold included inventory write-downs and reserves totaling $14.0 million, $10.6 million, and $6.0 million, respectively.
cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing, which includes costs we incur in connection with producing commercial drug supplies for sanofi and bayer, decreased to $105.1 million in 2016 from $151.0 million in 2015. this decrease was primarily due to lower royalties since our obligation to pay genentech based on sales of eylea outside the united states also ended in may 2016.
cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing increased to $151.0 million in 2015 from $76.0 million in 2014. this increase was primarily due to the recognition of costs associated with commercial supplies of zaltrap, as well as royalties payable to genentech in connection with higher sales of eylea outside the united states and the recognition of costs associated with commercial supplies of eylea manufactured for bayer. under our collaboration arrangements, when the product is sold by our collaborators to third-party customers, our risk of inventory loss no longer exists, and we therefore recognize our related manufacturing costs for the sold product as cost of collaboration manufacturing. however, in february 2015, we entered into an amended zaltrap agreement with sanofi. as a result, in the first quarter of 2015, we recognized as expense $20.2 million of inventoried costs for zaltrap commercial supplies that were previously shipped to sanofi because our risk of inventory loss no longer exists under the amended zaltrap agreement.
77
other income (expense)
total other expenses (net of other income) in 2016 decreased compared to 2015 primarily due to (i) recognition of a $0.5 million and $18.9 million loss in 2016 and 2015, respectively, in connection with notes which were surrendered for conversion during the respective periods, (ii) a decrease in interest expense related to conversions of a substantial portion of the notes in 2015, and (iii) an increase in investment income on our marketable securities, partly offset by a 2016 other-than-temporary impairment charge of $9.8 million related to our investment in adverum biotechnologies, inc. (formerly avalanche biotechnologies, inc.) common shares. the common shares of adverum were previously acquired in connection with our research collaboration and license agreement with adverum.
total other expenses (net of other income) decreased to $26.8 million in 2015 from $62.7 million in 2014. interest expense in 2015 decreased compared to 2014 primarily due to conversions of a substantial portion of our notes in 2014 and 2015. in addition, in 2015 and 2014, we recognized a $18.9 million and a $33.5 million non-cash charge, respectively, in connection with notes which were surrendered for conversion during the respective periods.
income taxes in 2016, we recorded income tax expense of $434.3 million, based on an effective tax rate of 32.7%. the 2016 effective tax rate was positively impacted, compared to the u.s. federal statutory rate, by the tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation, the domestic manufacturing deduction, and the federal tax credit for research activities, offset by the negative impact of losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions with rates lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate and the non-tax deductible branded prescription drug fee. as described in note 1 and note 16 of our consolidated financial statements, during 2016 we adopted accounting standards update 2016-09, which requires an entity to recognize all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in connection with stock-based compensation as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement (previously, excess tax benefits were recognized in additional paid-in capital).
in 2015, we recorded income tax expense of $589.0 million, based on an effective tax rate of 48.1%. the 2015 effective tax rate was negatively impacted, compared to the u.s. federal statutory rate, by losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions with rates lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate, partly offset by the positive impact of the domestic manufacturing deduction.
in 2014, we recorded income tax expense of $423.1 million, based on an effective tax rate of 55.6%. the 2014 effective tax rate was negatively impacted, compared to the u.s. federal statutory rate, by losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions with rates lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate and the non-tax deductible branded prescription drug fee. the negative impact of these items was partly offset by the positive impact of the federal tax credit for increased research activities and state income state credits.

sources and uses of cash for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014
cash flows from operating activities
2016. net cash provided by operating activities was $1,473.4 million in 2016. our net income in 2016 included non-cash compensation expense of $559.9 million. deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2016 increased by $360.1 million, compared to december 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation, the tax basis of intangible assets, and deferred revenue.
inventories as of december 31, 2016 increased by $149.8 million, compared to december 31, 2015, primarily due to increased production of commercial supplies of our drug products and preparing for commercial production to commence at our limerick, ireland facility. deferred revenue increased by $244.3 million as of december 31, 2016, compared to december 31, 2015, primarily due to $250.0 million and $60.0 million of payments received during 2016 from teva and mitsubishi, respectively, in connection with the companies' respective fasinumab collaborations, and the $50.0 million up-front payment from bayer in connection with the companies' ang2 collaboration, partly offset primarily by the amortization of these 2016 payments and past up-front payments from sanofi. accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities increased by $254.0 million as of december 31, 2016, compared to december 31, 2015, primarily due to higher tax related liabilities.
2015. net cash provided by operating activities was $1,330.8 million in 2015. our net income in 2015 included non-cash compensation expense of $459.0 million. in addition, deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2015 increased by $121.6 million, compared to december 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase in non-cash compensation expense, partly offset by a reduction in our deferred tax assets related to fixed assets and deferred revenue.
inventories as of december 31, 2015 increased by $111.8 million, compared to december 31, 2014, primarily due to increased production of eylea commercial supplies as well as capitalization of inventory in connection with praluent production. prepaid expenses and other assets increased by $79.5 million as of december 31, 2015, compared to december 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase in prepaid income taxes. deferred revenue increased by $608.9 million as of december 31, 2015, compared to december 31, 2014, primarily due to $640.0 million of up-front payments received from sanofi in connection with the companies' io collaboration, partly offset by related amortization which commenced in the third quarter of 2015. accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities increased by $303.7 million as of december 31, 2015, compared to december 31, 2014, primarily due to (i) higher accruals for sales-related charges and deductions, and royalties related to eylea, (ii) higher expenditures in connection with our expanding research and development activities, (iii) higher payroll and payroll-related costs, and (iv) higher tax-related liabilities.
2014. net cash provided by operating activities was $752.4 million in 2014. our net income in 2014 included non-cash compensation expense of $321.8 million and a $33.5 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the conversion of our notes during 2014. in addition, deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2014 increased by $53.3 million, compared to end-of-year 2013, primarily due to an increase in non-cash compensation expense partly offset by the reduction of our deferred tax assets related to the recently enacted new york state tax legislation, which reduced our new york state income tax rate to zero percent effective in 2014.
as of december 31, 2014, sanofi, bayer, and trade accounts receivable increased by $34.9 million, compared to end-of-year 2013, primarily due to higher amounts receivable from bayer in connection with the commercialization of eylea outside of the united states, partly offset by lower trade accounts receivable resulting from shortened payment terms to certain of our u.s. eylea customers effective january 2014. accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities increased by $161.2 million as of december 31, 2014, compared to end-of-year 2013, primarily due to (i) higher accruals for sales-related charges (including the impact of the branded prescription drug fee incremental charge as described above), deductions, and royalties related to eylea, (ii) higher payroll-related liabilities primarily driven by an increase in headcount, and (iii) higher expenditures in connection with our expanding research and development activities.
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $1,046.9 million, $907.6 million, and $420.8 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. in 2016, 2015, and 2014, purchases of marketable securities exceeded sales or maturities by $535.0 million, $229.7 million, and $87.8 million, respectively. capital expenditures were $511.9 million, $677.9 million, and $333.0 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. capital expenditures in 2016 primarily included costs in connection with renovations of our limerick, ireland manufacturing facility, renovations and additions to certain areas of our rensselaer, new york manufacturing facilities, the purchase of office buildings near our rensselaer manufacturing facilities and tarrytown facilities, and purchases of equipment.
79
we expect to incur capital expenditures of $375 million to $450 million in 2017 primarily in connection with continued renovations of our limerick, ireland facility, expanding our tarrytown, new york facilities, and expanding and renovating a portion of our manufacturing facilities at our rensselaer, new york facility.
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities was $700.4 million, $262.8 million, and $218.5 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. in 2016, 2015, and 2014, $12.9 million, $166.5 million, and $220.6 million principal amount of our notes, respectively, that was previously surrendered for conversion was settled in cash. also during 2016, 2015, and 2014, we paid an aggregate amount of $643.4 million, $573.5 million, and $294.6 million, respectively, to warrant holders to reduce the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants. proceeds from issuances of common stock, in connection with exercises of employee stock options, were $126.7 million in 2016, compared to $206.4 million in 2015 and $126.0 million in 2014. in 2015 and 2014, cash flows from financing activities included $405.3 million and $439.3 million, respectively, due to utilization of excess tax benefits in connection with stock option exercises, which offset cash tax obligations. in 2016, we elected to adopt accounting standards update 2016-09, compensation - stock compensation, improvements to employee share-based payment accounting; consequently, we began to record excess tax benefits as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows.
convertible senior notes in october 2011, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes in a private placement. the notes paid interest semi-annually on april 1 and october 1, and any notes that were not converted earlier matured on october 1, 2016. the notes were convertible, subject to certain conditions, into cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our option. see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.
in connection with the initial offering of the notes, we entered into convertible note hedge (call option) and warrant transactions with multiple counterparties. the convertible note hedge covered the number of shares of our common stock that initially underlie the notes, and were intended to reduce the potential dilutive impact of the conversion feature of the notes. the convertible note hedge also terminated upon the maturity date of the notes. the warrants were to become exercisable at various dates during 2017; however, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we entered into agreements with warrant holders to cancel any remaining warrants held by the warrant holders and to terminate the respective warrant agreements. see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.
credit facility in march 2015, we entered into an agreement with a syndicate of lenders (the credit agreement) which provides for a $750.0 million senior unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the credit facility). the credit agreement includes an option for us to elect to increase the commitments under the credit facility and/or to enter into one or more tranches of term loans in the aggregate principal amount of up to $250.0 million subject to the consent of the lenders providing the additional commitments or term loans, as applicable, and certain other conditions. proceeds of the loans under the credit facility may be used to finance working capital needs, and for general corporate or other lawful purposes, of regeneron and its subsidiaries. the credit agreement also provides a $100.0 million sublimit for letters of credit. the credit agreement includes an option for us to elect to extend the maturity date of the credit facility beyond march 2020, subject to the consent of the extending lenders and certain other conditions. amounts borrowed under the credit facility may be prepaid, and the commitments under the credit facility may be terminated, at any time without premium or penalty. we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of december 31, 2016.
effective december 30, 2016, the credit agreement has been amended in connection with our proposed acquisition of the facility (as described under "tarrytown, new york leases" below) and the related lease financing contemplated by us to provide that such lease financing and certain other lease or similar arrangements shall not constitute "indebtedness" or "capital lease obligations" for purposes of the credit agreement, including for purposes of calculating our total leverage ratio thereunder.
the credit agreement contains financial and operating covenants. financial covenants include a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest expense coverage ratio. we were in compliance with all covenants of the credit facility as of december 31, 2016.
80
license and settlement agreements with genentech as described above under item 1. "business - patents, trademarks, and trade secrets", in 2011 and 2013 we entered into license and settlement agreements with genentech. the agreements provided for us to make payments to genentech based on u.s. sales of eylea, as well as eylea manufactured in the united states and sold outside the united states, through may 7, 2016. eylea is sold outside the united states by affiliates of bayer under our license and collaboration agreement with bayer. under the terms of the genentech agreements, we were obligated to make a $60.0 million milestone payment and pay royalties of 4.75% on cumulative relevant sales of eylea between $400.0 million and $3.0 billion and 5.5% on cumulative relevant sales of eylea over $3.0 billion. all payments to genentech were made by regeneron, and bayer shared in all such payments based on the proportion of eylea sales outside the united states to worldwide eylea sales.
tarrytown, new york leases we currently lease approximately 1,180,000 square feet of laboratory and office space at facilities in tarrytown, new york. certain leased premises have historically been accounted for as operating leases. however, for certain other buildings that we lease (related to approximately 735,000 square feet), we are deemed, in substance, to be the owner of the landlord's buildings in accordance with the application of fasb authoritative guidance. consequently, in addition to capitalizing the tenant improvements, we capitalized the landlord's costs of constructing these new facilities, offset by a corresponding facility lease obligation. in addition, we recognized, as additional facility lease obligation, reimbursements from our landlord for tenant improvement costs that we incurred since, under fasb authoritative guidance, such payments that we received from our landlord are deemed to be a financing obligation. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, the facility lease obligation balance related to these buildings was $353.9 million and $364.7 million, respectively.
on december 30, 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement with bmr-landmark at eastview llc and bmr-landmark at eastview iv llc (collectively, bmr), pursuant to which we have agreed to purchase bmr's tarrytown, new york facilities (the facility), which includes the 1,180,000 square feet of laboratory and office space described above, for a purchase price of $720.0 million, subject to certain customary adjustments. we currently occupy a significant portion of the facility, with the remaining rentable area, or approximately 300,000 square feet, under leases to third-party tenants. in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement, we paid $57.0 million toward the purchase price to bmr in december 2016. the closing of the purchase agreement is anticipated in the first quarter of 2017.
we intend to fund the acquisition contemplated by the purchase agreement with a new financing. accordingly, we have entered into an engagement letter with banc of america leasing & capital, llc (bal), pursuant to which bal has been engaged to use its best efforts to arrange a $720.0 million lease financing in connection with the acquisition contemplated by the purchase agreement. as part of the contemplated financing, we intend to assign some or all our rights under the purchase agreement (including the right to take title to the facility) to an affiliate of bal at the closing of the financing, as a result of which such affiliate will become the legal owner of the facility (the lessor). upon assignment of our rights, we expect to be reimbursed by bal or an affiliate of bal for the $57.0 million payment we made in december 2016. immediately thereafter, we intend to lease the facility from the lessor for a term of five years. at the end of the lease term, we expect to have an option to extend the term of the lease (subject to the consent of the financing providers), purchase the facility at a predetermined amount, or sell the facility to a third party on behalf of the lessor.
funding requirements the amount we need to fund operations will depend on various factors, including revenues from net product sales, the potential regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates and the timing thereof, the status of competitive products, the success of our research and development programs, the potential future need to expand our professional and support staff and facilities, the status of patents and other intellectual property rights (and future litigation related thereto), the delay or failure of a clinical trial of any of our potential drug candidates, and the continuation, extent, and success of our collaborations (in particular those with sanofi and bayer). we believe that our existing capital resources, borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility, funds generated by anticipated eylea net product sales, and, as described above under "collaboration agreements," funding for reimbursement of research and development costs that we are entitled to receive under our collaboration agreements, will enable us to meet our projected operating needs for the foreseeable future.

(1)   purchase and other obligations primarily relate to research and development commitments, including those related to clinical trials, funding in connection with our sponsorship of the science talent search and other programs by the society for science &amp; the public, and capital expenditures. our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may increase or be reduced based on certain future events. open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the table above.
(2)   represents rent payments with respect to capital lease and facility lease obligations in connection with our property leases in tarrytown, new york, as described under "tarrytown, new york leases" above and note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. amounts in the table above exclude (i) potential future rent payments with respect to the lease we anticipate entering into in 2017, and (ii) the potential purchase price we would be obligated to pay if the anticipated financing pursuant to the engagement letter with bal is not obtained.
(3)   excludes future contingent costs for utilities, real estate taxes, and operating expenses.
liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, totaling $117.2 million at december 31, 2016, are not included in the table of contractual obligations above as, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the period of potential future cash settlement with taxing authorities. see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.
we expect continued increases in our expenditures, particularly in connection with our research and development activities (including preclinical and clinical programs). the amount of funding that will be required for our clinical programs depends upon the results of our research and preclinical programs and early-stage clinical trials, regulatory requirements, the duration and results of clinical trials underway and of additional clinical trials that we decide to initiate, and the various factors that affect the cost of each trial. as described within item 1. "business - collaboration agreements - collaborations with sanofi," pursuant to the antibody discovery agreement, as amended, sanofi is responsible for funding up to $130.0 million of our antibody discovery activities in 2017. unless sanofi, at its option, elects to extend antibody development and preclinical activities relating to selected programs, any future funding after 2017 from sanofi under the antibody discovery agreement will cease to continue. clinical trial costs are dependent, among other things, on the size and duration of trials (for example, we have several ongoing late-stage clinical trials which are large and for which we expect to incur significant costs), fees charged for services provided by clinical trial investigators and other third parties, the costs for manufacturing the product candidate for use in the trials, and for supplies, laboratory tests, and other expenses.
in addition to our anticipated commercialization costs for eylea and praluent, we anticipate incurring substantial commercialization costs in connection with our late-stage antibody product candidates, including sarilumab and dupilumab. commercialization costs over the next few years will depend on, among other things, whether or not our antibody product candidates in later stage clinical development receive regulatory approval, the market potential for product candidates, and the commercialization terms of our collaboration agreements, if applicable (whereby commercialization costs may be shared with our collaborators). currently, we are required to pay royalties on sales of certain commercial products. in the future, if we are able to successfully develop, market, and sell certain of our product candidates, we may be required to pay additional royalties or share the profits from such sales pursuant to our license or collaboration agreements. in addition, under the provisions of the ppaca and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010, the branded prescription drug fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs. this fee is allocated to companies, including regeneron, based on their market share of total branded prescription drug sales into these government programs.
we expect that expenses related to the filing, prosecution, defense, and enforcement of patents and other intellectual property will be substantial. in addition, as described above under item 3. "legal proceedings - proceedings relating to praluent (alirocumab) injection," the united states district court for the district of delaware issued a permanent injunction, which was stayed (suspended) pending appeal. if the injunction is upheld on appeal, it would prohibit us and the sanofi defendants from commercializing praluent
82
in the united states. if we and sanofi are not able to commercialize praluent in the united states, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows may be materially impacted.
we enter into research collaboration and licensing agreements that may require us to pay (i) amounts upon the achievement of various development and commercial milestones, which, in the aggregate, could be significant, and/or (ii) royalties calculated based on a percentage of net product sales. the payment of these amounts, however, is contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring and for which the specific timing cannot be predicted. because of these factors, such payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations above. see note 3 and note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.
under our antibody and io collaborations with sanofi and our collaboration with bayer for eylea outside the united states, we and our collaborator share profits and losses in connection with commercialization of drug products. profits or losses under each collaboration are measured by calculating net sales less cost of goods sold and shared commercialization and other expenses. if the applicable collaboration is profitable, we have contingent contractual obligations to reimburse sanofi and bayer for a defined percentage (generally 50%) of agreed-upon development expenses funded by sanofi and bayer. these reimbursements would be deducted each quarter, in accordance with a formula, from our share of the collaboration profits (and, for our eylea collaboration with bayer, our percentage on product sales in japan) otherwise payable to us, unless, in some cases, we elect to reimburse these expenses at a faster rate. in particular, as of december 31, 2016, our contingent reimbursement obligation to bayer for eylea was approximately $256 million and our contingent reimbursement obligation to sanofi in connection with the companies' antibody collaboration and io collaboration was approximately $2,245 million and $3 million, respectively. therefore, we expect that, for the foreseeable future, a portion of our share of profits from sales of eylea outside the united states and a portion of our share of profits, if any, from sales of praluent and, if approved, sarilumab, dupilumab, and other product candidates developed as part of the sanofi antibody and io collaborations will be used to reimburse our collaborator for these obligations.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

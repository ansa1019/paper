our 2016 financial results were as follows:
•   sales of $2.1 billion increased 5%, reflecting a 1% decrease in organic sales (excluding acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency translation), a 1% decrease due to foreign currency translation, and a 7% increase due to acquisitions/divestitures.
•   operating income of $405.8 million and operating margin of 19.2% were down 6% and 220 basis points, respectively, from the prior year.
•   net income decreased 4% to $271.1 million.
•   diluted eps of $3.53 decreased $0.09 or 2% compared to 2015.
our 2016 financial results, adjusted for $3.7 million of restructuring costs, a $3.6 million pension settlement charge and a $22.3 million loss on sale of businesses, compared to our 2015 financial results adjusted for $11.2 million of restructuring costs and an $18.1 million gain on sale of a business are as follows (these non-gaap measures have been reconciled to u.s. gaap measures in item 6, "selected financial data"):
•   adjusted operating income of $435.3 million and adjusted operating margin of 20.6% were up 2% and down 40 basis points, respectively, from the prior year.
17
•   adjusted net income increased 4% to $288.4 million.
•   adjusted eps of $3.75 was 6% higher than prior year adjusted eps of $3.55.
overall, we remain cautious due to the uncertainty within the global economy and the global political environment and project 1 to 2 percent organic growth in 2017. we expect to deliver full year 2017 eps of $3.87 to $3.95.
results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2016. for purposes of this item, reference is made to the consolidated statements of operations in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data." segment operating income excludes unallocated corporate operating expenses. management's primary measurements of segment performance are sales, operating income, and operating margin.
in the following discussion, and throughout this report, references to organic sales, a non-gaap measure, refers to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states but excludes (1) the impact of foreign currency translation and (2) sales from acquired or divested businesses during the first twelve months of ownership or divestiture. the portion of sales attributable to foreign currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in organic sales and (b) the period-to-period change in organic sales after applying prior period foreign exchange rates to the current year period. management believes that reporting organic sales provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. the company excludes the effect of foreign currency translation from organic sales because foreign currency translation is not under management's control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. the company excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because the nature, size, and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from period to period and between the company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.
performance in 2016 compared with 2015
(in thousands)                  2016                    2015          change net sales             $2,113,043              $2,020,668             5   %
operating income         405,801                 431,738            (6   )%
operating margin            19.2   %                21.4   %      (220   )     bps sales in 2016 were $2.1 billion, a 5% increase from last year. this increase reflects a 1% decrease in organic sales, a 1% decrease from foreign currency translation and a 7% increase from acquisitions/divestitures (acquisitions: sfc koenig - september 2016; awg fittings - july 2016; akron brass - march 2016; cidra precision services - july 2015; alfa valvole - june 2015 and novotema - june 2015. divestitures: cvi korea - december 2016; ietg - october 2016; cvi japan - september 2016; hydra-stop - july 2016 and ismatec - july 2015). sales to customers outside the u.s. represented approximately 50% of total sales in both 2016 and 2015.
in 2016, fluid & metering technologies contributed 40% of sales and 44% of operating income; health & science technologies contributed 35% of sales and 31% of operating income; and fire & safety/diversified products contributed 25% of sales and 25% of operating income.
gross profit of $930.8 million in 2016 increased $26.5 million, or 3%, from 2015, while gross margin decreased 80 basis points to 44.0% in 2016 from 44.8% in 2015. the increase in gross profit is primarily a result of increased sales volume as a result of acquisitions, while the margin decrease is mainly attributable to $14.7 million of fair value inventory step up charges from 2016 acquisitions compared to $3.4 million from 2015 acquisitions.
sg&a expenses increased to $499.0 million in 2016 from $479.4 million in 2015. the $19.6 million increase is mainly attributable to $41.4 million of incremental costs from new acquisitions and $3.6 million of pension settlement charges in 2016, partially offset by current year divestitures and cost savings from prior year restructuring actions. as a percentage of sales, sg&a expenses were 23.6% for 2016 and 23.7% for 2015.
during 2016, the company recorded a $22.3 million pre-tax loss on the sale of businesses related to the four divestitures during the year (hydra-stop - july 2016; cvi japan - september 2016; ietg - october 2016; and cvi korea - december 2016), compared to the $18.1 million pre-tax gain on the sale of a business in 2015 (ismatec - july 2015).
18
during 2016, the company recorded pre-tax restructuring expenses totaling $3.7 million as part of initiatives that support the implementation of key strategic efforts designed to facilitate long-term, sustainable growth through cost reduction actions primarily consisting of employee reductions and facility rationalization. in 2015, the company recorded $11.2 million of restructuring expenses mainly attributable to employee severance from headcount reductions across all three segments and corporate.
operating income of $405.8 million in 2016 decreased from $431.7 million in 2015, primarily resulted from the impact of the four divestitures in 2016 and the associated loss compared to the one divestiture in 2015 and the associated gain as well as the $3.6 million pension settlement charge in 2016 and the incremental fair value inventory step-up charges related to the 2016 acquisitions, partially offset by the reversal of $4.7 million of contingent consideration related to a 2015 acquisition and lower restructuring costs recorded in 2016 compared to 2015. operating margin of 19.2% in 2016 was down 220 basis points from 21.4% in 2015 primarily due to the loss on the sale of businesses in 2016 compared to a gain on the sale of a business in 2015, and the 2016 pension settlement, partially offset by productivity improvements and lower restructuring costs year over year.
other (income) expense increased $6.1 million from income of $2.2 million in 2015 to income of $8.3 million in 2016 mainly due to $4.7 million of foreign currency transaction gains on intercompany loans that were established in conjunction with the sfc koenig acquisition.
interest expense increased to $45.6 million in 2016 from $41.6 million in 2015. the increase was primarily due to the $200 million series of senior notes issued in 2016 and higher borrowings outstanding on the revolving facility.
the provision for income taxes is based upon estimated annual tax rates for the year applied to federal, state and foreign income. the provision for income taxes decreased to $97.4 million in 2016 compared to $109.5 million in 2015. the effective tax rate decreased to 26.4% in 2016 compared to 27.9% in 2015, due to tax benefits on the divestitures of cvi korea and cvi japan, certain return-to-provision adjustments and the early adoption of asu 2016-09 and the related tax effects of share based payments now recognized as a reduction to income tax expense. these adjustments were offset by the incurrence of additional foreign withholding taxes, the prior year revaluation of the italian deferred tax liability related to the reduction in the italian statutory tax rate and tax expense on the divestiture of the hydra-stop product line and the prior year divestiture of the ismatec product line as well as the mix of global pre-tax income among jurisdictions.
net income for the year of $271.1 million decreased from the $282.8 million in 2015. diluted earnings per share in 2016 of $3.53 decreased $0.09 from $3.62 in 2015.

sg&a expenses decreased to $479.4 million in 2015 from $504.4 million in 2014. the $25.0 million decrease is mainly attributable to a reduction in volume-related expenses of $35.1 million, partially offset by approximately $10.1 million of incremental costs from new acquisitions. as a percentage of sales, sg&a expenses were 23.7% for 2015 and 23.5% for 2014.
during 2015, the company recorded pre-tax restructuring expenses totaling $11.2 million compared to $13.7 million recorded in 2014. the restructuring expenses for both years were mainly attributable to employee severance related to head count reductions across all three segments and corporate.
operating income of $431.7 million in 2015 increased slightly from the $431.2 million recorded in 2014, primarily reflecting improved productivity offset by decreased volumes. operating margin of 21.4% in 2015 was up 130 basis points from 20.1% in 2014 primarily due to the gain on the sale of the ismatec product line and productivity improvements.
other (income) expense decreased $0.9 million from other income of $3.1 million in 2014 to $2.2 million of income in 2015 mainly due to mark-to-market gains in available for sale securities in 2014 compared to losses in 2015.
interest expense decreased slightly to $41.6 million in 2015 from $41.9 million in 2014. the decrease was primarily due to the maturation of the 2.58% senior euro notes, partially offset by a higher balance on the revolving facility.
the provision for income taxes is based upon estimated annual tax rates for the year applied to federal, state and foreign income. the provision for income taxes decreased to $109.5 million in 2015 compared to $113.1 million in 2014. the effective tax rate decreased to 27.9% in 2015 compared to 28.8% in 2014, due to the revaluation of the italian deferred tax liability related to the reduction in the italian statutory tax rate, the disposition of the ismatec product line and the mix of global pre-tax income among jurisdictions.
net income for the year of $282.8 million increased from the $279.4 million earned in 2014. diluted earnings per share in 2015 of $3.62 increased $0.17 from $3.45 in 2014.

21
sales within our energy platform decreased compared to 2014 primarily due to the fall in oil prices and the related delay in large capital projects in europe and the middle east. sales within our pumps platform (formerly industrial) similarly decreased compared to 2014 due to the fall in oil & gas prices, but also due to the weakening of the north american industrial distribution market. this decrease was partially offset by an increase in european chemical project activity. sales within our agriculture platform decreased as oem and after-market distribution sales fell significantly due to depressed commodity prices and lower farm incomes. the slight sales decrease in the water platform was driven by weakness in north american industrial markets, offset by growth in the global municipal markets and share gains from new products. sales in the valves platform, which was created in the third quarter of 2015, increased as a result of the alfa acquisition.
operating income and operating margin of $204.5 million and 23.8%; respectively, were lower than the $216.9 million and 24.1%; respectively, recorded in 2014, primarily due to the lower sales volume.

sales within our dispensing platform decreased due to the benefit of large projects in the first half of the prior year and softness in asian markets. the sales decrease in our band-it platform was driven by the decline of upstream oil & gas sales, due to depressed prices, slightly offset by continued strength in the north american transportation markets. sales within our fire & safety platform decreased due to prior year trailer sales for north american power production facilities, a lack of project orders in china and north america, and continued decision delays on municipal projects in europe and asia.
operating income of $115.7 million was lower than the $130.5 million recorded in 2014, while operating margin of 27.3% was higher than the 26.0% recorded in 2014, primarily due to favorable mix within the dispensing platform along with productivity improvements across the entire segment, partially offset by lower volume.

liquidity and capital resources operating activities cash flows from operating activities increased $39.6 million, or 11.0%, to $399.9 million in 2016, primarily due to the impact of current year acquisitions, lower bonus payments, early adoption of asu 2016-09, and improved operating working capital performance, partially offset by higher prepaid income taxes in 2016. at december 31, 2016, working capital was $513.6 million and the company's current ratio was 2.66 to 1. at december 31, 2016, the company's cash and cash equivalents totaled $236.0 million, of which $190.3 million was held outside of the united states.
investing activities cash flows used in investing activities increased $298.7 million to $509.2 million in 2016, primarily as a result of an additional $315.0 million of cash paid for acquisitions, partially offset by $11.4 million of higher proceeds from the sale of businesses and $5.5 million of lower capital expenditures.
cash flows from operations were more than adequate to fund capital expenditures of $38.2 million and $43.8 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. capital expenditures were generally for machinery and equipment that improved productivity, although a portion was for business system technology, replacement of equipment, and construction of new facilities. management believes that the company has ample capacity in its plants and equipment to meet demand increases for future growth in the intermediate term.
the company acquired akron brass in march 2016 for cash consideration of $221.4 million; awg fittings in july 2016 for cash consideration of $47.5 million (€42.8 million); and sfc koenig in september 2016 for cash consideration of $241.1 million (€215.9 million). the purchase prices for the 2016 acquisitions were funded with both cash on hand and borrowings under the company's revolving facilities. the company acquired novotema in may 2015 for cash consideration of $61.1 million (€56 million); alfa valvole in june 2015 for cash consideration of $112.6 million (€99.8 million); and cps in july 2015 for cash consideration of $19.5 million and non-cash contingent consideration valued at $4.7 million. the entire purchase price for all of the 2015 acquisitions was funded with cash on hand.
financing activities cash flows from financing activities increased from $295.5 million of cash used in financing activities in 2015 to $46.5 million of cash provided by financing activities in 2016, primarily as a result of the company paying off the $88.4 million balance on the 2.58% senior euro notes in 2015, a reduction of $153.6 million of purchases of common stock in 2016, and the issuance of $200 million of senior notes in 2016.
on june 13, 2016, the company completed a private placement of $100 million aggregate principal amount of 3.20% senior notes due june 13, 2023 and $100 million aggregate principal amount of 3.37% senior notes due june 13, 2025 (collectively, the "notes") pursuant to a note purchase agreement, dated june 13, 2016 (the "purchase agreement"). each series of notes bears interest at the stated amount per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on each june 13th and december 13th. the notes are unsecured obligations of the company and rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the company's other unsecured, unsubordinated debt. the company may at any time prepay all, or any portion of the notes; provided that such portion is greater than 5% of the aggregate principal amount of notes then outstanding. in the event of a prepayment, the company will pay an amount equal to par plus accrued interest plus a make-whole amount. in addition, the company may repurchase the notes by making an offer to all holders of the notes, subject to certain conditions.
the company maintains a revolving credit facility (the "revolving facility"), which is a $700.0 million unsecured, multi-currency bank credit facility expiring on june 23, 2020. at december 31, 2016, there was $169.6 million outstanding under the revolving facility and $9.2 million of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in a net available borrowing capacity under the revolving facility at december 31, 2016 of $521.2 million. borrowings under the revolving facility bear interest, at either an alternate base rate or an adjusted libor rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin. this applicable margin is based on the company's senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating and can range from .005% to 1.50%. based on the company's credit rating at december 31, 2016, the applicable margin was 1.10%, resulting in a weighted average interest rate of 1.50% at december 31, 2016. interest is payable (a) in the case of base rate loans, quarterly, and (b) in the case of libor rate loans, on the maturity date of the borrowing, or quarterly from the effective date for borrowings exceeding three months. the company may request increases in the lending commitments under the credit agreement, but the aggregate lending commitments pursuant to such increases may not exceed $350.0 million. an annual revolving facility fee, also based on the company's credit rating, is currently 15 basis points and is payable quarterly.
on june 9, 2015, the company paid the balance of the 2.58% senior euro notes, upon its maturity, using cash on hand.
on december 9, 2011, the company completed a public offering of $350.0 million 4.2% senior notes due december 15, 2021 ("4.2% senior notes"). the net proceeds from the offering of $346.2 million, after deducting a $0.9 million issuance
23
discount, a $2.3 million underwriting commission and $0.6 million offering expenses, were used to repay $306.0 million of outstanding bank indebtedness, with the balance used for general corporate purposes. the 4.2% senior notes bear interest at a rate of 4.2% per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on each june 15 and december 15. the company may redeem all or part of the 4.2% senior notes at any time prior to maturity at the redemption prices set forth in the note indenture governing the 4.2% senior notes. the company may issue additional debt from time to time pursuant to the indenture. the indenture and 4.2% senior notes contain covenants that limit the company's ability to, among other things, incur certain liens securing indebtedness, engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions, and enter into certain consolidations, mergers, conveyances, transfers or leases of all or substantially all the company's assets. the terms of the 4.2% senior notes also require the company to make an offer to repurchase the 4.2% senior notes upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the indenture) at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
on december 6, 2010, the company completed a public offering of $300.0 million 4.5% senior notes due december 15, 2020 ("4.5% senior notes"). the net proceeds from the offering of $295.7 million, after deducting a $1.6 million issuance discount, a $1.9 million underwriting commission and $0.8 million offering expenses, were used to repay $250.0 million of outstanding bank indebtedness, with the balance used for general corporate purposes. the 4.5% senior notes bear interest at a rate of 4.5% per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on each june 15 and december 15. the company may redeem all or a portion of the 4.5% senior notes at any time prior to maturity at the redemption prices set forth in the note indenture governing the 4.5% senior notes. the company may issue additional debt from time to time pursuant to the indenture. the indenture and 4.5% senior notes contain covenants that limit the company's ability to, among other things, incur certain liens securing indebtedness, engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions, and enter into certain consolidations, mergers, conveyances, transfers or leases of all or substantially all the company's assets. the terms of the 4.5% senior notes also require the company to make an offer to repurchase the 4.5% senior notes upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the indenture) at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
there are two key financial covenants that the company is required to maintain in connection with the revolving facility and the notes, a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1 and a maximum leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1. at december 31, 2016, the company was in compliance with both of these financial covenants, as the company's interest coverage ratio was 11.51 to 1 and the leverage ratio was 1.91 to 1. there are no financial covenants relating to the 4.5% senior notes or 4.2% senior notes; however, both are subject to cross-default provisions.
on december 1, 2015 the company's board of directors approved an increase of $300.0 million in the authorized level for repurchases of common stock. repurchases under the program will be funded with future cash flow generation or borrowings available under the revolving facility. during 2016, the company purchased a total of 0.7 million shares at a cost of $55.0 million compared to 2.8 million shares purchased in 2015 at a cost of $210.5 million, of which $2.3 million was settled in january 2016. as of december 31, 2016, there was $580 million of repurchase authorization remaining.
the company believes current cash, cash from operations and cash available under the revolving facility will be sufficient to meet its operating cash requirements, planned capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on all borrowings, pension and postretirement funding requirements, authorized share repurchases and annual dividend payments to holders of the company's common stock for the next twelve months. additionally, in the event that suitable businesses are available for acquisition upon acceptable terms, the company may obtain all or a portion of the financing for these acquisitions through the incurrence of additional borrowings. as of december 31, 2016, $169.6 million was outstanding under the revolving facility, with $9.2 million of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in net available borrowing capacity under the revolving facility at december 31, 2016 of approximately $521.2 million.
contractual obligations our contractual obligations include pension and postretirement medical benefit plans, rental payments under operating leases, payments under capital leases, and other long-term obligations arising in the ordinary course of business. there are no identifiable events or uncertainties, including the lowering of our credit rating, which would accelerate payment or maturity of any of these commitments or obligations.
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december 31, 2016, and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. in addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings. additional detail regarding these obligations is provided in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."

critical accounting policies we believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. for a summary of all of our accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
revenue recognition - the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured. for product sales, delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer. revenue from services is recognized when the services are provided or ratably over the contract term. some arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables, including the combination of products and services. in such cases, the company has identified these as separate elements in accordance with asc 605-25, revenue recognition-multiple-element arrangements, and recognizes revenue consistent with the policy for each separate element based on the relative selling price method. revenues from certain long-term contracts are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method. percentage-of-completion is measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for such contract at completion. provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted long-term contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is reasonably possible that completion costs, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements, will be revised in the near-term. such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.
the company records allowances for discounts, product returns and customer incentives at the time of sale as a reduction of revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on historical experience and known trends. the company also offers product warranties and accrues its estimated exposure for warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the warranty period, warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the company.
goodwill, long-lived and intangible assets - the company evaluates the recoverability of certain noncurrent assets utilizing various estimation processes. an impairment of a long-lived asset exists when the asset's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through future operations. an impairment of an indefinite-lived intangible asset or goodwill exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. assessments of possible impairments of long-lived or indefinite-lived intangible assets or goodwill are made if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. additionally, testing for possible impairments of recorded indefinite-lived intangible asset balances and goodwill is performed annually. on october 31, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the company compares the fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists. the amount and timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows to determine the fair value of the related assets. in 2016 and 2015, the company concluded that certain long-lived assets had a fair value that was less than the carrying value of the assets, resulting in $0.2 million and $0.8 million, respectively, of long-lived asset impairment charges.
25
the company's business acquisitions result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the company will incur in future periods. the company follows the guidance prescribed in asc 350, goodwill and other intangible assets, to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing an income approach (discounted cash flows) weighted 50% and a market approach (consisting of a comparable public company multiples methodology) weighted 50%. to determine the reasonableness of the calculated fair values, the company reviews the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach yielded significantly different valuations.
the key assumptions are updated every year for each reporting unit for the income and market approaches used to determine fair value. various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results, annual operating plans, strategic plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, the weighted average cost of capital, market data and market multiples. the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the weighted average cost of capital, market multiples, forecasted ebitda, and terminal growth rates. the 2016 and 2015 ranges for these three assumptions utilized by the company are as follows:
assumptions                                 2016            2015
range           range weighted average cost of capital   9.0% to 12.0%   9.5% to 13.0%
market multiples                   9.5x to 17.5x   7.5x to 14.0x terminal growth rates               3.0% to 3.5%    3.0% to 3.5%
in assessing the fair value of the reporting units, the company considers both the market approach and the income approach. under the market approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by the respective trailing twelve month ebitda and the forward looking 2017 ebitda (generally 50% each), based on multiples of comparable public companies. the market approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including forecasted ebitda and selected market multiples. under the income approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. the income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of operating results, capital expenditures, net working capital requirements, long-term growth rates and discount rates. weighting was equally attributed to both the market and income approaches (50% each) in arriving at the fair value of the reporting units.
in addition to performing our annual impairment test, we also performed interim impairment tests due to the divestitures in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 as well as the reorganization of certain reporting units. as a result of these impairment tests, the company concluded that the reporting units had fair values in excess of their carrying values.
the banjo trade name is an indefinite-lived intangible asset which is tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with asc 350 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. the company uses the relief-from-royalty method, a form of the income approach. the relief-from-royalty method is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions, including estimates of revenues, royalty rates and discount rates.
the akron brass trade name is an indefinite-lived intangible asset that was acquired as a result of the akron brass acquisition in march 2016 and is tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with asc 350 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. the company uses the relief-from-royalty method, a form of the income approach. the relief-from-royalty method is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions, including estimates of revenues, royalty rates and discount rates.
in 2016 and 2015, there were no triggering events or changes in circumstances that would have required a review other than as of our annual test date. based on the results of our measurement as of october 31, 2016, the fair value of the banjo trade name was more than 25% in excess of the carrying value and the fair value of the akron brass trade name was near its carrying value as a result of the acquisition of this business in march 2016.
defined benefit retirement plans - the plan obligations and related assets of the defined benefit retirement plans are presented in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data." level 1 assets are valued using unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets. level 2 assets are valued using quoted prices or other observable inputs for similar assets. level 3 assets are valued using unobservable inputs, but reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets. plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by consulting with actuaries using a number of assumptions provided by the company. key assumptions in the determination of the annual pension expense include the discount rate, the rate of salary increases, and the estimated future return on plan assets. to the extent actual amounts differ from these assumptions and estimated amounts, results could be adversely affected.
26
the society of actuaries releases annual updates to mortality tables, which update life expectancy assumptions. idex adopts these annual updates and, in consideration of these tables, we modified the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension and post-retirement benefit obligations as of december 31, 2016, which will have a related impact on our annual benefit expense in future years. new mortality tables may result in additional funding requirements dependent upon the funded status of our plans. these expectations presume all other assumptions remain constant and there are no changes to applicable funding regulations.
changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the (gain) loss amortization and interest cost components of the projected benefit obligation ("pbo"), which in turn, may impact the company's funding decisions if the pbo exceeds plan assets. each 100 basis point increase in the discount rate will cause a corresponding decrease in the pbo of approximately $27 million based upon the december 31, 2016 data. each 100 basis point decrease in the discount rate will cause a corresponding increase in the pbo of approximately $33 million based upon the december 31, 2016 data.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
overview the following management's discussion and analysis ("md&a") is intended to assist in an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. this md&a is provided as a supplement to, should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report. except for the historical information contained herein, the discussions in this md&a contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. our future results could differ materially from those discussed herein. factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below in this md&a under "forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results."
the following is a list of the sections of this md&a, together with our perspective on their contents, which we hope will assist in reading these pages:
•   business considerations - a general description of our business; the value drivers of our business; fiscal 2016 results of operations and liquidity and capital resources key indicators; and industry-wide opportunities, challenges and risks that are relevant to us in the defense, government and commercial markets. in this section of this md&amp;a, "income from continuing operations" refers to income from continuing operations attributable to harris corporation common shareholders.
•   operations review - an analysis of our consolidated results of operations and of the results in each of our four business segments, to the extent the segment operating results are helpful to an understanding of our business as a whole, for the three years presented in our financial statements. in this section of this md&amp;a, "income from continuing operations" refers to income from continuing operations attributable to harris corporation common shareholders.
•   liquidity, capital resources and financial strategies - an analysis of cash flows, funding of pension plans, common stock repurchases, dividends, capital structure and resources, contractual obligations, off-balance sheet arrangements, commercial commitments, financial risk management, impact of foreign exchange and impact of inflation.
•   critical accounting policies and estimates - a discussion of accounting policies and estimates that require the most judgment and a discussion of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented by us and their potential impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
•   forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results - cautionary information about forward-looking statements and a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or our current expectations or projections.
business considerations general we generate revenue, income and cash flows by developing, manufacturing or providing, and selling advanced, technology-based solutions that solve government and commercial customers' mission-critical challenges. as of the end of fiscal 2016, we supported customers in more than 100 countries and had approximately 21,000 employees, including approximately 9,000 engineers and scientists. we generally sell directly to our customers, the largest of which are u.s. government customers and their prime contractors, and we utilize agents and intermediaries to sell and market some products and services, especially in international markets.
we structure our operations primarily around the products and services we sell and the markets we serve. we implemented a new organizational structure effective at the beginning of fiscal 2016, which resulted in changes to our operating segments, which are also our reportable segments and are referred to as business segments. as a result, for fiscal 2016, we reported the financial results of our continuing operations in the following four business segments:
•   communication systems, serving markets in tactical communications and defense and public safety networks;
•   space and intelligence systems, providing complete earth observation, environmental, geospatial, space protection, and intelligence solutions from advanced sensors and payloads, as well as ground processing and information analytics;
•   electronic systems, offering an extensive portfolio of solutions in electronic warfare, avionics, wireless technology, c4i and undersea systems; and
•   critical networks, providing managed services supporting air traffic management, energy and maritime communications, and ground network operation and sustainment, as well as high-value it and engineering services.
37
the historical results, discussion and presentation of our business segments as set forth in this report reflect the impact of these changes for all periods presented in order to present all segment information on a comparable basis. there is no impact on our previously reported consolidated statements of income, balance sheet or statements of cash flows resulting from these changes financial information with respect to all of our other activities, including corporate costs not allocated to our business segments or discontinued operations, is reported as part of the "engineering, selling and administrative expenses," "non-operating income (loss)," "interest income," "interest expense" or "discontinued operations, net of income taxes" line items in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
value drivers of our business in fiscal 2016, our ability to drive our business' performance in the near-term and position the company to create long-term value centered upon successfully integrating exelis to maximize the benefits of the transformative acquisition while continuing to focus on our core values of operational excellence and leading through innovation, both of which are embedded in everything we do at harris.
our strategic focus includes:
•capture exelis synergies;
•drive operational excellence;
•optimize our portfolio to focus where technology differentiates;
•grow our core franchises and extend into close adjacencies;
•invest in research and development ("r&d") to drive discriminating technology; and
•balance capital deployment.
our first priority is the successful integration of exelis and we are capturing synergy savings. as a result of our disciplined execution, our synergy savings are a full year ahead of our original plan. as our integration efforts focus on driving greater cost and operational efficiencies and capturing opportunities to drive revenue growth, we continue to execute against our strategic priorities and focus on maintaining our deep customer relationships, commercializing our technology and driving operational excellence.
our operational excellence program, harris business excellence ("hbx"), is focused on streamlining processes, optimizing program execution, and increasing customer satisfaction. hbx incorporates standardized, industry-proven processes and tools based on the principles of lean and six sigma. since implementation, we have made significant strides in customer satisfaction, productivity and asset velocity through our efforts to optimize processes, eliminate waste, reduce costs and enhance quality across our company, including in manufacturing, field operations, direct and indirect material sourcing and other supply chain areas, overhead functions and working capital initiatives. one method we use to drive continuous improvement is "value engineering" - continuously evaluating new materials, processes and technologies to insert into products already in production, helping to reduce costs and improve both quality and customer satisfaction.
an important part of our strategy to drive shareholder value is optimizing our business portfolio by focusing on investments in which technology provides differentiation. we dispassionately, objectively and aggressively assess which businesses strategically fit and are a better value to harris, as well as which businesses may be a better value on their own or with a third party. as part of this continuous portfolio shaping in order to best position harris to capture value, we completed the divestitures of hcs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and of aerostructures (part of our company as a result of our acquisition of exelis) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. we utilized proceeds from the aerostructures divestiture to pay down debt. going forward, we will continue to assess our portfolio with the goal of enhancing shareholder value creation.
after the integration of exelis, we now have greater scale, complementary technologies and breadth in capabilities that enable our core franchises to enhance and expand our offerings across the value chain. we form close partnerships with our expanded customer base to enable us to deliver the highest quality products and solutions to solve our customers' most complex challenges. we intend to grow our core franchises and capabilities by collaborating with our customers to address their evolving and growing needs through innovation.
innovation is at the core of our success, and r&d investment represents the foundation for innovation. our r&d investments are focused on leveraging our existing technology portfolio to introduce new solutions or expand customer-centric features and functions on existing solutions. innovation also leads to natural extensions of our core capabilities for capturing new opportunities in adjacent markets. innovation provides differentiation and is a key competitive advantage for our business.
in order to maximize efficiency while maintaining our technological edge, we have adopted a portfolio management approach to optimize investment in r&d at the company level rather than the business unit level and ensure our investment is cost-effective and supports innovation across the entire company. we introduced standardized processes and common metrics
38
to track progress and gauge success, and established core technology centers to more fully leverage r&d investment across our company.
during fiscal 2016, we succeeded in deleveraging our balance sheet with debt prepayments, retiring $650 million of debt, approximately one-third of our three-year debt reduction goal. we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in fiscal 2016, but with synergy savings ahead of schedule, we will rebalance our capital deployment by re-initiating share repurchases in fiscal 2017.
key indicators we believe our value drivers, when implemented, will improve our financial results, including: revenue; income from continuing operations and income from continuing operations per diluted common share; income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue; net cash provided by operating activities; return on invested capital; and return on average equity. the measure of our success is reflected in our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources key indicators as discussed below.
fiscal 2016 results of operations key indicators:    revenue, income from continuing operations, income from continuing operations per diluted common share and income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue represent key measurements of our value drivers:
•   revenue increased 47 percent to $7.5 billion in fiscal 2016 from $5.1 billion in fiscal 2015, benefiting from our acquisition of exelis;
•   income from continuing operations increased 3 percent to $345 million in fiscal 2016 from $334 million in fiscal 2015, primarily due to the inclusion in our operating results of exelis operations as a result of our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
•   income from continuing operations also reflected (i) a $367 million non-cash charge for impairment of goodwill and other assets related to harris caprock communications due to the downturn in the energy market and its impact on customer operations, (ii) $104 million for integration and other costs associated with our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, (iii) $11 million for amortization of a step-up in inventory, (iv) $48 million of charges primarily related to workforce reductions, facility consolidation and other items, (v) a net liability reduction of $101 million for certain post-employment benefit plans, and (vi) a $10 million net gain on the sale of aerostructures. income taxes on the above items were $49 million. income from continuing operations included an after-tax impact of $370 million or $2.95 per diluted common share from the above items.
•   income from continuing operations per diluted common share decreased 12 percent to $2.75 in fiscal 2016 from $3.11 in fiscal 2015, primarily due to the increase in the diluted common shares outstanding from shares issued in connection with our acquisition of exelis and recording in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 the non-cash impairment charge related to harris caprock communications as noted above; and
•   income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue decreased to 5 percent in fiscal 2016 from 7 percent in fiscal 2015, primarily due to recording in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 the non-cash impairment charge related to harris caprock communications as noted above.
refer to md&a heading "operations review" below in this report for more information.
liquidity and capital resources key indicators:     net cash provided by operating activities, return on invested capital, return on average equity and our consolidated total indebtedness to total capital ratio also represent key measurements of our value drivers:
•   net cash provided by operating activities increased to $924 million in fiscal 2016 from $854 million in fiscal 2015;
•   return on invested capital (defined as after-tax operating income from continuing operations divided by the two-point average of invested capital at the beginning and end of the fiscal year, where invested capital equals equity plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents) decreased to 6 percent in fiscal 2016 from 9 percent in fiscal 2015, primarily due to recording in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 the non-cash impairment charge related to harris caprock communications as noted above and an increase in the denominator from debt and equity issued in connection with our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015;
•   return on average equity (defined as income from continuing operations divided by the two-point average of equity at the beginning and end of the fiscal year) decreased to 11 percent in fiscal 2016 from 13 percent in fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher average equity from shares issued in connection with our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015;
•   our consolidated total indebtedness to total capital ratio at july 1, 2016 was 60 percent, compared to our 65 percent covenant limitation under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility; and
•   net cash used to repay borrowings decreased to $730 million in fiscal 2016 from fiscal 2015 when $954 million of net cash was used to repay borrowings including the redemption of two series of our notes.

industry-wide opportunities, challenges and risks department of defense and other u.s. federal markets:    u.s. government budgets remained constrained in fiscal 2016, and we anticipate a similarly constrained spending environment in fiscal 2017. in response to fiscal and economic challenges such as rising levels of debt, an economy with restrained growth, budget uncertainty and financial deficits, the u.s. government continues to focus on discretionary spending, entitlement programs and other fiscal and monetary policy initiatives to stimulate the economy, create jobs and reduce the deficit. in particular, the budget control act of 2011 ("bca") established limits on discretionary spending and reduced planned defense spending by $487 billion over a ten-year period which began with government fiscal year ("gfy") 2012 (u.s. government fiscal years begin october 1 and end september 30). in addition, the bca provided for additional automatic spending reductions, known as sequestration, that went into effect march 1, 2013, that would have resulted in an additional $500 billion reduction to planned defense spending over a nine-year period beginning with gfy 2013.
in november 2015, the president signed into law the bipartisan budget act of 2015 ("bba 2015"), which raised the limit on the u.s. government's debt through march 2017 and increased the sequester caps on discretionary spending imposed by the bca by $80 billion over gfy 2016 - 2017, providing more certainty in the near-term budget planning process. the cap on discretionary defense spending was increased by $25 billion for gfy 2016 and $15 billion for gfy 2017. in december 2015, the president signed into law the consolidated appropriations act of 2016, which funded the u.s. government through the end of september 2016. in addition, the president's budget proposal for gfy 2017 is consistent with bba 2015 funding which includes discretionary dod funding of approximately $521 million in gfy 2016 and $524 million in gfy 2017 as well as an approximate $59 billion for dod overseas contingency operations ("oco") spending in both gfy 2016 and gfy 2017. passing the 2-year, bba 2015 has provided more certainty in the budget planning process for both gfy 2016 and gfy 2017 and has given the dod flexibility in determining priorities.
budget caps for gfys 2018 through 2022, however, remain after the enactment of bba 2015 as well as the across-the-board spending reduction methodology as provided under the bca. absent any new legislation modifying the sequester caps, there remains uncertainty regarding how, or if, sequestration cuts will be applied in gfy 2018 through gfy 2022. dod and other agencies may have significantly less flexibility in determining priorities in these years. while recent budget actions, including an increase in dod gfy 2016 funding of approximately four percent from gfy 2015 levels, provide a more measured and strategic approach to addressing the u.s. government's fiscal challenges, we anticipate that the federal budget will continue to be the subject of considerable debate, which may have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and on our specific programs.
government oversight and risk:    as a u.s. government contractor, we are subject to u.s. government oversight. the u.s. government may investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations. depending on the results of those investigations and audits, the u.s. government could make claims against us. under u.s. government procurement regulations and practices, an indictment or conviction of a government contractor could result in that contractor being fined and/or suspended from being able to bid on, or from being awarded, new u.s. government contracts for a period of time. similar government oversight exists in most other countries where we conduct business.
for a discussion of risks relating to u.s. government contracts and subcontracts, see "item 1. business - principal customers; government contracts" and "item 1a. risk factors" of this report. we are also subject to other risks associated with u.s. government business, including technological uncertainties, dependence on annual appropriations and allotment of funds, extensive regulations and other risks, which are discussed in "item 1a. risk factors" and "item 3. legal proceedings" of this report.
state and local:    we also provide products to state and local government agencies that are committed to protecting our homeland and public safety. the public safety market was highly competitive and dependent on state and local government budgets during fiscal 2016. future market opportunities include upgrading aging analog infrastructure to new digital standards, as well as opportunities associated with next-generation lte solutions for high data-rate applications, an emerging market in the early stages of development.
international:   we believe there is continuing international demand from military and government customers for tactical radios, public safety communications, electronic warfare equipment, air traffic management, electronic attack and release systems, isr, as well as for turnkey managed satellite communications solutions for energy and maritime markets. we believe we can leverage our domain expertise and proven technology provided in the u.s. to further expand our international business.
we believe that our experience, technologies and capabilities are well aligned with the demand and requirements of the markets noted above in this report. however, we remain subject to the spending levels, pace and priorities of the u.s. government as well as international governments and commercial customers, and to general economic conditions that could
40
adversely affect us, our customers and our suppliers. we also remain subject to other risks associated with these markets, including technological uncertainties, adoption of our new products and other risks that are discussed below in this report under "forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results" and in "item 1a. risk factors" of this report.

revenue fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    the increase in revenue in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the inclusion in our operating results of revenue from a full year of exelis operations as a result of our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. revenue in fiscal 2016 also reflected weakness in our communication systems segment related to dod and international tactical radio markets and our critical networks segment, primarily in it services and harris caprock communications energy services due to the downturn in the energy market and its impact on customer operations.
fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014:    the increase in revenue in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily due to our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. revenue in fiscal 2015 also reflected weakness in our critical networks segment. the $106 million decrease in revenue in our critical networks segment was primarily due to lower revenue from u.s. government customers, primarily on the navy/marine corps intranet ("nmci") and u.s. air force network centric solutions programs.
see the "discussion of business segment results of operations" discussion below in this md&a for further information.
gross margin percentage fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue ("gross margin percentage") in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to a shift in the mix of contract types, toward an increased percentage of lower-margin cost-plus contracts. additionally, the decrease in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 reflected a lower gross margin percentage in exelis legacy tactical radio and night vision product lines and write-downs, recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, of certain assets related to restructuring programs.
fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014:    gross margin percentage in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was essentially unchanged as the decrease in gross margin percentage in our critical networks segment was offset by gross margin improvements in our other segments.
see the "discussion of business segment results of operations" discussion below in this md&a for further information.
engineering, selling and administrative expenses fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    the increase in engineering, selling and administrative ("esa") expenses in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the inclusion in our operating results of esa expenses from a full year of exelis operations as a result of our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, $132 million of amortization of intangible assets acquired, $104 million of integration and other costs associated with the acquisition, $11 million for amortization of a step up in inventory and $48 million of charges, recorded in fiscal 2016, for restructuring and other items. these drivers of the increase in esa expenses were partially offset by a net liability reduction of $101 million, recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, for certain post-employment benefit plans. the decrease in esa expenses as a percentage of revenue ("esa percentage") in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the net liability reduction for certain post-employment benefits described in the preceding sentence, lower esa percentage from exelis businesses and cost savings realized after our acquisition of exelis, partially offset by the amortization, integration and other costs and charges for restructuring noted in this paragraph.
overall company-sponsored research and development costs were $309 million in fiscal 2016 compared with $277 million in fiscal 2015.
fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014:    the increase in esa expenses and esa percentage in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily due to inclusion in our operating results of esa expenses from exelis operations as a result of our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and charges for integration, restructuring and other costs associated with our acquisition of exelis.
overall company-sponsored research and development costs were $277 million in fiscal 2015 compared with $264 million in fiscal 2014.
see the "discussion of business segment results of operations" discussion below in this md&a for further information.
non-operating income (loss)
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    non-operating income in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a $10 million net gain on the divestiture of aerostructures during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. non-operating loss in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to $118 million of charges associated with our optional redemption on may 27, 2015 of the entire outstanding $400 million principal amount of our 5.95% notes due december 1, 2017 and the entire outstanding $350 million principal amount of our 6.375% notes due june 15, 2019, including a total of $5 million of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts related to these notes that were written off in connection with our redemption of the notes. these charges were partially offset by a pre-tax gain of $9 million related to our divestiture of hcs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
42
fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014:    non-operating loss in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the same reasons as noted above for fiscal 2015 non-operating loss. non-operating income in fiscal 2014 was due to net income related to intellectual property matters.
see note 21: non-operating income (loss) in the notes for further information.
net interest expense fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    our net interest expense increased in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher average debt levels as a result of our issuance of $2.4 billion of debt securities and our borrowing of $1.3 billion under a term loan agreement to finance our acquisition of exelis in fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014:    our net interest expense increased in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily due to higher overall debt levels as a result of our issuance of $2.4 billion of debt securities and our borrowing of $1.3 billion under a term loan agreement to finance our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. net interest expense in fiscal 2015 also included $18 million of debt issuance costs related to financing commitments for a senior unsecured bridge loan facility in connection with our acquisition of exelis and $3 million of interest expense on debt securities issued by exelis that remained outstanding.
see note 18: interest expense in the notes for further information.
income taxes fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    in fiscal 2016, our effective tax rate (income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes) was negatively impacted by the non-deductibility for tax purposes of portions of the impairment charge described in note 8: goodwill in the notes. this negative impact was partially offset by the favorable impact of:
•   settlement of several items for amounts that were lower than previously recorded estimates;
•   legislation enacted in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 that restored the u.s. federal income tax credit for qualifying r&amp;d expenses for calendar year 2015 and made the credit permanent for the periods following december 31, 2015;
•   recognition of a tax loss, net of valuation allowances, upon the divestiture of aerostructures;
•   state tax reductions resulting from our integration of exelis operations; and
•   several differences between gaap and tax accounting related to investments.
in fiscal 2015, our effective tax rate benefited from foreign tax credits resulting from a dividend paid by a foreign subsidiary, finalizing issues with various foreign and domestic tax authorities for amounts lower than estimates previously recorded, additional deductions (primarily related to manufacturing) and additional research credits claimed on our fiscal 2014 tax return compared with our recorded estimates at the end of fiscal 2014. these benefits were partially offset in the fourth quarter by the tax cost of repatriating offshore funds, the impact of non-deductible goodwill on our divestiture of hcs and the non-deductibility of some acquisition-related costs.
fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014: the major discrete items from which our fiscal 2015 effective tax rate benefited are those noted for fiscal 2015 in the discussion above regarding fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015. in fiscal 2014, our effective tax rate benefited from additional deductions (primarily related to manufacturing) and additional research credits claimed on our fiscal 2013 tax return compared with our recorded estimates at the end of fiscal 2013, the settlement of a state tax audit and additional permanent deductions based on recent tax litigation unrelated to us.
see note 23: income taxes in the notes for further information.
discontinued operations, net of income taxes fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    discontinued operations in fiscal 2016 consisted of a $21 million after-tax increase in the loss on sale of broadcast communications from the final determination rendered in a dispute over the amount of the post-closing working capital adjustment to the purchase price and third-party costs related to the dispute. we did not have discontinued operations in fiscal 2015.
fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014:    we did not record any amounts in discontinued operations in fiscal 2015. discontinued operations in fiscal 2014 consisted of a $7 million after-tax increase in the loss on sale of broadcast communications from miscellaneous adjustments for contingencies related to the disposition, partially offset by a $2 million after-tax gain on sale of the remaining assets of cis.

income from continuing operations per diluted common share attributable to harris corporation common shareholders fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    the decrease in income from continuing operations per diluted common share in fiscal 2016 compared with the fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the same reasons noted in the discussions above in this md&a regarding fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 and by the increase in average common shares outstanding as a result of the issuance of shares in connection with the acquisition of exelis.
fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014:    the decrease in income from continuing operations per diluted common share in fiscal 2015 compared with the fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the same reasons noted in the discussions above in this md&a regarding fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 and by the increase in average common shares outstanding as a result of shares issued related to the acquisition of exelis.

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    the increase in segment revenue in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the inclusion in segment operating results of exelis operations (principally ground and airborne tactical radio and night vision operations) as a result of our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
segment revenue in fiscal 2016 also reflected weakness related to dod and international tactical radio markets. the decrease in segment gross margin percentage in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to a less favorable mix among products and programs, $14 million of restructuring and other charges and lower gross margin percentage in exelis legacy tactical radio and night vision product lines. segment esa percentage in fiscal 2016 was unchanged compared with fiscal 2015 primarily due to lower esa percentage from exelis businesses and cost savings realized after our acquisition of exelis, offset by $6 million of charges, recorded during fiscal 2016, for restructuring and other items. the decrease in segment operating income as a percentage of revenue ("operating margin percentage") in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 reflected the items discussed above regarding this segment.
the percentage of this segment's revenue that was derived from sales to u.s. government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the u.s. government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 52 percent in fiscal 2016.
fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014:    segment revenue in fiscal 2015 included tactical communications revenue of $1.315 billion, a 1 percent increase from $1.307 billion in fiscal 2014; and public safety and professional communications revenue of $460 million, a 12 percent decrease from $521 million in fiscal 2014. the increase in tactical communications revenue was primarily due to higher revenue in international markets, mostly offset by lower revenue from dod customers. the decrease in public safety and professional communications revenue was primarily due to continued market weakness.
the increase in segment gross margin percentage in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily due to a more favorable mix of segment revenue within the communication systems segment (a higher percentage of higher-margin tactical communications revenue compared with public safety and professional communications revenue) and retirement of risk on a large international program. the increase in segment esa percentage in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily

due to the impact of lower revenue. the decrease in segment operating income in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 reflected the items discussed above regarding this segment.

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    the increases in segment revenue, gross margin, esa expenses and operating income in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 were primarily due to the inclusion in segment operating results of exelis operations (principally geospatial intelligence solutions; integrated sensing and information systems; environmental intelligence; precision instruments and position, navigation and timing; and command, control and communication systems operations) as a result of our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
segment revenue also reflected higher revenue from new classified programs, including programs in space superiority and protection, partially offset by the completion of several other classified programs. the decrease in segment gross margin percentage in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was due to a less favorable mix of cost-plus intelligence and space payload programs, as well as the retirement of risk on certain space programs in fiscal 2015. the decrease in segment esa percentage in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to lower esa percentage from exelis businesses. the increase in segment operating margin percentage in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 reflected the items discussed above regarding this segment.
the percentage of this segment's revenue that was derived from sales to u.s. government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the u.s. government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 95 percent in fiscal 2016.
fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014:    the increases in segment revenue, gross margin, esa expenses and operating income in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 were primarily due to the inclusion in segment operating results of exelis operations as a result of our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
segment revenue also reflected higher revenue from the fgcm program, partially offset by lower revenue from the space network ground segment sustainment ("sgss") program for nasa and the noaa goes-r ground and antenna segment weather program. the increase in segment gross margin percentage in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily due to higher revenue, continued strong program performance and a more favorable mix of programs. the increase in segment esa expenses and esa percentage in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily driven by higher spending on research and development in fiscal 2015 and a favorable out-of-period adjustment related to our post-employment benefit plan in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, partially offset by the impact of higher revenue. the increases in segment operating income and operating margin percentage in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 reflected the items discussed above regarding this segment.

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014: the $106 million decrease in segment revenue in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily due to lower revenue from u.s. government customers (primarily on the nmci and u.s. air force network centric solutions programs), partially offset by the inclusion in segment operating results of exelis operations as a result of our acquisition of exelis in fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and higher revenue from the u.s. department of veteran affairs wi-fi program.
the decrease in segment gross margin percentage in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily due to lower revenue, including on the higher-margin nmci program, as well as a $7 million charge to cost of product sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 for telecommunications-related taxes, representing an out-of-period adjustment for taxes in the period fiscal 2011 through fiscal 2014. the segment esa percentage in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was essentially unchanged as a favorable out-of-period adjustment in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 related to our post-employment benefit plan was offset by lower general and administrative expenses from the collection of a previously reserved receivable in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, operational excellence improvements and the benefit of cost-reduction actions. the decreases in segment operating income and operating margin percentage in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 reflected the items discussed above regarding this segment.

* not meaningful fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015: the decrease in unallocated corporate expense in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to a net liability reduction of $101 million for certain post-employment benefit plans, a $14 million decrease in acquisition-related costs associated with the acquisition of exelis, including transaction, integration, restructuring and other costs, and cost savings realized after our acquisition of exelis. in connection with our acquisition of exelis, we identified approximately $1.6 billion of intangible assets. because the acquisition benefited our entire company as opposed to any individual segments, we recorded these intangible assets as corporate assets and the related amortization expense as unallocated corporate expense. amortization expense related to exelis intangibles was $132 million for fiscal 2016, compared with $11 million for fiscal 2015
fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014: the increase in unallocated corporate expense in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily due to $135 million of acquisition-related costs associated with the acquisition of exelis, including transaction, integration, restructuring and other costs.

cash and cash equivalents:    the $6 million increase in cash and cash equivalents from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to $924 million of net cash provided by operating activities, $181 million of net proceeds from the sale of businesses, $61 million of proceeds from borrowings and $44 million of proceeds from exercises of employee stock options, mostly offset by $730 million used to repay borrowings, $252 million used to pay cash dividends and $152 million used for net additions of property, plant and equipment. the $80 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to $3.186 billion used to acquire businesses, $198 million used to pay cash dividends, $150 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock, $148 million used for net additions of property, plant and equipment (including proceeds of $7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 related to the sale of our cyber integration center) and $55 million used for other financing activities, partially offset by $2.729 billion of net proceeds from borrowings, $854 million of net cash provided by operating activities, $47 million of proceeds from exercises of employee stock options and $43 million of net proceeds from our divestiture of hcs.
we ended fiscal 2016 with cash and cash equivalents of $487 million, and we have a senior unsecured $1 billion revolving credit facility that expires in july 2020 (all of which was available to us as of july 1, 2016). our $487 million of cash and cash equivalents at july 1, 2016 included $110 million held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $105 million is considered permanently reinvested. of the $105 million, $80 million was available for use in the u.s. without incurring additional u.s. income taxes. we would be required to recognize u.s. income taxes of $10 million on the remaining $25 million if we were to repatriate such funds to the u.s., but we have no current plans to repatriate such funds.

given our current cash position, outlook for funds generated from operations, credit ratings, available credit facility, cash needs and debt structure, we have not experienced to date, and do not expect to experience, any material issues with liquidity, although we can give no assurances concerning our future liquidity, particularly in light of our current level of debt, u.s. government budget uncertainties and the state of global commerce and financial uncertainty.
we also currently believe that existing cash, funds generated from operations, our credit facility and access to the public and private debt and equity markets will be sufficient to provide for our anticipated working capital requirements, capital expenditures, dividend payments, repayment of our term loans and pension contributions for the next 12 months and for the reasonably foreseeable future thereafter. our total capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 are expected to be approximately $175 million. we anticipate tax payments over the next three years to be approximately equal to our tax expense for the same period. for additional information regarding our income taxes, see note 23: income taxes in the notes. other than those cash outlays noted in the "contractual obligations" discussion below in this md&a, capital expenditures, dividend payments, payments under our term loans, repurchases of common stock and pension contributions, no other significant cash outlays are anticipated in fiscal 2017.
there can be no assurance, however, that our business will continue to generate cash flows at current levels or that the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program or our credit facility or in the debt markets will not be impacted by any potential future credit and capital markets disruptions. if we are unable to maintain cash balances or generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our obligations, we may be required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, reduce or eliminate strategic acquisitions, reduce or eliminate repurchases of common stock, reduce or eliminate dividends, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. our ability to make principal payments or pay interest on or refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance and financial results, which, to a certain extent, are subject to general conditions in or affecting the defense, government and integrated communications and information technology and services markets and to general economic, political, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors beyond our control.
net cash provided by operating activities:    our net cash provided by operating activities was consistently high in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, reflecting solid earnings and good working capital management. cash flow from operations was positive in all of our business segments in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014.
net cash used in investing activities:    the $3.3 billion decrease in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to $3.2 billion in net cash used to acquire exelis in fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. the $3.1 billion increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily due to $3.2 billion in net cash used to acquire exelis.
net cash provided by (used in) financing activities:    the $3.3 billion increase in net cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to $3.6 billion less proceeds from borrowings (primarily reflecting the debt issued in connection of our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015) and $54 million more net cash used to pay dividends, partially offset by: (i) $224 million less net cash used to repay borrowings (reflecting $730 million of net cash used to repay borrowings in fiscal 2016 compared with $954 million of net cash used to repay borrowings in fiscal 2015 including the redemption of two series of our notes), (ii) $150 million less net cash used to repurchase common stock, and (iii) $39 million less net cash used in other financing activities. net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2015 was $2.4 billion compared with $448 million of net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2014. this difference of approximately $2.8 billion is primarily due to $3.7 billion in proceeds from debt issued in connection with our acquisition of exelis, less approximately $0.9 billion of cash used to redeem our notes (as described above).
funding of pension plans funding requirements under applicable laws and regulations are a major consideration in making contributions to our u.s. pension plans. although we have significant discretion in making voluntary contributions, the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended by the pension protection act of 2006 and further amended by the worker, retiree, and employer recovery act of 2008, the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act ("map-21") and applicable internal revenue code regulations, mandate minimum funding thresholds. failure to satisfy the minimum funding thresholds could result in restrictions on our ability to amend the plan or make benefit payments. with respect to u.s. qualified pension plans, we intend to contribute annually not less than the required minimum funding thresholds.
the highway and transportation funding act of 2014 ("hatfa") and bba 2015, further extended the interest rate stabilization provision of map-21 until 2020. we currently anticipate making total contributions to our u.s. qualified pension plans in the range of $185 million to $195 million during fiscal 2017.
future required contributions will depend primarily on the actual annual return on assets and the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation at the end of each year. depending on these factors, and the resulting funded status of our pension plans, the level of future statutory minimum contributions could be material. we have net unfunded pension plan
49
obligations of approximately $2.2 billion as of july 1, 2016. see note 14: pension and other postretirement benefits in the notes for further information regarding our pension plans.
common stock repurchases during fiscal 2016, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under our 2013 repurchase program. during fiscal 2015, we used $150 million to repurchase 2,136,362 shares of our common stock under our 2013 repurchase program at an average price per share of $70.21, including commissions. in each of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, $16 million in shares of our common stock were delivered to us or withheld by us to satisfy withholding taxes on employee share-based awards. additionally, in fiscal 2015, we used $0.6 million to repurchase 8,000 shares of our common stock from our rabbi trust which is associated with our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. shares repurchased by us are cancelled and retired.
on august 23, 2013, our board of directors approved our $1 billion 2013 repurchase program, which was in addition to our prior share repurchase program approved in 2011 (our "2011 repurchase program"). our repurchases during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 used the remaining authorization under our 2011 repurchase program. as of july 1, 2016, we had a remaining, unused authorization of approximately $684 million under our 2013 repurchase program, which does not have a stated expiration date. the level of our repurchases depends on a number of factors, including our financial condition, capital requirements, cash flows, results of operations, future business prospects and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant. repurchases are expected to be funded with available cash and commercial paper and may be made through open market purchases, private transactions, transactions structured through investment banking institutions or any combination thereof. the timing, volume and nature of repurchases are subject to market conditions, applicable securities laws and other factors and are at our discretion and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. additional information regarding our repurchase programs is set forth above under "item 5. market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" of this report.
dividends on august 27, 2016, our board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend rate on our common stock from $.50 per share to $.53 per share, for an annualized cash dividend rate of $2.12 per share, which was our fifteenth consecutive annual increase in our quarterly cash dividend rate. our annualized cash dividend rate was $2.00 per share in fiscal 2016, $1.88 per share in fiscal 2015 and $1.68 per share in fiscal 2014. there can be no assurances that our annualized cash dividend rate will continue to increase. quarterly cash dividends are typically paid in march, june, september and december. we currently expect that cash dividends will continue to be paid in the near future, but we can give no assurances concerning payment of future dividends. the declaration of dividends and the amount thereof will depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition, capital requirements, cash flows, results of operations, future business prospects and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. additional information concerning our dividends is set forth above under "item 5. market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" of this report.
capital structure and resources
2015 credit agreement:    as discussed in note 11: credit arrangements in the notes, on july 1, 2015, we established a new $1 billion 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "2015 credit facility") by entering into a revolving credit agreement (the "2015 credit agreement") with a syndicate of lenders. the 2015 credit facility replaced our prior $1 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "2012 credit facility") established under the revolving credit agreement, dated as of september 28, 2012, as amended by amendment no. 1 thereto dated as of february 25, 2015 (as so amended, the "2012 credit agreement"), which was scheduled to terminate on september 28, 2017. the description of the 2015 credit facility and the 2015 credit agreement set forth in note 11: credit arrangements in the notes is incorporated herein by reference.
short-term debt:    our short-term debt at july 1, 2016 and july 3, 2015 was $15 million and $33 million, respectively, and consisted of local borrowing by international subsidiaries for working capital needs at july 1, 2016 and at july 3, 2015. we did not have borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program at july 1, 2016 or at july 3, 2015. our commercial paper program was supported at july 1, 2016 and july 3, 2015 by the 2015 credit facility.
long-term variable-rate debt:    the description of the term loan agreement set forth in note 13: long-term debt in the notes is incorporated herein by reference. as discussed in note 13: long-term debt in the notes, on may 29, 2015, in order to fund a portion of the cash consideration and other amounts payable in connection with our acquisition of exelis, we borrowed $1.3 billion under our term loan agreement, comprised of two tranches:
•   $650 million in a 3-year tranche due may 29, 2018 and
•   $650 million in a 5-year tranche due may 29, 2020.
long-term fixed-rate debt:    the description of our long-term fixed-rate debt set forth in note 13: long-term debt in the notes is incorporated herein by reference. as discussed in note 13: long-term debt in the notes, on may 27, 2015, we completed our optional redemption of the entire outstanding $400 million principal amount of our 5.95% notes due
50
december 1, 2017 at a "make-whole" redemption price of $448 million and the entire outstanding $350 million principal amount of our 6.375% notes due june 15, 2019 at a "make-whole" redemption price of $415 million. the notes were terminated and cancelled.
as discussed in note 13: long-term debt in the notes, on april 27, 2015, in order to fund a portion of the cash consideration and other amounts payable in connection with our acquisition of exelis, and to fund our optional redemption of our two series of notes described above, we issued debt securities in an aggregate principal amount of $2.4 billion, comprised of several tranches with principal amounts, interest rates and maturity dates as follows:
•   $500 million of 1.999% notes due april 27, 2018,
•   $400 million of 2.700% notes due april 27, 2020,
•   $600 million of 3.832% notes due april 27, 2025,
•   $400 million of 4.854% notes due april 27, 2035, and
•   $500 million of 5.054% notes due april 27, 2045.
common stock:    on may 29, 2015, in connection with our acquisition of exelis, we issued 19,270,836 new shares of our common stock as part of the merger consideration payable to exelis shareholders in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. for additional information, see "item 1. business - recent acquisitions and divestitures" of this report.
contractual obligations at july 1, 2016, we had contractual cash obligations to repay debt, to purchase goods and services and to make payments under operating leases. payments due under these long-term obligations are as follows:
obligations due by fiscal year total                 2017            2018and2019            2020and2021              after2021

(2) amounts do not include unrecognized tax benefits of $63 million.
(3) amounts do not include pension contributions and payments beyond fiscal 2017 because such amounts had not been determined.
off-balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the definition under sec rules, any of the following qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements:
•   any obligation under certain guarantee contracts;
•   a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets;
•   any obligation, including a contingent obligation, under certain derivative instruments; and
•   any obligation, including a contingent obligation, under a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the registrant, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the registrant.
currently we are not participating in any material transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including variable interest entities, and we do not have any material retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above. as of july 1, 2016, we did not have material financial guarantees or other contractual commitments that are reasonably likely to adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. in addition, we are not currently a party to any related party transactions that materially affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
we have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses and assets. in connection with these divestitures, we often provide representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as environmental liabilities and tax liabilities. we cannot estimate the potential liability from such representations, warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. we do not believe, however, that the liabilities relating to these representations, warranties and indemnities will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
51
due to our downsizing of certain operations pursuant to acquisitions, restructuring plans or otherwise, certain properties leased by us have been sublet to third parties. in the event any of these third parties vacates any of these premises, we would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. we believe that the financial risk of default by such sublessees is individually and in the aggregate not material to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
commercial commitments we have entered into commercial commitments in the normal course of business including surety bonds, standby letter of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions and customers primarily relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts to provide products and services to customers or to obtain insurance policies with our insurance carriers. at july 1, 2016, we had commercial commitments on outstanding surety bonds, standby letters of credit and other arrangements, as follows:
expiration of commitmentsby fiscal year total               2017                2018                2019             after 2019

the surety bonds and standby letters of credit used for performance are primarily related to public safety and professional communications. as is customary in bidding for and completing network infrastructure projects for public safety systems, contractors are required to procure surety bonds and/or standby letters of credit for bids, performance, warranty and other purposes (collectively, "performance bonds"). such performance bonds normally have maturities of up to three years and are standard in the industry as a way to provide customers a mechanism to seek redress if a contractor does not satisfy performance requirements under a contract. typically, a customer is permitted to draw on a performance bond if we do not fulfill all terms of a project contract. in such an event, we would be obligated to reimburse the financial institution that issued the performance bond for the amounts paid. it has been rare for our public safety and professional communications business to have a performance bond drawn upon. in addition, pursuant to the terms under which we procure performance bonds, if our credit ratings are lowered to below "investment grade," we may be required to provide collateral to support a portion of the outstanding amount of performance bonds. such a downgrade could increase the cost of the issuance of performance bonds and could make it more difficult to procure performance bonds, which would adversely impact our ability to compete for contract awards. such collateral requirements could also result in less liquidity for other operational needs or corporate purposes. in addition, any future disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in financial and insurance markets could also adversely affect our ability to obtain performance bonds and may result in higher funding costs.
financial risk management in the normal course of business, we are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks.
foreign exchange and currency:    we use foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge both balance sheet and off-balance sheet future foreign currency commitments. factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging programs for foreign currency include accuracy of sales estimates, volatility of currency (particularly with respect to the united kingdom due to brexit) markets and the cost and availability of hedging instruments. a 10 percent change in currency exchange rates for our foreign currency derivatives held at july 1, 2016 would not have had a material impact on the fair value of such instruments or our results of operations or cash flows. this quantification of exposure to the market risk associated with foreign currency financial instruments does not take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair value of our foreign denominated assets, liabilities and firm commitments. see note 20: derivative instruments and hedging activities in the notes for additional information.
52
interest rates:    as of july 1, 2016, we had long-term fixed-rate debt obligations. the fair value of these obligations is impacted by changes in interest rates; however, a 10 percent change in level of interest rates would not have had a material impact on the fair value of our long-term fixed-rate debt obligations at july 1, 2016. additionally, there is no interest rate risk associated with these obligations on our results of operations and cash flows, because the interest rates are fixed, and because our long-term fixed-rate debt is not putable (required to be redeemed by the issuer of the debt prior to maturity).
as of july 1, 2016, we also had long-term variable-rate debt obligations of $618 million, resulting from borrowing under our senior unsecured term loan facility in connection with our acquisition of exelis, comprised of term loans of $300 million in a 3-year tranche and $318 million in a 5-year tranche. these term loans bear interest that is variable based on certain short-term indices, thus exposing us to interest-rate risk. for each tranche of term loans, we are required to make quarterly principal amortization payments equal to 2.50 percent of the $650 million initial principal amount of such tranche of the term loans. we have the ability at any time or from time to time, to voluntarily prepay term loans of either tranche in whole or in part without premium or penalty. we made $269 million and $251 million of voluntary repayments of principal on the 3-year tranche of our term loans and the 5-year tranche of our term loans, respectively, during fiscal 2016. see note 13: long-term debt in the notes for further information.
from time to time, we also may have short-term variable-rate debt outstanding, primarily under our commercial paper program, subject to interest rate risk, although we did not have any short-term variable-rate debt outstanding as of july 1, 2016. we utilize our commercial paper program to satisfy short-term cash requirements, including bridge financing for strategic acquisitions until longer-term financing arrangements are put in place, temporarily funding repurchases under our share repurchase programs and temporarily funding redemption of long-term debt. the interest rate risk associated with such debt on our results of operations and cash flows is not material due to its temporary nature.
we can give no assurances, however, that interest rates will not change significantly or have a material effect on the fair value of our long-term fixed-rate debt obligations or on our results of operations or cash flows over the next twelve months.
impact of foreign exchange approximately 26 percent of our international business was transacted in local currency environments in fiscal 2016 compared with 27 percent in fiscal 2015. the impact of translating the assets and liabilities of these operations to u.s. dollars is included as a component of shareholders' equity. as of july 1, 2016, the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment included in shareholders' equity was a $131 million loss compared with a $62 million loss at july 3, 2015. we utilize foreign currency hedging instruments to minimize the currency risk of international transactions. gains and losses resulting from currency rate fluctuations did not have a material effect on our results in fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014.
impact of inflation to the extent feasible, we have consistently followed the practice of adjusting our prices to reflect the impact of inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for employees and the cost of purchased materials and services. inflation and changing prices did not materially adversely impact our gross margin, revenue or operating income in fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014.
critical accounting policies and estimates the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies or estimates. our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1: significant accounting policies in the notes. in preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances, we apply our accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in the notes. we consider the policies and estimates discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment, with financial reporting results dependent on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. specific risks for these critical accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs. the impact and any associated risks related to these estimates on our business operations are discussed throughout this md&a where such estimates affect our reported and expected financial results. senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and the related disclosure included herein with the audit committee of our board of directors. preparation of this report requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. actual results may differ from those estimates.
besides estimates that meet the "critical" accounting estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. all estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, including for estimates that we do not deem "critical."

revenue recognition a significant portion of our business is derived from development and production contracts. revenue and profits related to development and production contracts are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method, generally based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion (i.e., the "cost-to-cost" method) or the ratio of actual units delivered to estimated total units to be delivered under the contract (i.e., the "units-of-delivery" method) with consideration given for risk of performance and estimated profit. the majority of the revenue in our space and intelligence systems and electronic systems segments (and to a certain extent, revenue in our critical networks and communication systems segments) relates to development and production contracts, and the percentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition is primarily used for these contracts. change orders, claims or other items that may change the scope of a development and production contract are included in contract value only when the value can be reliably estimated and realization is probable. possible incentives or penalties and award fees applicable to performance on development and production contracts are considered in estimating contract value and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance. incentive provisions that increase earnings based solely on a single significant event generally are not recognized until the event occurs. we are party to certain contracts with incentive provisions or award fees that are subject to uncertainty until the conclusion of the contract and our customer may be entitled to reclaim and receive previous award fee payments.
under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, a single estimated total profit margin is used to recognize profit for each development and production contract over its period of performance. recognition of profit on development and production fixed-price contracts requires estimates of the total cost at completion and the measurement of progress toward completion. the estimated profit or loss on a development and production contract is equal to the difference between the estimated contract value and the estimated total cost at completion. due to the long-term nature of many of our programs, developing the estimated total cost at completion often requires judgment. factors that must be considered in estimating the cost of the work to be completed include the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, subcontractor performance, the risk and impact of delayed performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer and the recoverability of any claims outside the original development and production contract included in the estimate to complete. at the outset of each contract, we gauge its complexity and perceived risks and establish an estimated total cost at completion in line with these expectations. after establishing the estimated total cost at completion, we follow a standard estimate at completion process in which management reviews the progress and performance on our ongoing development and production contracts at least quarterly and, in many cases, more frequently. if we successfully retire risks associated with the technical, schedule and cost aspects of a contract, we may lower our estimated total cost at completion commensurate with the retirement of these risks. conversely, if we are not successful in retiring these risks, we may increase our estimated total cost at completion. additionally, at the outset of a cost-reimbursable contract (for example, contracts containing award or incentive fees), we establish an estimate of total contract value, or revenue, based on our expectation of performance on the contract. as the cost-reimbursable contract progresses, our estimates of total contract value may increase or decrease if, for example, we receive higher or lower than expected award fees. when adjustments in estimated total costs at completion or in estimated total contract value are determined, the related impact to operating income is recognized using the cumulative catch-up method, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of such adjustments for all prior periods. anticipated losses on development and production contracts or programs in progress are charged to operating income when identified. we have not made any material changes in the methodologies used to recognize revenue on development and production contracts or to estimate our costs related to development and production contracts in the past three fiscal years.
estimate at completion adjustments had the following impacts to operating income for the periods presented:
2016                                             2015              2014
(in millions)
favorable adjustments                 $199              $119             $91
unfavorable adjustments               (132   )           (62   )         (38   )
net operating income adjustments       $67               $57             $53
there were no individual impacts to operating income due to estimate at completion adjustments in fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014 that were material to our results of operations on a consolidated or segment basis for such periods.
we also recognize revenue from arrangements requiring the delivery or performance of multiple deliverables or elements under a bundled sale. in these arrangements, judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and the timing of revenue recognition for each deliverable. if we determine that individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting, we recognize the revenue associated with each unit of accounting separately, and contract revenue is allocated among the separate units of accounting at the inception of the arrangement based on relative selling price. if options or change orders materially change the scope of work or price of the contract subsequent to inception, we reevaluate and adjust our prior conclusions regarding units of accounting and allocation of contract revenue as necessary. the allocation of selling price among the separate
54
units of accounting may impact the timing of revenue recognition, but will not change the total revenue recognized on the arrangement. we establish the selling price used for each deliverable based on the vendor-specific objective evidence ("vsoe") of selling price, or third-party evidence ("tpe") of selling price if vsoe of selling price is not available, or best estimate of selling price ("besp") if neither vsoe of selling price nor tpe of selling price is available. in determining vsoe of selling price, a substantial majority of the recent standalone sales of the deliverable must be priced within a relatively narrow range. in determining tpe of selling price, we evaluate competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. generally, comparable pricing of our products to those of our competitors with similar functionality cannot be obtained. in determining besp, we consider both market data and entity-specific factors, including market conditions, the geographies in which our products are sold, our competitive position and strategy, and our profit objectives.
postretirement benefit plans former exelis employees participate in numerous defined benefit pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans (collectively, referred to as "defined benefit plans") in the united states, which are sponsored by harris. the determination of projected benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to defined benefit pension plans are dependent on various assumptions. these major assumptions primarily relate to discount rates, long-term expected rates of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, mortality, termination and other factors (some of which are disclosed in note 14: pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the notes). actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and are generally amortized over the estimated future life or service period of the plan participants. in fiscal 2015, we adopted updated mortality tables, which resulted in an increase in the defined benefit plans' projected benefit obligation beginning july 3, 2015 and estimated net periodic benefit cost beginning fiscal 2016.
significant assumptions management develops assumptions using relevant experience, in conjunction with market-related data for each plan. assumptions are reviewed annually with third party consultants and adjusted as appropriate. the table included below provides the weighted average assumptions used to estimate projected benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost as they pertain to our defined benefit pension plans.
obligation assumptions as of:          july 1, 2016        july 3, 2015
discount rate                                 3.62%               4.06%
rate of future compensation increase          2.75%               2.76%
cost assumptions for fiscal years:             2016   2015
discount rate                                 4.06%               3.77%
expected return on plan assets                7.91%               7.93%
rate of future compensation increase          2.76%               2.76%
key assumptions for the u.s. salaried retirement plan ("u.s. srp") (our largest defined benefit plan with approximately 91% of the total projected benefit obligation) included a discount rate for obligation assumptions of 3.63% and expected return on plan assets of 8.00% for fiscal 2016, which is being reduced to 7.75% for fiscal 2017. effective december 31, 2016, future benefit accruals under the u.s. srp will be frozen.
expected return on plan assets substantially all of our plan assets are managed on a commingled basis in a master investment trust. we determine our expected return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and estimates of future returns. specifically, we consider the plan's actual historical annual return on assets over the past 15, 20 and 25 years and historical broad market returns over long-term time frames based on our strategic allocation, which is detailed in note 14: pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the notes. future returns are based on independent estimates of long-term asset class returns. based on this approach, the long-term annual rate of return on assets was estimated at 7.91% and 7.93% for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. in fiscal 2017, we are reducing our estimate of the long-term annual return on assets to 7.75% for the u.s. srp as noted above and all other u.s. plans.
discount rate the discount rate is used to calculate the present value of expected future benefit payments at the measurement date. a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and generally decreases pension expense. the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of high-quality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period. the pension discount rate is determined by considering an interest rate yield curve comprising aaa/
55
aa bonds, with maturities between zero and thirty years, developed by the plan's actuaries. annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield curve to develop a single discount rate matching the plan's characteristics.
for fiscal 2017, we will be changing the approach used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost of the u.s. defined benefit plans. the new estimation approach discounts the individual expected cash flows underlying the service cost and interest cost using the applicable spot rates derived from the yield curve used to discount the cash flows used to measure the benefit obligation. historically, we estimated these service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period.
we are making this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates. we have accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate and accordingly have accounted for it prospectively. although the benefit obligation measured under this approach is unchanged, the more granular application of the spot rates is expected to reduce the fiscal 2017 service and interest costs for the u.s. defined benefit plans by approximately $46 million as a result of this change.
in tandem with our change to the alternative spot rate approach to estimate service cost and interest cost for fiscal 2017 expense, we changed, as of july 1, 2016, the underlying yield curve from a published median yield curve to our actuaries' above median yield curve to improve our ability to make such estimates. we believe we will be better able to explain changes of individual spot rates between periods with details from our actuaries supporting the underlying yield curve. if we had continued to use a median yield curve, our projected benefit obligation would have been approximately $339 million, or 5 percent higher as of july 1, 2016.
sensitivity analysis pension expense a 25 basis point change in the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate would have the following effect on the combined u.s. defined benefit pension plans' fiscal 2017 pension expense:
increase/(decrease)in pension expense
25 basispoint increase                     25 basispoint decrease
(in millions)
long-term rate of return on assets used to determine net periodic benefit cost   $(10.9              )                             $10.9
discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost                        6.6                                                (7.9         )
projected benefit obligation funded status is derived by subtracting the respective year-end values of the projected benefit obligations ("pbo") from the fair value of plan assets. the sensitivity of the pbo to changes in the discount rate varies depending on the magnitude and direction of the change in the discount rate. we estimate that a decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate of the combined u.s. defined benefit pension plans would increase the pbo by approximately $182 million and an increase of 25 basis points would decrease the pbo by approximately $173 million.
fair value of plan assets the plan assets of our defined benefit plans comprise a broad range of investments, including domestic and international equity securities, fixed income investments, interests in private equity and hedge funds and cash and cash equivalents.
a significant portion of our defined benefit plans asset portfolio is comprised of investments in private equity and hedge funds. the private equity and hedge fund investments are generally measured using the valuation of the underlying investments or at net asset value. however, in certain instances, the values reported by the asset managers were not current at the measurement date. consequently, management has estimated adjustments to the last reported value where necessary to measure the assets at fair value at the measurement date. these adjustments consider information received from the asset managers, as well as general market information. asset values for other positions were generally measured using market observable prices. see note 14: pension and other postretirement benefits in the notes for further information.
provisions for excess and obsolete inventory losses we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market. we balance the need to maintain prudent inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance with the risk of excess or obsolete inventory due to changing technology and customer requirements. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory primarily based on our estimated forecast of product demand, anticipated end of product life and production requirements. the review of excess and obsolete inventory applies to all of our business segments. several factors may influence the sale and use
56
of our inventories, including our decision to exit a product line, technological change and new product development. these factors could result in a change in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand. additionally, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. in the future, if we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we would be required to recognize such costs in the "cost of product sales" line item in our consolidated statement of income at the time of such determination. in the case of goods which have been written down below cost, such reduced amount is to be considered the cost for subsequent accounting purposes. we have not made any material changes in the reserve methodology used to establish our inventory loss reserves during the past three fiscal years.
as of july 1, 2016, our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $54 million, or 11 percent of our gross inventory balance, which compares with our reserve of $83 million, or 13 percent of our gross inventory balance, as of july 3, 2015. we recorded $30 million, $7 million and $5 million in inventory write-downs that either reduced our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory or our income from continuing operations before income taxes during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. although we make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, including the impact of planned future product launches, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results.
goodwill goodwill in our consolidated balance sheet as of july 1, 2016 and july 3, 2015 was $5,975 million and $6,348 million, respectively. goodwill is not amortized. we perform annual (or under certain circumstances, more frequent) impairment tests of our goodwill using a two-step process. the first step is to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units with its net book value, including goodwill, adjusted for allocations of corporate assets and liabilities as appropriate. if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its adjusted net book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. if the adjusted net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit.
harris caprock communications impairment indications of potential impairment of goodwill related to harris caprock communications (which is part of our critical networks segment) were present as of the quarter ended january 1, 2016 due to the downturn in the energy market and its impact on customer operations, which also resulted in a decrease in the fiscal 2016 outlook for harris caprock communications. consequently, we performed an interim test of harris caprock communications' goodwill for impairment as of january 1, 2016.
to test for potential impairment of goodwill related to harris caprock communications, we prepared an estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit based on projected discounted cash flows. the current carrying value of the harris caprock communications reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value, and accordingly, we allocated the estimated fair value to the assets and liabilities of the harris caprock communications reporting unit to estimate the implied fair value of goodwill.
in conjunction with the above-described impairment test, we also conducted a test for impairment of other assets related to harris caprock communications, including amortizable intangible assets and fixed assets, and impairment of these assets was considered prior to the conclusion of the goodwill impairment test. the estimated fair value of these other assets related to harris caprock communications was determined based, in part, on an analysis of projected cash flows.
as a result of these impairment tests, we concluded that goodwill and other assets related to harris caprock communications were impaired as of january 1, 2016, and we recorded an estimated non-cash impairment charge of $367 million, of which $290 million related to goodwill, in the quarter ended january 1, 2016. most of the $367 million impairment charge is not deductible for tax purposes. see note 23: income taxes in the notes for the tax impact related to this impairment charge.
the impairment does not cause us to be in noncompliance with the covenants under our credit arrangements, and we do not expect the impairment to impact our ongoing financial performance, although no assurances can be given.
57
fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016 impairment tests we estimate fair values of our reporting units based on projected cash flows, and sales and/or earnings multiples applied to the latest twelve months' sales and earnings of our reporting units. projected cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales, operating costs and balance sheet metrics reflecting our view of the financial and market conditions of the underlying business; and the resulting cash flows are discounted using an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk in the forecasted cash flows. the sales and earnings multiples applied to the sales and earnings of our reporting units are based on current multiples of sales and earnings for similar businesses, and based on sales and earnings multiples paid for recent acquisitions of similar businesses made in the marketplace. we then assess whether any implied control premium, based on a comparison of fair value based purely on our stock price and outstanding shares with fair value determined by using all of the above-described models, is reasonable. we have not made any material changes during the past three fiscal years in the methodology used in the assessment of whether or not goodwill is impaired.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016, we performed our annual impairment tests of our reporting units' goodwill. we completed these tests with no adjustment required to the goodwill of any of our reporting units. as of the date of our fiscal 2016 impairment test, the estimated fair values for each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values. however, the fair value of two of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values by between 10 and 15 percent. both reporting units include a significant concentration of businesses that were recently acquired as part of the exelis acquisition in may 2015 and were recorded at their fair value at that time. although no impairment exists for these reporting units, an impairment of goodwill could result from a number of circumstances, including different assumptions used in determining the fair value of the reporting units; future deterioration of the businesses, including further weakness in it services in our critical networks segment; or a sharp increase in interest rates without a corresponding increase in future revenue.
income taxes and tax valuation allowances we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheet, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide necessary valuation allowances as required. future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the tax law. we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. we have not made any material changes in the methodologies used to determine our tax valuation allowances during the past three fiscal years.
our consolidated balance sheet as of july 1, 2016 included deferred tax assets of $598 million and deferred tax liabilities of $9 million. this compares with deferred tax assets of $502 million and deferred tax liabilities of $12 million as of july 3, 2015. for all jurisdictions for which we have net deferred tax assets, we expect that our existing levels of pre-tax earnings are sufficient to generate the amount of future taxable income needed to realize these tax assets. our valuation allowance related to deferred income taxes, which is reflected in our consolidated balance sheet, was $300 million as of july 1, 2016 and $72 million as of july 3, 2015. the increase in valuation allowance was primarily due to a capital loss incurred for tax purposes when we completed the divestiture of aerostructures. portions of this capital loss will produce tax benefits either through carry-back to capital gains recognized on preceding years' filed returns or through netting with future capital gains from known sources based on current balance sheet valuations. we recorded a valuation allowance in fiscal 2016 to reflect the excess of the capital loss over these known sources of capital gains. although we make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of our deferred tax assets, if we continue to operate at a loss in certain jurisdictions or are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income, or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, or if the potential impact of tax planning strategies changes, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our operating results.
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements accounting pronouncements that have recently been issued but have not yet been implemented by us are described in note 2: accounting changes or recent accounting pronouncements in the notes, which describes the potential impact that these pronouncements are expected to have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

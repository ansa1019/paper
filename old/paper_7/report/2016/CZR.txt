("eri" or the "company"), a nevada corporation, was formed in september 2013 to be the parent company following the merger of wholly-owned subsidiaries of the company into eldorado holdco llc ("holdco"), a nevada limited liability company formed in 2009 that is the parent company of eldorado resorts llc ("resorts"), and mtr gaming group, inc. ("mtr gaming"), a delaware corporation incorporated in 1988 (the "mtr merger"). effective upon the consummation of the merger on september 19, 2014 (the "mtr merger date"), mtr gaming and holdco each became a wholly-owned subsidiary of eri and, as a result of such transactions, resorts became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of eri.
resorts owns and operates the eldorado resort casino reno, a premier hotel, casino and entertainment facility centrally located in downtown reno, nevada ("eldorado reno"), which opened for business in 1973. resorts also owns eldorado resort casino shreveport ("eldorado shreveport"), a 403‐room all suite art deco‐style hotel and a tri‐level riverboat dockside casino complex situated on the red river in shreveport, louisiana, which commenced operations under its previous owners in december 2000.
prior to november 24, 2015 (the "reno acquisition date"), resorts owned a 48.1% interest in the joint venture (the "silver legacy joint venture") which owns the silver legacy resort casino ("silver legacy"), a major themed hotel and casino situated between and seamlessly connected at the mezzanine level to the eldorado reno and circus reno, (collectively, the "reno tri-properties"), a hotel and casino previously owned and operated by galleon, inc., an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of mgm resorts international.
on the reno acquisition date, resorts consummated the acquisition of all of the assets and properties of circus circus reno ("circus reno") and the 50% membership interest in the silver legacy joint venture owned by galleon, inc. (collectively, the "circus reno/silver legacy purchase" or the "reno acquisition") pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement, dated as of july 7, 2015 (the "purchase agreement"), entered into by certain of our subsidiaries with circus circus casinos, inc. and galleon, inc., each an affiliate of mgm resorts international, with respect to the acquisition. on the reno acquisition date, resorts also exercised its right to acquire the 3.8% interest in eldorado limited liability company ("ellc") held by certain affiliates and stockholders of the company. as a result of these transactions, ellc and cc-reno, llc, a newly formed nevada limited liability company, became wholly-owned subsidiaries of eri, and silver legacy became an indirect wholly‐owned subsidiary of eri.
resorts previously owned a 21.3% interest in tamarack crossing, llc ("tamarack"), a nevada limited liability company that owned and operated tamarack junction, a casino in south reno which commenced operations on september 4, 2001. on september 1, 2014, and as a condition to closing the mtr merger, resorts distributed to holdco, and holdco subsequently distributed to its members on a pro rata basis resorts' interest in tamarack. no gain or loss was recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as a result of such distribution because the distribution was in the amount of the book value of tamarack and totaled $5.5 million.
mtr gaming operates as a hospitality and gaming company with racetrack, gaming and hotel properties in west virginia, pennsylvania and ohio. mtr gaming, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, owns and operates mountaineer casino, racetrack & resort in chester, west virginia ("mountaineer"), presque isle downs & casino in erie, pennsylvania ("presque isle downs"), and eldorado gaming scioto downs ("scioto downs") in columbus, ohio. scioto downs, through its subsidiary, racelinebet, inc., also operates racelinebet.com, a national account wagering service that offers online and telephone wagering on horse races as a marketing affiliate of twinspires.com, an affiliate of churchill downs, inc.

32
the mtr merger closed on the mtr merger date and has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition of mtr gaming by holdco under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("us gaap"). as a result, holdco is considered the acquirer of mtr gaming for accounting purposes. the financial information included in this item 7 for periods prior to the mtr merger date are those of holdco and its subsidiaries. the presentation of information herein for periods prior to the mtr merger date and the reno acquisition date and after the mtr merger date and reno acquisition date, respectively, are not fully comparable because the results of operations for mtr gaming and circus reno are not included for periods prior to the mtr merger date or reno acquisition date, respectively, and the results of operations of the silver legacy joint venture were not consolidated prior to the reno acquisition date. summary financial results of mtr gaming for the year ended december 31, 2014 is included in mtr gaming's annual report on form 10‐k as filed with the securities and exchange commission ("sec").
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is intended to provide information to assist in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. our historical operating results may not be indicative of our future results of operations because of these factors and the changing competitive landscape in each of our markets, as well as by factors discussed elsewhere herein. we recommend that you read this md&a in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included in this annual report.
reportable segments the company has aggregated its operating segments into three reportable segments: eldorado reno, silver legacy and circus reno as nevada, eldorado shreveport as louisiana, and scioto downs, presque isle downs and mountaineer as eastern.
key performance metrics our primary source of revenue is generated by our gaming operations, but we use our hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment, retail shops, racing and other services to attract customers to our properties. our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers visiting and staying at our properties. key performance metrics include volume indicators such as table games drop and slot handle, which refer to amounts wagered by our customers. the amount of volume we retain, which is not fully controllable by us, is recognized as casino revenues and is referred to as our win or hold. in addition, hotel occupancy and price per room designated by average daily rate ("adr") are key indicators for our hotel business. our calculation of adr consists of the average price of occupied rooms per day including the impact of resort fees and complimentary rooms. complimentary room rates are determined based on an analysis of retail or cash rates for each customer segment and each type of room product to estimate complimentary rates which are consistent with retail rates. complimentary rates are reviewed at least annually and on an interim basis if there are significant changes in market conditions. complimentary rooms are treated as occupied rooms in our calculation of hotel occupancy.
significant factors impacting financial results the following summary highlights the significant factors impacting our financial results during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
•   isle of capri acquisition - on september 19, 2016, the company and isle of capri casinos, inc., a delaware corporation ("isle" or "isle of capri") entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "merger agreement"), whereby the company will acquire all of the outstanding shares of isle of capri for $23.00 in cash or 1.638 shares of company common stock, at the election of each isle stockholder (the "isle acquisition"). elections are subject to proration and reallocation such that the outstanding shares of isle common stock will be exchanged for aggregated consideration comprised of 58% cash and 42% eldorado common stock. the consummation of the merger is subject to receipt of approval of applicable gaming authorities and other customary closing conditions, and is expected to be consummated in the second quarter of 2017. the waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino act ("hsr act") terminated on october 21, 2016. the company and isle received approval from each of their respective stockholders at separate special meetings on january 25, 2017. eldorado has received committed financing for the transaction totaling $2.1 billion. acquisition charges totaling $8.5 million, attributed to the isle acquisition, are reported on the accompanying statement of operations related to legal, accounting, financial advisory services and other costs during the year ended december 31, 2016.

33
upon completion of the isle acquisition, the company will add 12 additional properties to its portfolio after giving effect to the planned dispositions of isle of capri casino hotel lake charles and lady luck casino marquette. on august 22, 2016, isle entered into an agreement to sell isle of capri casino hotel lake charles for aggregate consideration of $134.5 million, subject to certain adjustments. on october 13, 2016, isle entered into an agreement to sell lady luck casino marquette for cash consideration of approximately $40.0 million, subject to certain adjustments.
•   circus reno/silver legacy purchase - pursuant to the purchase agreement in november 2015, eri paid $80.2 million in cash, comprised of the $72.5 million purchase price plus $7.7 million in estimated working capital adjustments and the assumption of the amounts outstanding under silver legacy's senior secured term loan facility. an additional $0.5 million was paid subsequent to the reno acquisition date representing the final working capital adjustment. eri funded the purchase price for the reno acquisition and repaid the borrowings outstanding under the silver legacy credit facility using a portion of the proceeds from the sale of its senior notes, borrowings under its revolving credit facility and cash on hand. information presented prior to the reno acquisition date does not reflect the results of operations for circus reno, and only includes our interest in the silver legacy joint venture prior to the reno acquisition as an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate. as a result, incremental increases in revenues and expenses attributable to the addition of circus reno and silver legacy are reflected in our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2015. in conjunction with the reno acquisition, we recorded a $35.6 million gain related to the valuation of our pre-acquisition investment in the silver legacy joint venture and incurred acquisition costs totaling $2.5 million in 2015. we incurred an additional $0.6 million in acquisition charges in 2016. in 2015, we also expensed fees totaling $0.6 million, which are included in corporate costs, related to our equity offering initially intended to fund the reno acquisition. these fees were expensed as a result of our election to fund the final component of the reno acquisition with existing revolver capacity in lieu of an equity offering.

•   mtr gaming merger - the mtr merger has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition of mtr gaming by holdco under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. our results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 reflect incremental increases in revenues and expenses attributable to the addition of the mtr gaming properties. additionally, we incurred acquisition costs associated with the mtr merger totaling $0.1 million and $7.4 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

•   execution of cost savings program - starting in the second quarter of 2015, we identified several areas to improve property level and consolidated margins through operating and cost efficiencies and exercising financial discipline throughout the company without impacting the player experience. in addition to cost savings relating to duplicative executive compensation, legal and accounting fees and other corporate expenses that have been eliminated as a result of the mtr merger, we have achieved savings in marketing, food and beverage costs, selling, general and administrative expenses, and other operating departments as a result of operating efficiencies and purchasing power of the combined organization. after a full year of the cost savings program, we exceeded our target of $10.0 million on an annual basis with savings of over $12.5 million. in addition to generating incremental revenues, we have realized, and expect additional savings in 2017 resulting from cost synergies across the reno tri-properties as a result of the reno acquisition.

•   refinancing and reduction in interest expense - in july 2015, we successfully refinanced all of our indebtedness, including the debt we assumed in the mtr merger in 2014. we issued $375.0 million in senior notes and entered into a new $425.0 million term loan and a new $150.0 million revolving credit facility, with the net proceeds utilized to, among other things, purchase our resorts senior secured notes and mtr second lien notes. the refinancing reduced our annualized cash interest payments by approximately $35.0 million. moreover, as a result of significant reductions in our outstanding indebtedness totaling $68.8 million during the year ended december 31, 2016, we realized additional savings in interest expense. see "liquidity and capital resources" for more information related to our 2015 refinancing.

•   income taxes - in 2015, the company recorded a $69.6 million net benefit for income taxes resulting from an adjustment to its valuation allowance. this adjustment was based on management's consideration of all evidence, including the positive impacts of both the company's refinancing and the reno acquisition in 2015, related to the realization of its federal deferred tax assets. (see "income taxes" below).

•   west virginia smoking ban - on august 26, 2014, the board of health of hancock county, west virginia adopted and approved the clean air regulation act of 2014 ("regulation"), which became effective july 1, 2015. the regulation bans smoking in public places in hancock county including mountaineer. to comply with the regulation upon its effective date, mountaineer built a 9,300 square foot smoking pavilion which opened on july 1, 2015. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we added 61 slot machines bringing our total to 322 slot machines and four table games located in the smoking patio. notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate the impact of the smoking ban, the regulation had a negative impact on our business and results of operations at mountaineer.

•   property enhancement capital expenditures - during the fourth quarter of 2015, we began to realize the benefits of our property enhancement initiatives which targeted product and service offering upgrades across our entire portfolio. the completion of these initiatives by year-end 2015 helped drive increased volume to our properties and continues to be well-received by our customers. most notably, the opening of the brew brothers, a restaurant and microbrewery at scioto downs, provided a meaningful increase in traffic and video lottery terminals (vlt) revenues subsequent to its opening in october 2015. additionally, we completed a $5.0 million five-phase design and facility enhancement program at presque isle downs that added a new casino center bar, an improved high limit gaming area and new slot product. in 2015, over 200 rooms were remodeled at eldorado reno and we completely refurbished the exterior of the eldorado shreveport.

we continued our property enhancement initiatives throughout 2016. at presque isle downs, we opened a the brew brothers in may and an escalator in july to improve traffic flow to the restaurant. in june, we opened a second smoking patio at scioto downs which features a casino bar and 119 new vlts. construction of the 118-room hampton inn hotel at scioto downs was completed and is planned to open in march 2017. in shreveport, we completed the remodeling of the second floor of the casino in the fourth quarter of 2016 including the addition of approximately 20 new slot machines. we continue to evaluate the offerings at mountaineer with a goal of maintaining a positive customer experience while right-sizing the property to maximize free cash flow and operational efficiencies.
in september 2016, the company announced that it plans to invest more than $50.0 million in facility enhancements to eldorado reno, silver legacy and circus reno. eldorado's master plan for the three connected properties, which span eight city blocks in downtown reno, will be phased over three years, and commenced in the fourth quarter of 2016. in addition to the renovation of our guest rooms across the tri-properties, each of the three resorts will introduce new restaurant concepts, reinvigorated nightlife and resort amenities, including a new full service luxury spa. the $50.0 million investment will allow the further integration of the guest experience among the reno tri-properties to deliver an enhanced and seamless resort environment. in september 2016, silver legacy opened a new $2.0 million 8,500 square foot sports book. also, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we completed the renovation of the carnival midway, and opened el jefe's cantina mexican restaurant and bar at circus reno. we also opened hidden pizza, a new york style pizza restaurant, at eldorado reno.
beginning in 2017 enhancements continued at the tri-properties including the renovation of approximately 750 guest rooms; a full redesign of the legacy buffet at circus reno to transform it into a modern food court with three distinct offerings; the development of a new waffle house at the former circus steak house; the addition of an arcade and redemption area to replace the circus americana café; and the construction of a canter's deli and new poker room at silver legacy.  these facility upgrades as well as our plans for a new world-class luxury spa at eldorado reno and ultimately new public spaces and room renovations across the complex, are designed to significantly elevate the reno tri-property guest experience.
•   new regulation - effective january 1, 2016, the ohio lottery commission enacted new regulation which resulted in the establishment of a $1.0 million progressive slot liability and a corresponding decrease in net slot win for the year ended december 31, 2016. the changes are non-cash and related to jackpots established in prior years. the net non-cash impact to scioto down's gaming revenues and operating income was $1.0 million and $0.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, respectively.

•   competition - our results of operations over the past three years have been impacted by the expansion of native american gaming operations and regional gaming in our markets. in order to sustain our market share in the increased competitive environment, we continuously reevaluate our advertising strategies and promotional offers to our guests to ensure our reinvestment levels reflect the appropriate level of offerings to improve our margins.

operating results.  net revenues increased 24.1% and 98.9% in 2016 and 2015, respectively, over the same prior year periods primarily due to incremental revenues attributable to the aforementioned reno acquisition and mtr merger. these increases in net revenues were partially offset by decreases in net revenues in the louisiana and eastern segments, which was mainly driven by declines at mountaineer, in 2016 compared to 2015 mainly due to lower casino revenues.
operating income increased 22.9% and 313.1% in 2016 and 2015, respectively, compared to the same prior year periods due to higher net revenues combined with improved operating margins associated with company-wide cost savings initiatives and property enhancement capital expenditures. these increases in operating income were partially offset by incremental depreciation expense resulting from the aforementioned reno acquisition and mtr merger along with higher acquisition costs associated with the isle acquisition.
net income decreased 78.3% in 2016 compared to 2015 despite the increase in operating income. this decline was primarily driven by the $35.6 million gain related to the valuation of the silver legacy joint venture in conjunction with the reno acquisition combined with the aforementioned $69.6 million benefit for income taxes recorded in 2015. additionally, net income in 2016 was impacted by acquisition charges totaling $9.2 million, primarily related to the isle acquisition, a $0.8 million loss on the sale and disposal of a building and equipment related to the closure of a detached fitness center facility at mountaineer and incremental depreciation associated with assets purchased in the reno acquisition. these declines in net income were partially offset by a $10.6 million decrease in interest expense in 2016 resulting from our refinancing in july 2015 and significant debt reductions throughout 2016.
net income increased 891.6% in 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of the same factors impacting operating income, the $35.6 million gain related to the valuation of the silver legacy joint venture in conjunction with the reno acquisition, the aforementioned $69.6 million benefit for income taxes, and the decrease in acquisition costs recorded in 2015. these increases in net income were partially offset by a full year of interest expense in 2015 due to the timing of the mtr merger and assumption of additional debt in 2014.

non-gaming expenses. non-gaming expenses increased $23.9 million in 2015 compared to 2014, of which nevada non-gaming expenses increased $6.1 million due to incremental expenses incurred as a result of the reno acquisition but reflect a reduction of food and entertainment expenses at eldorado reno. non-gaming expenses in louisiana decreased slightly in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower food and beverage expenses associated with a decline in customer counts. the eastern segment contributed $29.3 million of non-gaming expenses in 2015 representing an $18.0 million increase over 2014 due to inclusion of results of operations for the full year for the properties in the eastern segment.
marketing and promotions expenses.  consolidated marketing and promotions expense increased 42.1% in 2015 compared to 2014. this increase was attributable to incremental expenses associated with the reno acquisition combined with a full year of operations in the eastern segment in 2015 compared to the partial period in 2014 offset by overall savings in each segment due to reductions in advertising and marketing programs.
general and administrative expenses.  total general and administrative expenses increased 64.9% in 2015 compared to 2014 partially due to incremental expenses resulting from the reno acquisition, and reflect a reduction of costs associated with lower professional services. louisiana general and administrative expenses increased 1.3% in 2015 compared to 2014. the eastern segment contributed $52.0 million of general and administrative expenses in 2015 compared to $14.9 million in 2014. the increase in the eastern segment was associated with the partial period reporting as a result of the mtr merger in 2014 due to inclusion of results of operations for the full year for the properties in the eastern segment, offset by declines associated with our cost savings initiatives.
corporate expenses.  we incurred $16.5 million in corporate expenses in 2015 compared to $4.6 million in 2014. this increase was mainly due to incremental costs associated with the mtr merger including additional payroll, accounting fees and professional services. additionally, we expensed $0.6 million in costs attributable to the initiation of our equity offering in conjunction with the reno acquisition.
depreciation and amortization expense.  total depreciation and amortization expense increased 98.7% in 2015 compared to 2014 mainly due to additional depreciation associated with acquired assets in conjunction with the reno acquisition and mtr merger. the eastern segment contributed $39.3 million of depreciation and amortization expense in 2015 compared to $12.3 million in 2014.

supplemental unaudited presentation of consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015
adjusted ebitda (defined below), a non gaap financial measure, has been presented as a supplemental disclosure because it is a widely used measure of performance and basis for valuation of companies in our industry and we believe that this non gaap supplemental information will be helpful in understanding the company's ongoing operating results. adjusted ebitda represents operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation, transaction expenses, s-1 expenses, severance expenses and other, which includes equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates, (gain) loss on the sale or disposal of property, and other regulatory gaming assessments, including the impact of the change in regulatory reporting requirements, to the extent that such items existed in the periods presented. adjusted ebitda is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with us gaap, is unaudited and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance. uses of cash flows that are not reflected in adjusted ebitda include capital expenditures, interest payments, income taxes, debt principal repayments and certain regulatory gaming assessments, which can be significant. as a result, adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity. other companies that provide ebitda information may calculate ebitda differently than we do. the definition of adjusted ebitda may not be the same as the definitions used in any of our debt agreements.
the following table summarizes our adjusted ebitda for our operating segments for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, in addition to reconciling adjusted ebitda to operating income (loss) in accordance with us gaap (unaudited, in thousands):

(1)   figures for the year ended december 31, 2015 represent the results of silver legacy and circus reno for the period beginning on january 1, 2015 and ending on november 24, 2015, the date that the reno acquisition was consummated. such figures are based on the unaudited historical internal financial statements of such entities and have not been reviewed by the company's auditors.

(2)   effective january 1, 2016, the ohio lottery commission enacted a regulatory change which resulted in the establishment of a $1.0 million progressive slot liability and a corresponding decrease in net slot win in during the first quarter of 2016. the changes are non-cash and related primarily to prior years. the net non-cash impact to adjusted ebitda was $0.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2016.

(3)   included in stock-based compensation expense for the year ended is $0.8 million of additional stock-based compensation expense as a result of severance related restricted stock units becoming fully vested during the year ended december 31, 2016.

(4)   transaction expenses represent acquisition costs related to the mtr merger and reno acquisition and also include a credit of $2.0 thousand for the year ended december 31, 2016 and an expense of $0.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 related to s-1 offering costs.

(5)   other is comprised of (gain) loss on the sale or disposal of property, equity in income of unconsolidated affiliate and other regulatory gaming assessments, including the item listed in footnote (2) above.

(6)   results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2015 include the operations of silver legacy and circus reno, which were acquired by eri on november 24, 2015, as if the acquisition occurred on january 1, 2015. such presentation does not conform with us gaap or the securities and exchange commission rules for pro forma presentation; however, we have included the combined information because we believe it provides a meaningful comparison for the periods presented.

liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have been existing cash, cash flow from operations and proceeds from the issuance of debt securities.
we expect that our primary capital requirements going forward will relate to the operation and maintenance of our properties and servicing our outstanding indebtedness and to pay the cash consideration in the isle acquisition, refinance outstanding isle indebtedness and pay expenses related to the isle acquisition. in 2017, we plan to spend $60.1 million, net of reimbursements from west virginia, on qualified capital expenditures, $44.6 million to pay cash interest on our senior notes and our new credit facility and $4.3 million for principal payments on our term loan. we expect that our capital requirements for interest on our outstanding indebtedness will increase significantly in 2017 following the consummation of the isle acquisition and the related incurrence of debt.  we also expect that our capital expenditures will increase significantly in 2017 following the consummation of the isle acquisition and the related increase in the number of properties in the combined portfolio of assets. however, we are still evaluating potential capital expenditure requirements and have not quantified the anticipated additional spend at this time. we expect that we will fund amounts required to pay the cash consideration in the isle acquisition, refinance outstanding isle indebtedness and pay expenses related to the isle acquisition with proceeds from borrowings under the financing that we expect to be provided pursuant to the commitment letter and cash on hand. we expect that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital requirements and service our outstanding indebtedness for the foreseeable future; however, we cannot provide assurance that operating cash flows will be sufficient to do so.
eri is a holding company and its only significant assets are ownership interests in its subsidiaries. eri's ability to fund its obligations depends on the cash flow of its subsidiaries and the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute or otherwise make funds available to eri.
at december 31, 2016, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $63.4 million, including restricted cash of $2.4 million. at december 31, 2015, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $83.5 million, including restricted cash of $5.3 million.
operating cash flow.  in 2016, we generated cash flows from operating activities of $97.6 million as compared to $56.7 million in 2015. the increase in operating cash was primarily associated with improvements in operations along with incremental cash flow associated with the reno acquisition, the refinancing of our debt resulting in lower interest expense and various changes in the balance sheet accounts in the normal course of business.
investing cash flow.  net cash flows used in investing activities totaled $41.1 million in 2016 and primarily consisted of $47.4 million in capital expenditures for various property enhancement and maintenance projects and equipment purchases partially offset by west virginia's reimbursement of capital expenditures totaling $4.2 million.
net cash flows used in investing activities totaled $158.8 million in 2015 and partially consisted of $35.5 million in capital expenditures, net of cash reimbursements by west virginia totaling $1.3 million. additionally, $125.0 million of net assets were acquired in the reno acquisition.
financing cash flow.  net cash used for financing activities in 2016 totaled $73.7 million and consisted primarily of payments totaling $64.5 million on the revolving credit facility and $4.3 million payments under the term loan in 2016. additionally, $4.3 million was paid in 2016 for debt issuance costs comprised of $3.6 million related to the isle acquisition and $0.7 million related to the reno acquisition.
net cash flows provided by financing activities in 2015 totaled $92.7 million consisting mainly of the proceeds and associated costs with the issuance of the senior notes and credit facility and the retirement of resorts senior secured notes and mtr second lien notes. subsequent to our refinancing transaction in july 2015, we made payments of $2.1 million and $37.5 million under the term loan and revolving credit facility, respectively, during the latter half of 2015. borrowings totaled $131.0 million under the revolving credit facility and were attributable to the payment of refinancing and the reno acquisition in 2015.
42
capital expenditures during the year ended december 31, 2016, additions to property and equipment and other capital projects aggregated $43.2 million, which included $22.8 million in nevada, $5.9 million in louisiana, $14.3 million attributable to the eastern properties, net of $4.2 million in west virginia reimbursements, and $0.2 million at corporate.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, the west virginia racing commission reimbursed mountaineer $0.7 million for capital expenditures in 2016. these reimbursement amounts were applied against the applicable acquisition costs, which resulted in corresponding adjustments to the basis of the capitalized fixed assets. these reimbursements, which are reflected within investing activities in our accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows, did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. future reimbursements from the west virginia racing commission are subject to the availability of racing funds.
under legislation approved by west virginia in july 2011, mountaineer participates in a modernization fund which provides for reimbursement from amounts paid to the west virginia lottery commission in an amount equal to $1 for each $2 expended for certain qualifying capital expenditures having a useful life of more than three years and placed into service after july 1, 2011. qualifying capital expenditures include the purchase of slot machines and related equipment to the extent such slot machines are retained by mountaineer at its west virginia location for not less than five years. any unexpended balance from a given fiscal year will be available for one additional fiscal year, after which time the remaining unused balance carried forward will be forfeited. during the year ended december 31, 2016, mountaineer was reimbursed $3.5 million on qualified capital expenditures. as of december 31, 2016, mountaineer remains eligible for $3.4 million under annual modernization fund grants that expire in varying dates through june 30, 2018. we can make no assurances mountaineer will be able to make qualifying capital expenditures purchases sufficient to receive reimbursement of the available funds prior to their expiration nor that the modernization funds will continue to be available.
silver legacy joint venture loan and credit support ellc and galleon were each required to provide credit support by depositing $5.0 million of cash into bank accounts that were subject to a security interest in favor of the lender under the silver legacy credit agreement. in november 2015 in conjunction with the reno acquisition, the indebtedness under the silver legacy credit agreement was paid in full by eri and the credit support obligation was eliminated.
debt obligations refinancing transaction and senior notes on july 23, 2015, the company issued $375.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.0% senior notes due 2023 pursuant to the indenture, dated as of july 23, 2015 (the "indenture"), at an issue price equal to 100.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes. the senior notes are guaranteed by all of the company's direct and indirect restricted subsidiaries other than immaterial subsidiaries. cc-reno, llc and the silver legacy joint venture became guarantors in june 2016 upon receipt of gaming approval which occurred in may 2016. the senior notes will mature on august 1, 2023, with interest payable semi-annually in arrears on february 1 and august 1 of each year.
the company used the net proceeds from the senior notes offering together with borrowings under the term loan and the revolving credit facility (as defined below) to (i) purchase or otherwise redeem (a) all of the outstanding resorts senior secured notes and (b) all of the outstanding mtr second lien notes, (ii) pay a portion of the purchase price for the circus reno/silver legacy purchase and repay all amounts outstanding under the silver legacy joint venture credit facility, and (iii) pay fees and costs associated with such transactions. net proceeds from the senior notes offering totaling $50.0 million were used for the circus reno/silver legacy purchase on the reno acquisition date. as a result of the july 2015 refinancing, we recognized a $1.9 million net loss on the early retirement of debt.
43
on or after august 1, 2018, the company may redeem all or a portion of the senior notes upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount) set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, on the senior notes redeemed, to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve month period beginning on august 1 of the years indicated below:
year            percentage

2018         105.250   %
2019         103.500   %
2020         101.750   %
2021 and thereafter         100.000   %
prior to august 1, 2018, the company may redeem all or a portion of the senior notes at a price equal to 100% of the senior notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, plus a make-whole premium.  at any time prior to august 1, 2018, the company is also entitled to redeem up to 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the senior notes with proceeds of certain equity financings at a redemption price equal to 107% of the principal amount of the senior notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. if the company experiences certain change of control events (as defined in the indenture), it must offer to repurchase the senior notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable repurchase date. if the company sells assets under certain circumstances and does not use the proceeds for specified purposes, the company must offer to repurchase the senior notes at 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable repurchase date. the senior notes are subject to redemption imposed by gaming laws and regulations of applicable gaming regulatory authorities.
the indenture contains certain covenants limiting, among other things, the company's ability and the ability of its subsidiaries (other than its unrestricted subsidiaries) to:
•   pay dividends or distributions or make certain other restricted payments or investments;

•   incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue disqualified stock or create subordinated indebtedness that is not subordinated to the senior notes or the guarantees of the senior notes;

•   create liens;

•   transfer and sell assets;

•   merge, consolidate, or sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the company's assets;

•   enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

•   engage in lines of business other than the company's core business and related businesses; and

•   create restrictions on dividends or other payments by restricted subsidiaries.

these covenants are subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications as set forth in the indenture. the indenture also provides for customary events of default which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on such senior notes to be declared due and payable. as of december 31, 2016, the company was in compliance with all of the covenants under the indenture relating to the senior notes.
credit facility on july 23, 2015, the company entered into a new $425.0 million seven year term loan (the "term loan") and a new $150.0 million five year revolving credit facility (the "revolving credit facility" and, together with the term loan, the "credit facility").
as of december 31, 2016, the company had $418.6 million outstanding on the term loan and $29.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility.  the company had $121.0 million of available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2016. at december 31, 2016, the interest rate on the term loan was 4.25% and the average interest rate on the revolving credit facility was 4.9%.
44
the term loan bears interest at a rate per annum of, at the company's option, either (x) libor plus 3.25%, with a libor floor of 1.0%, or (y) a base rate plus 2.25%. borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum of, at the company's option, either (x) libor plus a spread ranging from 2.5% to 3.25% or (y) a base rate plus a spread ranging from 1.5% to 2.25%, in each case with the spread determined based on the company's total leverage ratio.  additionally, the company pays a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility not being utilized in the amount of 0.50% per annum.
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company's personal property assets and substantially all personal property assets of each subsidiary that guaranties the credit facility (other than certain subsidiary guarantors designated as immaterial or restricted subsidiaries) (the ''credit facility guarantors''), whether owned on the closing date of the credit facility or thereafter acquired, and mortgages on the real property and improvements owned or leased us or the credit facility guarantors. the credit facility is also secured by a pledge of all of the equity owned by us and the credit facility guarantors (subject to certain gaming law restrictions). the credit agreement governing the credit facility contains a number of customary covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the company's ability and the ability of the credit facility guarantors to incur additional indebtedness, create liens on collateral, engage in mergers, consolidations or asset dispositions, make distributions, make investments, loans or advances, engage in certain transactions with affiliates or subsidiaries or make capital expenditures.
the credit agreement governing the credit facility also includes requirements that the company maintain a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio (adjusting over time). the company is required to maintain a maximum total leverage ratio of 6.00 to 1.00 from january 1, 2016 to december 31, 2017 and 5.00 to 1.00 thereafter. in addition, the company is required to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.75 to 1.00 from january 1, 2016 through december 31, 2016 and 3.00 to 1.00 thereafter. a default of the financial ratio covenants shall only become an event of default under the term loan if the lenders providing the revolving credit facility take certain affirmative actions after the occurrence of a default of such financial ratio covenants.
the credit agreement governing the credit facility contains a number of customary events of default, including, among others, for the non-payment of principal, interest or other amounts, the inaccuracy of certain representations and warranties, the failure to perform or observe certain covenants, a cross default to other indebtedness including the senior notes, certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency; certain erisa events, the invalidity of certain loan documents, certain changes of control and the loss of certain classes of licenses to conduct gaming. if any event of default occurs, the lenders under the credit facility would be entitled to take various actions, including accelerating amounts due thereunder and taking all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. as of december 31, 2016, the company was in compliance with the covenants under the credit facility.
debt commitment letter in connection with entering into the merger agreement, on september 19, 2016, the company entered into a debt financing commitment letter with jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., as modified by the five separate written joinders to the commitment letter entered into by eri and jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. with each of  macquarie capital funding llc, keybank, national association, capital one, national association, suntrust bank and u.s. bank national association and certain affiliates of such parties (the "commitment letter"). the commitment letter provides for : (a) a senior secured credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.75 billion comprised of (i) a term loan facility of up to $1.45 billion and (ii) a revolving credit facility of $300.0 million and (b) an amount equal to at least $375.0 million in gross proceeds from the issuance and sale by the company of senior unsecured notes or, if the notes are not issued and sold on or prior to the date of the consummation of the mergers, an amount equal to at least $375.0 million in senior unsecured bridge loans under a senior unsecured credit facility. the proceeds of such borrowings may be used (w) to pay consideration in the mergers, (x) refinance all of isle's existing credit facilities and senior and senior subordinated notes, (y) refinance the company's existing credit facility and (z) pay transaction fees and expenses related to the foregoing. the availability of the borrowings is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions.

(3)   includes an annual table gaming license fee of $2.5 million for mountaineer which is due on july 1st of each year as long as mountaineer operates table games. includes our obligation for gaming taxes at presque isle downs, which is set at a minimum of $10.0 million per year, as required by the pennsylvania gaming control board. also includes our obligation at presque isle downs, as the holder of a category 1 license, to create a fund to be used for the improvement and maintenance of the backside area of the racetrack with an amount of not less than $250,000 or more than $1 million annually for a five-year period beginning in 2017.

(4)   pursuant to an agreement with the mountaineer park horsemen's benevolent and protective association, inc. and/or in accordance with the west virginia racing statute, mountaineer is required to utilize its best efforts to conduct racing for a minimum of 210 days and pay average daily minimum purses established by mountaineer prior to the first live racing date each year ($96,000 for 2016) for the term of the agreement which expires on december 31, 2018.

(5)   in connection with the 2003 purchase of scioto downs, certain stockholders of scioto downs elected the option to receive cash and contingent earn‐out payments ("cep rights") in lieu of all cash for their outstanding shares of scioto downs' common stock. the triggering event occurred when scioto downs received its permanent vlt license in may 2012 and commenced gaming operations. as a result, we recorded a liability for the estimated ten year payout to the stockholders who elected to receive the cep rights. the future obligation was calculated based on scioto downs' projected ebitda for the ten calendar years beginning january 1, 2013.

(6)   these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheets, which are included elsewhere in this report. see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our regulatory gaming assessments.

inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our revenues, results of operations or cash flows since inception.
other liquidity matters the pennsylvania gaming control board (the "pgcb"), the pennsylvania department of revenue and the pennsylvania state police (collectively "the borrowers"), were required to fund the costs they incurred in connection with the initial development of the infrastructure to support gaming operations in pennsylvania as well as the initial ongoing costs of the borrowers. the initial funding of these costs was provided from a loan from the pennsylvania general fund in the amount of $36.1 million, and further funding was provided from additional loans from the pennsylvania property tax reserve fund in the aggregate amount of $63.8 million.
the pennsylvania department of revenue will assess all licensees, including presque isle downs, their proportionate share of amounts represented by the borrowings, which are in the aggregate amount of $99.9 million, once the designated number of pennsylvania's slot machine licensees is operational. on july 11, 2011, the pgcb issued an administrative order which established that payments associated with the $63.8 million that was borrowed from the property tax reserve fund would commence on january 1, 2012. the repayment allocation between all current licensees is based upon equal weighting of (i) cumulative gross slot revenue since inception in relation to the combined cumulative gross slot revenue for all licensees and (ii) single year gross slot revenue (during the state's fiscal year ending june 30) in relation to the combined single year gross slot revenue for all licensees; and amounts paid each year will be adjusted annually based upon changes in the licensee's proportionate share of gross slot revenue. we have estimated that our total proportionate share of the aggregate $63.8 million to be assessed to the gaming facilities will be $4.1 million and will be paid quarterly over a ten‐year period, which began effective january 1, 2012. for the $36.1 million that was borrowed from the general fund, payment is scheduled to begin after all fourteen licensees are operational. although we cannot determine when payment will begin, we have considered a similar repayment model for the general fund borrowings and estimated that our total proportionate share of the aggregate $36.1 million to all fourteen gaming facilities will be $1.9 million.
the recorded estimate is subject to revision based upon future changes in the revenue assumptions utilized to develop the estimate. our estimated total obligation at december 31, 2016 is $3.7 million. the company paid $0.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2016.
we are faced with certain contingencies involving litigation and environmental remediation and compliance. these commitments and contingencies are discussed in greater detail in "part i, item 3. legal proceedings" and note 16 to our consolidated financial statements, both of which are included elsewhere in this report. in addition, new competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, and could have a similar adverse effect on our liquidity. see "part i, item 1a. risk factors-risks related to our business" which is included elsewhere in this report.
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this report. these policies, along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by our management in their application, have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ from our estimates.
business combinations the company applied the provisions of accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 805, "business combinations", in the accounting for the circus reno/silver legacy purchase and the mtr merger. it required us to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. goodwill as of the reno acquisition date was measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
47
accounting for business combinations required our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, including our estimate of intangible assets, such as gaming licenses, trade names and loyalty programs. although we believe the assumptions and estimates made have been reasonable and appropriate, they are inherently uncertain. for our gaming license valuation, our properties estimated future cash flows were the primary assumption in the respective intangible valuations. cash flow estimates included assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance, net win per unit (revenue), patron visits and growth percentages. the growth percentages were developed considering general macroeconomic conditions as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition through a review of customer market data, operating margins, and current regulatory, social and economic climates. the most significant of the assumptions used in the valuations included: (1) revenue growth/decline percentages; (2) discount rates; (3) effective income tax rates; (4) future terminal values and (5) capital expenditure assumptions. these assumptions were developed for each of our properties based on historical trends in the current competitive markets in which they operate, and projections of future performance and competition. the primary assumptions with respect to our trade names and loyalty program intangibles primary assumptions were selecting the appropriate royalty rates and cost estimates for replacement cost analyses.
in addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the business combination date. we reevaluated these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the business combination date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance's or contingency's estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have material impact on our results of operations and financial position.
revenue recognition gaming revenues consist of the net win from gaming activities, which is the difference between amounts wagered and amounts paid to winning patrons, and is recognized at the time wagers are made net of winning payouts to patrons. base and progressive jackpots are accrued and charged to revenue at the time the obligation to pay the jackpot is established. pari‐mutuel commissions consist of commissions earned from thoroughbred and harness racing, and importing of simulcast signals from other race tracks. pari‐mutuel commissions are recognized at the time wagers are made. such commissions are a designated portion of the wagering handle as determined by state racing commissions, and are shown net of the taxes assessed by state and local agencies, as well as purses and other contractual amounts paid to horsemen associations. we recognize revenues from fees earned through the exporting of simulcast signals to other race tracks at the time wagers are made. such fees are based upon a predetermined percentage of handle as contracted with the other race tracks. revenues from food and beverage are recognized at the time of sale and revenues from lodging are recognized on the date of stay. other revenues are recorded at the time services are rendered or merchandise sold. we offer certain promotional allowances to our customers, including complimentary lodging, food and beverage, and promotional credits for free play on slot machines. the retail value of these promotional items is shown as a reduction in total revenues on our consolidated statements of operations.
income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file us federal income tax returns and various state and local income tax returns. the company does not have tax sharing agreements with the other members within the consolidated eri group. with few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to us federal or state and local tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2013.
the company was notified by the internal revenue service in october of 2016 that its federal tax return for the year ended december 31, 2014 had been selected for examination.  as of december 31, 2016, there have been no proposed adjustments.  management believes that its tax positions are appropriate and that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.  however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty.  if any issues addressed in the company's tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we would be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.  while the company believes its reported results are materially accurate, any significant adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations, cash flows and financial position if not resolved within expectations.
48
for the year ended december 31, 2014, the difference between the effective rate and the statutory rate is attributed primarily to the federal and state valuation allowances on the company's deferred tax assets. as a result of the company's net operating losses and net deferred tax asset position as of december 31, 2014 (after exclusion of certain deferred tax liabilities that generally cannot be offset against deferred tax assets, known as "naked credits"), the company provided for a full valuation allowance against substantially all of the net federal and state deferred tax assets.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, the difference between the effective rate and the statutory rate is attributable primarily to the release of a majority of the federal and related state valuation allowances on the company's deferred tax assets and the non-taxable gain on the fair value adjustment of a previously unconsolidated affiliate.  the company continues to provide for a valuation allowance against net federal and state deferred tax assets associated with non-operating land, the sale of which could result in capital losses that can only be offset against capital gains. as of december 31, 2015, the company also continued to provide for a valuation allowance against net state deferred tax assets relating to operations in pennsylvania and west virginia. management determined it was not more-likely-than-not that the company will realize these net deferred tax assets.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, the difference between the effective rate and the statutory rate is attributable primarily to the release of a majority of the state valuation allowances on the company's west virginia deferred tax assets and excess tax benefits on stock compensation under accounting standards update 2016-09, compensation - stock compensation, which the company adopted effective the first quarter of 2016.  the company continues to provide for a valuation allowance against net federal and state deferred tax assets associated with non-operating land, the sale of which could result in capital losses that can only be offset against capital gains. the company also continues to provide for a valuation allowance against net state deferred tax assets relating to operations in pennsylvania. management determined it was not more-likely-than-not that the company will realize these net deferred tax assets.
a valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. management must analyze all available positive and negative evidence regarding realization of the deferred tax assets and make an assessment of the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income. for the year ended december 31, 2014, the company was in a three-year cumulative loss position, which was significant negative evidence, and the company did not have positive evidence to outweigh the negative evidence.  for the year ended december 31, 2015, the company's position changed to a three-year cumulative income position and management concluded it is more-likely-than-not to realize its federal, louisiana and city of columbus, ohio deferred tax assets, with the exception of non-operating land. in addition, for the year ended december 31, 2016, the company remained in a three-year cumulative income position and management concluded it is more-likely-than-not to realize its federal, louisiana, city of columbus, ohio and west virginia deferred tax assets, with the exception of non-operating land. the company continues to provide for a valuation allowance against net state deferred tax assets relating to operations in pennsylvania. management determined it was not more-likely-than-not that the company will realize these net deferred tax assets.  the company will continue to evaluate the realization of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and make adjustments to its valuation allowance as appropriate.
for income tax purposes the company amortizes or depreciates certain assets that have been assigned an indefinite life for book purposes. for the year ended december 31, 2014, the incremental amortization or depreciation deductions for income tax purposes resulted in an increase in certain deferred tax liabilities that could not be used as a source of future taxable income for purposes of measuring the company's need for a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets. therefore, the company recorded non‐cash deferred tax expense of $1.1 million as the company amortized these assets for tax purposes.
prior to the mtr merger date, holdco was taxed as a partnership under the internal revenue code pursuant to which income taxes were primarily the responsibility of the partners. the company is a c corporation subject to the federal and state corporate‐level income taxes at prevailing corporate tax rates. while taxed as a partnership, holdco was not subject to federal income tax liability. because holders of membership interests in holdco were required to include their respective shares of holdco's taxable income (including that of resorts) in their individual income tax returns, distributions were made to their respective member(s) to cover such tax liabilities. such distributions were subject to limitation in accordance with the provisions of their respective operating agreements. eldorado shreveport #2, llc has elected as a single member limited liability company to be taxed as a c corporation. current and deferred income taxes associated with eldorado shreveport #2, llc were not material.
49
under the applicable accounting standards, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more‐likely‐than‐not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the accounting standards also provide guidance on de‐recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions. we have recorded no liability associated with uncertain tax positions at december 31, 2016 and 2015.
property and equipment and other long‐lived assets property and equipment is recorded at cost, except for the silver legacy, circus reno and the mtr gaming properties, which were adjusted for fair value under asc 805 and are depreciated over their remaining estimated useful life or lease term. judgments are made in determining estimated useful lives and salvage values of these assets. the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and whether we have a gain or loss on the disposal of assets. we review depreciation estimates and methods as new events occur, more experience is acquired, and additional information is obtained that would possibly change our current estimates.
property, equipment and other long‐lived assets are assessed for impairment in accordance with asc 360-property, plant, and equipment. the company evaluates its long‐lived assets periodically for impairment issues or, more frequently, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the net carrying value to the sum of the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets. the amount of impairment loss, if any, is measured by the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset which is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model (level 3 of the fair value hierarchy). for assets to be disposed of, impairment is recognized based on the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. based on the results of our periodic reviews we have not recorded any impairment losses during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
for undeveloped properties, including non‐operating real properties, when indicators of impairment are present, properties are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset or market comparisons are less than the asset's carrying amount. the amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value, which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, management estimates or market comparisons. the fair value measurements employed for our impairment evaluations, which are subject to the assumptions and factors as previously discussed, were generally based on a review of comparable activities in the marketplace, which falls within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
goodwill and other indefinite‐lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business. intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based upon their fair value at the date of acquisition. goodwill and other indefinite‐lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually, during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired.
goodwill is tested by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value. the company estimates the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing income and market approaches. the income approach is based on projected future cash flow that is discounted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows. the market approach is based on the company's market capitalization at the testing date.
our indefinite‐lived intangible assets consist of racing and gaming licenses and trade names and are evaluated for impairment annually by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. any excess of carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment within the consolidated statement of operations in the period of review.
50
the gaming and racing licenses were valued in aggregate for each respective property, as these licenses are considered to be the most significant asset of the properties and the gaming licenses could not be obtained without holding the racing licenses. therefore, a market participant would consider the licenses in aggregate. the fair value of the licenses is calculated using an excess earnings methodology, which is an income approach methodology that allocates the projected cash flows of the property to the gaming license intangible assets less charges for the use of the other identifiable assets of the property, including working capital, fixed assets, and other intangible assets. we believe this methodology is appropriate as the gaming licenses are the primary asset to the properties, the licenses are linked to each respective facility and it's the lowest level at which discrete cash flows can be directly attributable to the assets. under the gaming legislation applicable to our properties, licenses are property specific and can only be acquired if a buyer acquires the existing facility. because existing licenses may not be acquired and transferred for use at a different facility, the estimated future cash flows of each of our properties was the primary assumption in the valuation of such property.
the company values trade names using the relief‐from‐royalty method with royalty rates range from 0.5% ‐ 1.0%.  trade names recorded as part of the mtr merger are amortized on a straight‐line basis over a 3.5 year useful life and the trade names recorded as part of the reno acquisition are not amortized (deemed indefinite-lived).
the loyalty programs were valued using a combination of a replacement cost and lost profits analysis and the loyalty programs are amortized on a straight‐line basis over a one year useful life.
assessing goodwill and indefinite‐lived intangible assets for impairment is a process that requires significant judgment and involves detailed quantitative and qualitative business‐specific analysis and many individual assumptions which fluctuate between assessments. our properties' estimated future cash flows are a primary assumption in the respective impairment analyses. unforeseen events, changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge, which could be material. cash flow estimates include assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance, net win per unit (revenue), patron visits, growth percentages which are developed considering general macroeconomic conditions as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition through a review of customer market data, operating margins, and current regulatory, social and economic climates. these estimates could also be negatively impacted by changes in federal, state, or local regulations, economic downturns or developments and other market conditions affecting travel and access to the properties. the most significant of the assumptions used in our valuations include: (1) revenue growth/decline percentages; (2) discount rates; (3) effective income tax rates; (4) future terminal values and (5) capital expenditure assumptions. these assumptions were developed for each property based on historical trends, the current competitive markets in which they operate, and projections of future performance and competition.
we believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and other indefinite‐lived intangible assets; however, these estimates and assumptions could be materially different from actual results. if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected, or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of our licensing intangibles below the carrying value reflected on the consolidated balance sheet, we may be required to conduct an interim test or possibly recognize impairment charges, which may be material, in future periods.
reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable we reserve an estimated amount for receivables that may not be collected. methodologies for estimating bad debt reserves range from specific reserves to various percentages applied to aged receivables. historical collection rates are considered, as are customer relationships, in determining specific reserves. as with many estimates, management must make judgments about potential actions by third parties in establishing and evaluating our reserves for bad debts.
self‐insurance reserves the company is self‐insured for various levels of general liability, employee medical insurance coverage and workers' compensation coverage. self‐insurance reserves are estimated based on the company's claims experience and are included in accrued other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

loyalty program we offer programs whereby our participating patrons can accumulate points for wagering that can be redeemed for credits for free play on slot machines, lodging, food and beverage, merchandise and in limited situations, cash. based upon the estimated redemptions of loyalty program points, an estimated liability is established for the cost of redemption on earned but unredeemed points. the estimated cost of redemption utilizes estimates and assumptions of the mix of the various product offerings for which the points will be redeemed and costs of such product offerings. changes in the programs, membership levels and redemption patterns of our participating patrons can impact this liability.
litigation, claims and assessments we utilize estimates for litigation, claims and assessments. these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events, as well as assumptions about future events. if our assessment of such a matter should change, we may have to change the estimates, which may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. actual results could differ from these estimates.
recently issued accounting pronouncements in may 2014 (amended january 2017), the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2014‐09, "revenue from contracts with customers," which provides guidance for revenue recognition. the new standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and eliminates existing industry guidance, including revenue recognition guidance specific to the gaming industry. the fasb has also recently issued several amendments to the standard, including narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients (asu 2016-12) and clarification on accounting for and identifying performance obligations (asu 2016-10). the core principle of the revenue model indicates that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. the standard is designed to create greater comparability for financial statement users across industries and jurisdictions and also requires enhanced disclosures. the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2017, and should be applied using the full retrospective method or retrospectively with the cumulative effect initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application. while early adoption is permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016, we anticipate adopting this standard on january 1, 2018. we are currently in the process of evaluating the full impact adoption of asu 2014‐09 (as amended) will have on our consolidated financial statements; however, we anticipate this new standard will likely have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
we expect the most significant effect upon adoption of asu 2014-09 (as amended) will likely be related to 1) the accounting for our customer loyalty program (no longer be recorded at cost, and a deferred revenue model will likely be used to account for the classification and timing of revenue recognized as well as the classification of related expenses for loyalty point redemptions) and 2) the elimination of promotional allowances (the presentation of goods and services provided to our customers without charge, included in gross revenue with a corresponding reduction in promotional allowances, will no longer be reported as revenue and will be recognized based on relative standalone selling prices for transactions with more than one performance obligation). as a result, we expect that gaming revenues will be reduced with a corresponding increase, in total, to food and beverage, hotel, and other revenues. given our evaluation process is ongoing, the quantitative effects of these changes have not yet been fully determined and are still being analyzed. additionally, as we continue through our process, further impacts to our financial statements may be identified and we will provide updates in our upcoming quarterly filings.
in january 2017, the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no. 2017-04, "intangibles - goodwill and other: simplifying the test for goodwill impairment." this amended guidance is intended to simplify how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. step 2 measures goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. under the amended guidance, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. the elimination of step 2 from the goodwill impairment test should reduce the cost and complexity of evaluating goodwill for impairment. amendments should be applied on a prospective basis disclosing the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle upon transition. disclosure should be provided in the first annual period and in the interim period in which the entity initially adopts the amendments. updated amendments are effective for the interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact and timing of adopting this guidance, but anticipate early adoption in 2017.

in january 2017, the fasb issued asu no. 2017-01, "business combinations - clarifying the definition of a business." this amendment is intended to clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisition (or disposals) of assets or businesses. amendments in this update provide a more robust framework to use in determining when a set of assets and activities is a business and to provide more consistency in applying the guidance, reduce the costs of application, and make the definition of a business more operable. the amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is allowed as follows: (1) transactions for which acquisition date occurs before the issuance date or effective date of the amendments, only when the transaction has not been reported in financial statements that have been issued or made available for issuance and (2) transactions in which a subsidiary is deconsolidated or a group of assets is derecognized that occur before the issuance date or effective date of the amendments, only when the transaction has not been reported in financial statements that have been issued or made available for issuance. the adoption will result in future acquisitions which do not involve substantive processes being accounted for as asset acquisitions.
in november 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-18, "statement of cash flows - restricted cash." this guidance requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash and cash equivalents. the amendments in this update are effective for the interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. we currently anticipate adopting this accounting standard during the first quarter of 2018 and we are still evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in august 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-15, "classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments." this new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and payments are classified in the statement of cash flows, including debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, the settlement of contingent liabilities arising from a business combination, proceeds from insurance settlements, and distributions from certain equity method investees. the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. the guidance requires application using a retrospective transition method. we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
in june 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-13, "accounting for credit losses," which amends the guidance on the impairment of financial instruments. this update adds an impairment model (known as the current expected credit losses model) that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. under the new guidance, an entity recognizes, as an allowance, its estimate of expected credit losses. the effective date for this update is for the annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted beginning after december 15, 2018. we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
in march 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-09, "compensation-stock compensation." this asu includes multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for share-based payments. these areas include income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or a liability, and classification on the statement of cash flow. the effective date is for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. we elected to early adopt this asu prospectively in the first quarter of 2016. under the new guidance, we recognized a reduction in income tax expense of $0.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. there were no excess tax benefits for the year ended december 31, 2015.
in february 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-02 which addresses the recognition and measurement of leases. under the new guidance, for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases), at the commencement date, lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis, and a right-of-use ("rou") asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. further, the new lease guidance simplifies the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and liabilities, which no longer provides a source for off balance sheet financing. the effective date for this update is for the annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. lessees and lessors must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the consolidated financial statements.

currently, we do not have any material capital leases nor any material operating leases where we are the lessor. our operating leases, primarily relating to certain ground leases and slot machines or video lottery terminals (vlts), will be recorded on the balance sheet as an rou asset with a corresponding lease liability, which will be amortized using the effective interest rate method as payments are made. the rou asset will be depreciated on a straight-line basis and recognized as lease expense. the qualitative and quantitative effects of adoption of asu 2016-02 are still being analyzed, and we are in the process of evaluating the full effect the new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.
in september 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-16, business combinations (topic 805): simplifying the accounting for measurement-period adjustments. this asu eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. instead, an acquirer will recognize a measurement-period adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment. we adopted this guidance during the first quarter of 2016 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2016.
in july 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-11, "simplifying the measurement of inventory," which requires that inventory within the scope of asu 2015-11 be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. inventory measured using last-in, first-out (lifo) and the retail inventory method are not impacted by the new guidance. asu 2015-11 applies to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out (fifo) or average cost. an entity should measure inventory within the scope of asu 2015-11 at the lower of cost and net realizable value. net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. asu 2015-11 is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016. early adoption is permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
in january 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015‐01, "income statement-extraordinary and unusual items" (subtopic 225‐20) which eliminates the concept of accounting of extraordinary items, previously defined as items that are both unusual and infrequent, which were reported as a separate item on the income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations. the elimination of this concept is intended to simplify accounting for unusual items and more closely align with international accounting practices. this amendment was effective for annual periods ending after december 15, 2015 and for subsequent interim and annual periods thereafter. as of december 31, 2016, we adopted this guidance which had no impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in august 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014‐15, "presentation of financial statements-going concern" (subtopic 205‐40) which amends the current guidance in asc topic 205 by adding subtopic 40. subtopic 40 requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that in aggregate would raise substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial statements are issued or available to be issued. if substantial doubt existed, management would be required to make certain disclosures related to nature of the substantial doubt and under certain circumstances, how that substantial doubt would be mitigated. this amendment is effective for annual periods ending after december 15, 2016 and for subsequent interim and annual periods thereafter. as of december 31, 2016, we adopted this guidance and based on our evaluation no conditions and events that could raise substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern were known.
in june 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-12, compensation - stock compensation with respect to performance share awards. this accounting standards update requires that a performance target that affects vesting, and that could be achieved after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition. as such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair value of the award. this update further clarifies that compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period or periods for which the requisite service has already been rendered. the effective date for this update was for the annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2015, and we applied this guidance in the accompanying consolidated financial statements effective january 1, 2016. adoption of this accounting standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

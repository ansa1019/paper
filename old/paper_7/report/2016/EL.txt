item 7.  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition at june 30, 2016 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended june 30, 2016 are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap).  the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.  these estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates.  we consider accounting estimates to be critical if both (i) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the companys financial condition.  our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets and income taxes.
management of the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the companys board of directors.

revenue recognition our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales.  this accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and information provided by retailers regarding their inventory levels.  consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations.  experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period, as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business.  in addition, as necessary, specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events.  the types of known or anticipated events that we have considered, and will continue to consider, include, but are not limited to, the financial condition of our customers, store closings by retailers, changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue to support new and existing products.
for a discussion of our revenue recognition accounting policy, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data  note 2  summary of significant accounting policies.
inventory we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair-market value, with cost being based on standard cost and production variances, which approximate actual cost on the first-in, first-out method.  we believe this method most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale.  the reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products, promotional products, raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods.
we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value, based on various product sales projections.  this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales.  in addition, and as necessary, we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events.
for further discussion of our inventory accounting policy, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data  note 2  summary of significant accounting policies.
pension and other post-retirement benefit costs we offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees: a domestic trust-based noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan (u.s. qualified plan) and an unfunded, non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations (collectively with the u.s. qualified plan, the domestic plans); a domestic contributory defined contribution plan; international pension plans, which vary by country, consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans; deferred compensation arrangements; and certain other post-retirement benefit plans.
the amounts needed to fund future payouts under our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans are subject to numerous assumptions such as an anticipated discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, mortality rates and future compensation levels.  we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and select assumptions that we believe reflect the economics underlying our pension and post-retirement obligations.  while we believe these assumptions are within accepted industry ranges, an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings.
the discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds.  for fiscal 2016, net periodic benefit cost was determined using discount rates for our domestic plans of 4.40% and 3.70% and varying rates on our international plans between 0.75% and 7.00%.  the discount rates for our domestic plans were based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency.  we used an above-mean yield curve which represents an estimate of the effective settlement rate of the obligation, and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our domestic plans.  for our international plans, the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in each country, with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan.
- 23 -
for fiscal 2016, we used an expected return on plan assets of 7.00% for our u.s. qualified plan and varying rates of between 2.00% and 7.00% for our international plans.  in determining the long-term rate of return for a plan, we consider the historical rates of return, the nature of the plans investments and an expectation for the plans investment strategies.  see item 8.  financial statements and supplementary data  note 13  pension, deferred compensation and post-retirement benefit plans for details regarding the nature of our pension and post-retirement plan investments.  the difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.  those gains/losses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods.  for fiscal 2016, our pension plans had actual return on assets of approximately $84 million as compared with expected return on assets of approximately $68 million.  the resulting net deferred gain of approximately $16 million, when combined with gains and losses from previous years, will be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 8 to 19 years.  the actual return on plan assets from our global pension plans was higher than expected, primarily due to strong performance of fixed income assets attributable to our international pension plan in the united kingdom and the u.s. qualified plan, partially offset by equity underperformance globally.
a 25 basis-point change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2016 pension expense:
(in millions)           25 basis-point          25 basis-point increase                decrease

discount rate               $(4.3               )                $4.4
expected return on assets   $(2.9               )                $2.8
our post-retirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates, which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported.  a 100 basis-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2016 would have had the following effects:
(in millions)                    100 basis-point     100 basis-point increase            decrease

effect on total service and interest costs                   $1.2   $(0.9               )
effect on post-retirement benefit obligations               $14.8   $(12.7              )
to determine the fiscal 2017 net periodic benefit cost, we are using discount rates of 3.70% and 3.00% for the u.s. qualified plan and the non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan, respectively, and varying rates for our international plans of between .25% and 6.00%.  we are using an expected return on plan assets of 7.00% for the u.s. qualified plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between 1.50% and 6.00%.  the net change in these two key assumptions from those used in fiscal 2016 will result in an increase in pension expense of approximately $17 million in fiscal 2017.
goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets.  other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks.  goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.
when testing goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. for fiscal 2016 and 2015, we elected to perform the qualitative assessment for the majority of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets.  this qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the fair values of our reporting units were below carrying value. for those reporting units acquired in fiscal 2015, a quantitative assessment was performed.  we engaged third-party valuation specialists and used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management.
for further discussion of the methods used and factors considered in our estimates as part of the impairment testing for goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data  note 2  summary of significant accounting policies.
income taxes we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns.  as of june 30, 2016, we have net deferred tax assets of $422.3 million.  the net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization, as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates.  included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of $118.4 million for deferred tax assets, where management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction.

we provide tax reserves for u.s. federal, state, local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit.  the development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate.  we assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon managements evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates.
for further discussion of our income taxes accounting policy, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data  note 2  summary of significant accounting policies.
quantitative analysis during the three-year period ended june 30, 2016, there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies, nor to the related significant estimates.  the results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations.
while we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects, other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales, cost of sales or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns, inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes.
a 250 basis-point change in the items above collectively would have had the following effects for fiscal 2016:

in order to meet the demands of consumers, we continually introduce new products, support new and established products through advertising, merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives.  the economics of developing, producing, launching, supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period.  the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning.
non-gaap financial measures we use certain non-gaap financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business.  management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between two periods.  while we consider the non-gaap measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap.  see reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures beginning on page 42 for reconciliations between non-gaap financial measures and the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measures.
we operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net sales generated outside the united states.  accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations.  therefore, we present certain net sales, operating results and diluted net earnings per common share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the united states.  constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period.  we calculate constant currency information by translating current year results using prior year weighted-average foreign currency exchange rates.
overview we believe the best way to continue to increase stockholder value is to provide our customers and consumers with superior products and services in the most efficient and profitable manner while recognizing consumers changing behaviors and shopping preferences.  we are guided by our long-term strategy through fiscal 2019, which has numerous initiatives across geographic regions, product categories, brands, channels of distribution and functions that are designed to grow our sales, provide cost efficiencies, leverage our strengths and make us more productive and profitable.  we plan to continue to build upon and leverage our history of outstanding creativity, innovation, entrepreneurship, high quality products and services, and engaging communications while investing for long-term sustainable growth.

our diverse and highly desirable brand portfolio positions us well to capitalize on opportunities in fast growing and profitable areas of prestige beauty. we believe our range of prestige product offerings allows us to increase our share of a consumers beauty routine and source consumers from brands sold in mass distribution.  skin care, our most profitable product category historically, remains a strategic priority for us, and we continue to support our large, long-standing skin care product lines including advanced night repair from estée lauder, cliniques 3-step skin care system and crème de la mer from la mer.  we have also continued to develop and introduce new products, such as new dimension and re-nutriv ultimate diamond transformative energy eye crème from estée lauder, clinique smart moisturizers, clinique smart treatment oil and clinique sculptwear lift and contour serum for face and neck, as well as the renewal oil and genaissance de la mer the serum essence from la mer.  we supplemented our skin care offerings through the fiscal 2015 acquisitions of glamglow and rodin olio lusso. while growth in global prestige skin care remained relatively slow in fiscal 2016, growth in global prestige makeup continued to show the fastest acceleration.  this trend benefited our makeup sales, particularly in certain areas in europe, the middle east & africa, such as the united kingdom.  we also introduced new products, including new collections from our makeup artist brands and smashbox, double wear makeup to go liquid compact and pure color envy liquid lip potion from estée lauder, and chubby lash fattening mascara and beyond perfecting foundation + concealer from clinique.  we believe that the makeup category represents one of our most compelling growth opportunities.  our fragrance category continues to benefit from increased sales of jo malone london and tom ford fragrances, new launches such as mimosa & cardamom from jo malone london and tom ford noir pour femme, and incremental net sales from our fiscal 2015 acquisitions of le labo and editions de parfums frédéric malle.  in addition, we are expanding our hair care brands in salons and other retail channels.  to complement the strategies in our existing business, we are continuously looking to acquire and grow smaller brands that we believe have significant growth potential and may provide unique opportunities for profitable growth in the future.  during our fiscal 2016 third quarter, we further expanded our luxury fragrance portfolio with the acquisition of by kilian, a prestige fragrance brand.
our global footprint provides many avenues of growth.  we are leveraging our regional organizations and the talents and expertise of our people in an effort to continue to be locally relevant with our products, services, channels, marketing and visual merchandising.  we are seeking share growth in large, image-building core markets such as the united states, the united kingdom, france, italy, japan and korea by strengthening our presence in these areas.  during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we purchased a minority interest in have & be co. ltd., the korean company behind the skin care brands dr. jart + and do the right thing. this investment provides us with a strategic opportunity to participate in the expanding korean beauty trend.  in addition, we are broadening our presence in emerging markets such as china, the middle east, eastern europe, brazil, russia, india, mexico and south africa.  while we continue to see slow department store traffic in some markets, which is particularly affecting estée lauder and clinique, we are growing faster in other channels such as e- and m-commerce.
in north america, we are hosting targeted in-store events to support key innovations in multiple channels, and we are increasing our presence in specialty multi-brand retailers and freestanding retail stores.  internationally, we are expanding our business in freestanding stores, in european perfumeries and pharmacies, and in department stores, particularly in the united kingdom and certain markets in asia.  we approach distribution strategically by brand, as each is at a different stage of development. we seek to optimize distribution in both channels and geographies, matching each brand with appropriate opportunities.  we focus on those areas where we believe our brands will expand consumer coverage and gain high-quality distribution consistent with their positioning.  as part of this strategy, we continue to expand brands in our travel retail channel, which benefits from increasing international passenger traffic.  travel retail continues to be an important channel for brand building and profit margin expansion, although it is susceptible to a number of external factors, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and consumers willingness and ability to travel and spend.  we have strategies focused on consumers who purchase in the travel retail channel, in stores at their travel destinations or when they return to their home market.  this includes partnering with our retailers to open individual boutiques within airports to compete more effectively in this channel.  we are broadening our online portfolio around the world by adding brands to existing markets and entering new markets, resulting in strong net sales growth in the online channel, and we continue to develop and test omnichannel concepts to better serve consumers as they shop across channels.  we have identified opportunities to expand our online portfolio around the world, which we expect will result in continued net sales growth in this channel. our success in delivering particularly strong online growth in emerging markets is a result of taking key learnings from our online strategy in established markets, such as the united states, the united kingdom and germany, and customizing them to meet local market needs.  to further drive our online sales, we are planning new e- and m-commerce site launches in new and existing markets, and we are extending our third-party platform model, which has been successful in china, into certain other international locations.
while our business is performing well overall, we are faced with strong competition globally and economic challenges in certain countries. in particular, we are cautious of the continued slow retail growth in hong kong, the decline in retail traffic primarily related to mid-tier department stores, as well as certain mac freestanding stores, in the united states as a result of the impact of shifts in preferences of certain consumers as to where and how they shop for our products.  we are also cautious of the continued strength of the u.s. dollar in relation to most currencies.  additionally, we are continuing to monitor the effects of the macroeconomic environment in brazil, the united kingdoms anticipated exit from the european union, the political instability in turkey, the impact of declining oil prices on consumer purchases in the middle east, and global security issues.

we believe we can, to some extent, offset the impact of these challenges by accelerating areas of strength, utilizing the various growth drivers among our brands, channels and markets.  however, if economic conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen, or the adverse conditions previously discussed are further prolonged, then there could be a negative effect on ongoing consumer confidence, demand and spending and, as a result, on our business.  we will continue to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business.
we navigate through short-term volatility while focusing on our long-term strategy and using our multiple engines of growth that we believe will promote sustainable growth.  we are increasing our presence in emerging markets, continuing efforts to revitalize and accelerate growth in our heritage brands, focusing on key demographics and seeking opportunities to add to our diverse brand portfolio.  we are also strengthening our consumer engagement by leveraging digital marketing and enhancing our social media strategies and execution.  we will continue to drive product, packaging, and conceptual innovation and creativity that we believe will enable us to introduce products that resonate with consumers.  some initiatives will involve new sub-categories and others may expand key franchises.  we expect to leverage our top line growth through greater productivity, due in part to cost savings and efficiencies from our strategic modernization initiative (smi).
on may 3, 2016, we announced a multi-year initiative (leading beauty forward) to build on our strengths and better leverage our cost structure to free resources for investment to continue our growth momentum.  leading beauty forward is designed to enhance our go-to-market capabilities, reinforce our leadership in global prestige beauty and continue creating sustainable value.  we plan to approve specific initiatives under leading beauty forward through fiscal 2019 and expect to complete those initiatives through fiscal 2021.  we expect that leading beauty forward will result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between $600 million and $700 million, before taxes, consisting of employee-related costs, asset write-offs and other costs to implement these initiatives.  after its full implementation, we expect leading beauty forward to yield annual net benefits, primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses, of between $200 million and $300 million, before taxes.  we expect to reinvest a portion behind future growth initiatives.  for additional information about leading beauty forward, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data  note 7  charges associated with restructuring activities.
in addition to leading beauty forward, investment in our global information systems is an ongoing process.  we have implemented initiatives to leverage our smi foundation that are focused on sustainment and global efficiencies.  as we modernize our key processes, related systems and infrastructure, we continue to develop upgraded capabilities to support our human resource operations and are making investments to upgrade our global technology infrastructure (gti), as well as our retail systems and retail capabilities globally.  these initiatives are expected to improve profitability by enhancing gross margin and supporting efficiencies in select operating expenses and working capital, freeing resources to strategically reinvest in activities to support our future growth.
in october 2015, we approved plans to transform and modernize our gti to fundamentally change the way we deliver information technology services internally (such initiative, the gti restructuring).  as part of the gti restructuring, we transitioned our gti from company-owned assets to a primarily vendor-owned, cloud-based model where we pay for services as they are used.  this model, with a different third-party provider, is expected to provide an enhanced scalable platform to better support current and future requirements, help us achieve key strategic opportunities and improve our agility and flexibility to respond to the demands of the business by leveraging more advanced technologies.  this transition is expected to result in operational efficiencies and reduce our information technology service and infrastructure costs in the future.  the implementation of the gti restructuring was substantially completed during fiscal 2016.  net savings from this initiative may be partially reinvested in other strategic areas of our business.  for additional information about the gti restructuring initiative, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data  note 7  charges associated with restructuring activities.

we rolled out the last major wave of smi in july 2014, and most of our locations are now sap-enabled.  we plan to continue the implementation of sap at our remaining locations throughout the next few fiscal years.  in connection with the july 2014 implementation, some retailers accelerated their sales orders that would have occurred in our fiscal 2015 first quarter into our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter in advance of this implementation to provide adequate safety stock to mitigate any potential short-term business interruption associated with the smi rollout.  the negative impact on the net sales and operating results for the year ended june 30, 2015 by product category and geographic region was as follows:

the lower orders during the year ended june 30, 2015 created a favorable comparison between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 of approximately $178 million in net sales and approximately $127 million in operating results and impacted our operating margin comparisons.  we believe that the presentation of certain year-to-date comparative information in the following discussions that excludes the impact of the timing of these orders is useful in analyzing the net sales performance and operating results of our business.

reported net sales in fiscal 2016 grew in each product category, with the exception of skin care, and in each geographic region, with the exception of asia/pacific.  the overall decline in the skin care category was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and the relatively slow growth in global prestige skin care that particularly impacted net sales in north america, asia/pacific and travel retail.  however, this category benefited from increased sales of certain products, particularly from la mer and origins.  net sales increases in product offerings by mac, smashbox, tom ford, clinique, bobbi brown and estée lauder globally drove the growth in the makeup category.  our fragrance category benefited from net sales increases from our luxury brands.  incremental sales from our acquisitions during the past two years also helped drive our skin care and fragrance sales.  the net sales increase in our hair care category was driven by product offerings from aveda and bumble and bumble, as well as expanded consumer coverage.  each of our product categories benefited from brand expansion, comparable door sales growth from certain brands, new product offerings and growth from emerging markets.

net sales in fiscal 2015 decreased from fiscal 2014, entirely driven by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $519 million and the difficult comparison due to the accelerated orders, as discussed above, of approximately $357 million.  inclusive of these items, higher net sales in our makeup and hair care product categories were more than offset by declines in our skin care and fragrance product categories, while geographically, we experienced lower net sales in each region.  our makeup artist and luxury brands continued to grow net sales through successful product launches and the broadening of their presence globally.  however, net sales from estée lauder and clinique were challenged in all of our product categories and reflected a difficult comparison to fiscal 2014, which featured significant launch activity related to the reformulation of certain iconic skin care products and several significant fragrance launches.  in addition, we experienced strong growth in certain channels such as specialty-multi, online and freestanding stores, as well as expansion in emerging markets.  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders, net sales would have increased in each of our major product categories and within each geographic region.
returns associated with restructuring activities are not allocated to our product categories or geographic regions because they result from activities that are deemed a company-wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select corporate functions and go-to-market structures.  accordingly, the following discussions of net sales by product categories and geographic regions exclude the fiscal 2016 impact of returns associated with restructuring activities of $1.4 million.

skin care net sales decreased in fiscal 2016, reflecting approximately $163 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by the favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders of approximately $91 million.  the reported net sales decrease reflected lower net sales from estée lauder and clinique of approximately $138 million, combined. the decrease in net sales of estée lauder and clinique products was due, in part, to lower sales in certain countries within asia/pacific, particularly hong kong reflecting continued retail softness.  the lower net sales from clinique also reflected decreased sales in travel retail. these decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of la mer and origins products, as well as incremental sales from our fiscal 2015 acquisitions of glamglow and rodin olio lusso, of approximately $108 million, combined.   net sales of la mer products grew in all regions, driven by the continued momentum of the fiscal 2016 launches of the renewal oil, the lifting eye serum and genaissance de la mer the serum essence and an increase in distribution in specialty-multi brand retailers and department stores.  net sales growth of origins products benefited from higher sales of facial mask products.
skin care net sales decreased in fiscal 2015, reflecting the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $215 million. the decrease, as reported, reflected lower net sales of estée lauder and clinique products of approximately $303 million, combined, primarily due to the accelerated orders and significant launch activity in fiscal 2014 related to the reformulation of certain iconic products.  these decreases were partially offset by higher sales of la mer products, primarily due to fiscal 2015 launches and expanded distribution in the travel retail channel, and incremental sales from our fiscal 2015 acquisitions of approximately $23 million, combined.

makeup net sales increased in fiscal 2016 despite approximately $233 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. the increase was also impacted by the favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders of approximately $65 million.  the reported net sales increase primarily reflected higher net sales from our makeup artist brands, clinique, smashbox, tom ford and estée lauder of approximately $397 million, combined. sales from our makeup artist brands benefited from new product offerings, as well as the continued broadening of the brands presence in a number of channels, including our freestanding retail stores and travel retail.  the higher net sales from clinique reflected incremental sales from new launches such as clinique beyond perfecting makeup products.   sales from smashbox were primarily driven by specialty multi-brand retailers, reflecting the overall strength of the makeup category in that channel.  the increase in tom ford net sales was driven by higher sales of lip color products.  net sales of estée lauder products improved partially due to higher sales from the double wear line of products and the pure color envy franchise.
makeup net sales increased in fiscal 2015 and included the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $205 million.  the net sales increase, as reported, primarily reflected higher net sales from our makeup artist brands, tom ford and smashbox of approximately $293 million, combined.  sales from our makeup artist brands benefited from new product offerings, as well as expanded distribution in a number of channels, including our freestanding retail stores.  the higher net sales from tom ford and smashbox were primarily due to expanded distribution of tom ford in the travel retail channel and smashbox in specialty multi-brand retailers.  partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of clinique and estée lauder products of approximately $161 million, combined.

fragrance net sales increased in fiscal 2016 despite approximately $75 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.  this increase was also impacted by the favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders of approximately $21 million.  the reported net sales increase primarily reflected higher net sales of luxury fragrances from jo malone london and tom ford, as well as incremental sales from our fiscal 2015 acquisitions of le labo and editions de parfums frédéric malle and the fiscal 2016 acquisition of by kilian of approximately $134 million, combined.  the higher net sales from jo malone london were, in part, due to brand expansion in department stores, freestanding stores and travel retail, the recent launch of mimosa & cardamom, and increased sales of existing products.  the increase in tom ford net sales reflected incremental sales from new product launches, including tom ford noir pour femme and increased distribution, particularly in travel retail. partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of certain fragrances from our heritage brands and certain designer fragrances of approximately $62 million, combined.

hair care net sales increased in fiscal 2016 despite the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $14 million.  the increase in net sales reflected new product launches from aveda, such as invati men and shampure dry shampoo and, to a lesser extent, an increase in distribution of aveda products in salons and travel retail and bumble and bumble products in specialty multi-brand retailers.
hair care net sales increased in fiscal 2015 and included the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $22 million.  the increase in net sales reflected expanded global distribution of aveda products in department stores, freestanding retail stores, salons and in the travel retail channel, and bumble and bumble products in specialty multi-brand retailers.  the category also benefited from increased sales of smooth infusion naturally straight from aveda, as well as the expansion of the hairdressers invisible oil line of products from bumble and bumble which contributed approximately $12 million to the increase, combined.  partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of the invati line of products and dry remedy moisturizing shampoo from aveda of approximately $6 million, combined.

net sales in the americas increased in fiscal 2016 despite the negative impact of approximately $101 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.  net sales in the united states and canada increased approximately $191 million, combined, and reflected the favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders of approximately $84 million.  the increase also reflected higher makeup net sales, driven by clinique, smashbox, estée lauder and mac, as well as higher skin care and hair care net sales from la mer and aveda, respectively. also contributing were higher fragrance net sales from tom ford and jo malone london, which were more than offset by lower net sales of estée lauder fragrances.  net sales were impacted by a decline in retail traffic in the united states related primarily to mid-tier department stores that principally affected estée lauder and clinique, as well as certain mac freestanding stores, as a result of a decrease in tourism, particularly from brazilian travelers.  net sales in latin america increased approximately $6 million, primarily reflecting higher net sales in mexico and argentina, partially offset by lower sales in brazil as a result of unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately $33 million.  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, the emerging markets of brazil and mexico had net sales increases of approximately $56 million, primarily driven by mac.
net sales in the americas decreased in fiscal 2015.  net sales in the united states and canada decreased by approximately $53 million, combined, primarily due to lower net sales from certain of our heritage brands, driven by the impact of the accelerated orders and a difficult comparison with fiscal 2014, which featured significant launch activity related to the reformulation of certain iconic products.  these decreases were partially offset by higher net sales from our makeup artist, luxury and hair care brands.  net sales in latin america decreased approximately $5 million, primarily reflecting lower net sales in venezuela, partially offset by higher net sales in brazil.

net sales in europe, the middle east & africa increased in fiscal 2016.  this increase includes approximately $265 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation due to the strength of the u.s. dollar in relation to all currencies in the region. the increase was also impacted by the favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders of approximately $68 million.  higher sales in our travel retail business, the united kingdom and the middle east totaled approximately $225 million, combined.  the sales growth in our travel retail business was partially driven by the favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders.  travel retail growth also reflected higher net sales from jo malone london, tom ford, mac and smashbox, driven in part by increased distribution and new product offerings.  higher sales in the united kingdom and the middle east were primarily due to increased net sales from estée lauder, our makeup artist brands and smashbox, reflecting the strength of our makeup category, as well as higher sales from certain of our luxury brands.  these increases were partially offset by lower net sales in russia and south africa of approximately $17 million, combined, driven by the negative impact of foreign currency translation.  excluding this impact, net sales in russia and south africa increased $57 million, combined. the sales growth in russia was primarily due to higher net sales from certain of our heritage and luxury brands. the higher net sales in south africa were primarily driven by our makeup artist brands and certain of our luxury brands, reflecting successful in-store promotional events.

fiscal 2016 as compared with fiscal 2015
the lower advertising, merchandising and sampling costs in fiscal 2016, as a percentage of net sales, as compared to fiscal 2015, were in part due to the brand and channel mix of our spend as certain media formats carry different cost structures.  certain of our brands have lower costs associated with advertising as they focus on digital and social media strategies and rely less on print and television advertising, which carry a higher media cost.
adjusting for the impact of the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders, operating expense margin in fiscal 2016 would have increased an additional 90 basis points, to 160 basis points unfavorable as compared to fiscal 2015.  this additional increase, as a percentage of net sales, was reflected in general and administrative, selling and shipping, and advertising, merchandising and sampling costs.
fiscal 2015 as compared with fiscal 2014
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was a result of higher support spending behind capability-building initiatives, such as information technology, as well as for acquisition-related expenses.  the higher store operating and selling costs in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 were primarily driven by the expansion of mac and jo malone london freestanding retail stores.
in fiscal 2015, adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders into the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales would have increased approximately 10 basis points, primarily reflecting an increase in general and administrative expenses and higher store operating costs, partially offset by lower spending on advertising, merchandising and sampling and lower charges related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets in venezuela.
changes in advertising, merchandising and sampling spending result from the type, timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets and brands being emphasized.

the overall operating results and operating margin in fiscal 2016 were impacted by a favorable comparison of approximately $127 million related to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders, more than offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately $134 million, which negatively impacted each product category and geographic region.  in addition, the operating results for fiscal 2016 include the impact of charges associated with restructuring activities of $134.7 million.  adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders and charges associated with restructuring activities, operating income would have increased 1% and operating margin would have decreased 30 basis points.
in fiscal 2015, operating margin decreased reflecting an increase in our operating expense margin, partially offset by our higher gross margin.  our skin care, makeup and fragrance results declined, primarily reflecting the accelerated orders, as well as certain challenges and difficult comparisons affecting our net sales growth in certain markets and channels by our heritage brands as previously discussed.  these decreases were partially offset by improved results from our makeup artist, certain luxury, and our hair care brands.  while certain operating expenses have increased as a percentage of net sales during fiscal 2015, we were able to implement cost containment measures to mitigate the impact.
charges associated with restructuring activities are not allocated to our product categories or geographic regions because they result from activities that are deemed a company-wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select corporate functions and go-to-market structures and to transform and modernize the companys gti.  accordingly, the following discussions of operating income by product categories and geographic regions exclude the fiscal 2016 impact of charges associated with restructuring activities of $134.7 million, or 1% of net sales.

operating income in the americas increased in fiscal 2016, reflecting the favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders.  excluding the impact of the accelerated orders, operating income decreased, primarily reflecting an increase in advertising, merchandising and sampling expenses related to mac in-store promotional events and certain of our luxury brands, as well as higher store operating and selling costs as a result of increased distribution.  operating income was impacted by a decline in retail traffic in the united states related primarily to mid-tier department stores that primarily affected estée lauder and clinique, as well as certain mac freestanding stores, as a result of a decrease in tourism, particularly from brazilian travelers.

operating income in the americas decreased in fiscal 2015, primarily reflecting the decrease in net sales from our heritage brands in the united states and canada associated with the accelerated orders and the significant launch activity in fiscal 2014 related to the reformulation of certain iconic products, as well as higher general and administrative expenses, which include acquisition-related expenses.  this decrease was partially offset by lower advertising, merchandising and sampling spending by our heritage brands due to the lower launch activity and a reallocation of spending among media formats.  the region also benefited from higher results in latin america, primarily driven by lower charges related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets in venezuela.

in europe, the middle east & africa, operating income increased in fiscal 2016, primarily reflecting higher results from our travel retail business, which benefited mostly from the accelerated orders, germany and the middle east of approximately $92 million, combined.  the higher results in germany were due to increased sales from certain of our heritage brands and our makeup artist brands, primarily due to new product introductions, as well as more effective promotional programs.  these higher results were partially offset by lower results in the united kingdom, france and russia of approximately $33 million.  the lower results in the united kingdom were driven by the negative impact of foreign currency.  the lower results in france were partially due to higher investment spending behind certain of our heritage and luxury brands.
operating income in europe, the middle east & africa increased in fiscal 2015.  higher operating results in the united kingdom, the middle east, france, india, russia and switzerland of approximately $83 million, combined, were partially offset by lower operating results in our travel retail business, due to the accelerated orders, and, to a lesser extent, germany of approximately $79 million, combined.  the higher results in france, india, russia and switzerland were primarily due to an increase in constant currency net sales.

basis-point change from prior year        (200   )     (210   )
the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 was principally attributable to a lower effective tax rate related to our foreign operations, as well as a decrease in income tax reserve adjustments recorded in the current year.
the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 was principally attributable to a lower effective tax rate related to our foreign operations, which included venezuela remeasurement charges in fiscal 2015 and 2014 of $5.3 million and $38.3 million, respectively, for which no tax benefit was provided. this reduction was partially offset by an increase in income tax reserve adjustments recorded in fiscal 2015.
the provision for income taxes represents u.s. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes.  the effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments, which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.  our effective tax rate will change from quarter to quarter based on recurring and non-recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stock-based compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies.  in addition, changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the quarter of change.

reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures we use certain non-gaap financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business.  management believes that excluding these items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between two periods.  while we consider the non-gaap measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap.  the following tables present net sales, operating income and diluted net earnings per common share adjusted to exclude the impact of accelerated orders associated with the july 2014 smi rollout (i.e. the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders), charges associated with restructuring activities, the fiscal 2015 venezuela remeasurement charge and the effects of foreign currency translation.  the tables provide reconciliations between these non-gaap financial measures and the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measures.

financial condition liquidity and capital resources overview our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations, borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program, borrowings from the issuance of long-term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the united states and abroad.  at june 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $914.1 million compared with $1,021.4 million at june 30, 2015.  our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions.  to mitigate the risk of uninsured balances, we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and we perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure.
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents from the prior year primarily reflects cash used to purchase short- and long-term investments pursuant to our cash investment strategy.  our investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, asset diversification, and achieving appropriate returns within the guidelines set forth in our investment policy.  these investments are classified as available-for-sale and totaled $1,504.5 million and $917.8 million at june 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
our business is seasonal in nature and, accordingly, our working capital needs vary.  from time to time, we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding.  to the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations, we could, subject to market conditions, issue commercial paper, issue long-term debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities.
based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations, information systems enhancements, capital expenditures, potential stock repurchases, restructuring activities, commitments and other contractual obligations on both a near-term and long-term basis. our cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investment balances at june 30, 2016 include approximately $2,002 million of cash and short- and long-term investments in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy.  we do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds offshore impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations.  if these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the united states as dividends, we would be subject to additional taxes.
the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years.  generally, we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices, increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases, which have been moderate.

credit ratings changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs.  our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility as discussed below.  downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper and/or long-term debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing.  a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  as of august 18, 2016, our commercial paper is rated a-1 by standard & poors and p-1 by moodys and our long-term debt is rated a+ with a stable outlook by standard & poors and a2 with a stable outlook by moodys.
debt and access to liquidity total debt as a percent of total capitalization (excluding noncontrolling interests) increased to 39% at june 30, 2016 from 31% at june 30, 2015, primarily due to the issuance of the $450.0 million of 1.70% senior notes due may 2021 (2021 senior notes) and an additional $150.0 million of our 4.375% senior notes due june 2045 (2045 senior notes).

the fiscal 2016 decrease in net cash provided by operating activities as compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily driven by the accelerated orders in connection with our july 2014 smi implementation, which contributed to an unfavorable comparison in certain working capital components and the increase in net earnings.  the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities also reflected an unfavorable change in accounts receivable, reflecting the timing of shipments and collections, and higher long-term payments related to new freestanding retail store locations, including cash payments made to former tenants to acquire the rights under commercial property leases.  also contributing to the decrease was an unfavorable change in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of expenses.  these decreases were partially offset by an increase in other accrued liabilities, due, in part, to higher accrued restructuring costs and employee incentive compensation.
the fiscal 2015 increase in net cash provided by operating activities as compared with fiscal 2014 primarily reflected a favorable change in accounts receivable, reflecting the timing of shipments and improved collections, a favorable change in inventory, reflecting our initiative to better align supply levels with forecasted demand and other supply chain improvements, and a favorable change in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of payments. the accelerated orders in connection with our july 2014 smi implementation also contributed to the favorable changes in these working capital components and the decrease in net earnings as compared to fiscal 2014.
the fiscal 2016 decrease in net cash used for investing activities as compared with fiscal 2015 primarily reflected lower net purchases of investments in connection with our cash investment strategy.  the decrease in cash used for investing activities also reflected lower payments related to acquisitions.  cash paid in connection with the fiscal 2015 acquisitions was partially offset by cash paid in connection with the fiscal 2016 acquisition of by kilian and an additional purchase price true-up payment related to a fiscal 2015 acquisition.  partially offsetting the decrease was cash paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 for the long-term investment in have & be co. ltd., the company behind the skin care brands dr. jart + and do the right thing, as well as higher capital expenditure activity, primarily related to leasehold improvements.
the fiscal 2015 increase in net cash used for investing activities as compared with fiscal 2014 primarily reflected purchases of investments in connection with the implementation of our cash investment strategy, as previously discussed.  also contributing to the increase was cash paid in connection with the acquisitions of rodin olio lusso, le labo, editions de parfums frédéric malle and glamglow.  partially offsetting cash used for investing activities were proceeds from the disposition of investments and, to a lesser extent, lower capital expenditure activity.
the fiscal 2016 decrease in net cash used for financing activities as compared with fiscal 2015 primarily reflected the proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 senior notes and additional 2045 senior notes, as well as lower treasury stock purchases, partially offset by higher dividend payments.

dividends for a summary of quarterly cash dividends declared per share on our class a and class b common stock during the year ended june 30, 2016 and through august 18, 2016, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data  note 15  common stock.
pension and post-retirement plan funding several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans.  for the u.s. qualified plan, we seek to maintain appropriate funded percentages.  for any future contributions to the u.s. qualified plan, we would seek to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended, (erisa) and subsequent pension legislation, and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.  for each international plan, our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations.  in addition, amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting policies and estimates.  the effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of participants electing to take lump-sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions.
for the u.s. qualified plan, we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities.  this strategy assists us in maintaining our overall funded ratio.  during fiscal 2016, we made a cash contribution to the u.s. qualified plan of $30.0 million.  for fiscal 2016 and 2015, we met or exceeded all contribution requirements under erisa regulations for the u.s. qualified plan.  as we continue to monitor the funded status, we may decide to make cash contributions to the u.s. qualified plan or our post-retirement medical plan in the united states during fiscal 2017.
the following table summarizes actual and expected benefit payments and contributions for our other pension and post-retirement plans:

non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan benefit payments             $17.1          $8.6          $4.9
international defined benefit pension plan contributions                         $22.4         $21.8         $22.8

commitments and contingencies certain of our business acquisition agreements include contingent consideration or earn-out provisions.  these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business.  since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business, we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition.

market risk we use a value-at-risk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments.  value-at-risk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level.  we estimate value-at-risk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250-day period.  the high, low and average measured value-at-risk during fiscal 2016 and 2015 related to our derivative financial instruments is as follows:
june 30, 2016                                june 30, 2015

(in millions)                    high            low           average         high          low           average foreign exchange contracts       $160.7          $15.4         $54.2           $28.6         $7.4          $17.8
interest rate contracts      16.1            9.2           12.7            16.1          16.1          16.1
the model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level.  we used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths.
our calculated value-at-risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur.  it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year.  value-at-risk during fiscal 2016 was higher than fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher volatility in foreign exchange rates.  we believe, however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities, other than operating leases, that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.
recently issued accounting standards refer to item 8. financial statements and supplementary data  note 2  summary of significant accounting policies for discussion regarding the impact of accounting standards that were recently issued but not yet effective, on our consolidated financial statements.
cautionary note regarding forward-looking information we and our representatives from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in this and other filings with the securities and exchange commission, in our press releases and in our reports to stockholders.  the words and phrases will likely result, expect, believe, planned, may, should, could, anticipate, estimate, project, intend, forecast or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.  these statements include, our expectations regarding sales, earnings or other future financial performance and liquidity, product introductions, entry into new geographic regions, information systems initiatives, new methods of sale, our long-term strategy, restructuring and other charges and resulting cost savings, and future operations or operating results.  although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, actual results may differ materially from our expectations.  factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include:
(1) increased competitive activity from companies in the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care businesses;
(2) our ability to develop, produce and market new products on which future operating results may depend and to successfully address challenges in our business;
(3) consolidations, restructurings, bankruptcies and reorganizations in the retail industry causing a decrease in the number of stores that sell our products, an increase in the ownership concentration within the retail industry, ownership of retailers by our competitors or ownership of competitors by our customers that are retailers and our inability to collect receivables;
(4) destocking and tighter working capital management by retailers;
- 48 -
(5) the success, or changes in timing or scope, of new product launches and the success, or changes in the timing or the scope, of advertising, sampling and merchandising programs;
(6) shifts in the preferences of consumers as to where and how they shop for the types of products and services we sell;
(7) social, political and economic risks to our foreign or domestic manufacturing, distribution and retail operations, including changes in foreign investment and trade policies and regulations of the host countries and of the united states;
(8) changes in the laws, regulations and policies (including the interpretations and enforcement thereof) that affect, or will affect, our business, including those relating to our products or distribution networks, changes in accounting standards, tax laws and regulations, environmental or climate change laws, regulations or accords, trade rules and customs regulations, and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings, and any action we may take as a result;
(9) foreign currency fluctuations affecting our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets, the relative prices at which we and our foreign competitors sell products in the same markets and our operating and manufacturing costs outside of the united states;
(10) changes in global or local conditions, including those due to the volatility in the global credit and equity markets, natural or man-made disasters, real or perceived epidemics, or energy costs, that could affect consumer purchasing, the willingness or ability of consumers to travel and/or purchase our products while traveling, the financial strength of our customers, suppliers or other contract counterparties, our operations, the cost and availability of capital which we may need for new equipment, facilities or acquisitions, the returns that we are able to generate on our pension assets and the resulting impact on funding obligations, the cost and availability of raw materials and the assumptions underlying our critical accounting estimates;
(11) shipment delays, commodity pricing, depletion of inventory and increased production costs resulting from disruptions of operations at any of the facilities that manufacture nearly all of our supply of a particular type of product (i.e. focus factories) or at our distribution or inventory centers, including disruptions that may be caused by the implementation of information technology initiatives, or by restructurings;
(12) real estate rates and availability, which may affect our ability to increase or maintain the number of retail locations at which we sell our products and the costs associated with our other facilities;
(13) changes in product mix to products which are less profitable;
(14) our ability to acquire, develop or implement new information and distribution technologies and initiatives on a timely basis and within our cost estimates and our ability to maintain continuous operations of such systems and the security of data and other information that may be stored in such systems or other systems or media;
(15) our ability to capitalize on opportunities for improved efficiency, such as publicly-announced strategies and restructuring and cost-savings initiatives, and to integrate acquired businesses and realize value therefrom;
(16) consequences attributable to local or international conflicts around the world, as well as from any terrorist action, retaliation and the threat of further action or retaliation;
(17) the timing and impact of acquisitions, investments and divestitures; and
(18) additional factors as described in our filings with the securities and exchange commission, including this annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016.
we assume no responsibility to update forward-looking statements made herein or otherwise.

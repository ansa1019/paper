item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global provider of medical technology products that enhance clinical benefits, improve patient and provider safety and reduce total procedural costs. we primarily design, develop, manufacture and supply single-use medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications. we market and sell our products worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors. because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures, we are not dependent upon any one end-market or procedure. we are focused on achieving consistent, sustainable and profitable growth by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies.
we evaluate our portfolio of products and businesses on an ongoing basis to ensure alignment with our overall objectives. based on our evaluation, we may identify opportunities to expand our margins through strategic divestitures of existing businesses and product lines that do not meet our objectives. in addition, we may seek to optimize utilization of our facilities through restructuring initiatives designed to further reduce our cost base and enhance our competitive position. for a discussion of our ongoing restructuring programs, see "restructuring and other impairment charges" under "results of operations" below. finally, we may continue to explore opportunities to expand the size of our business and improve our margins through a combination of acquisitions and distributor to direct sales conversions, which generally involves eliminating a distributor from the sales channel, thereby enabling us to obtain improved product pricing and more direct access to the end users of our products within the sales channel.
during 2016, we completed acquisitions of businesses that complement our oem and asia reportable operating segments. in addition, during this period, we acquired the remaining 26% ownership interest in an indian affiliate, teleflex medical private limited, from the noncontrolling shareholders. the total fair value of the consideration for these transactions was $22.8 million.
during 2015, we completed several acquisitions of businesses that complement the anesthesia, surgical ligation, vascular and oem product portfolios, as well as several acquisitions of distributors of medical devices and supplies. the total fair value of consideration for these acquisitions was $96.5 million.
on february 17, 2017, the company acquired all of the common stock and voting equity interest in vascular solutions, inc. ("vascular solutions") for $56.00 per share in cash, or a total of approximately $1.0 billion. vascular solutions is a medical device company that focuses on developing clinical solutions for minimally invasive coronary and peripheral vascular procedures. the acquisition is expected to meaningfully accelerate the growth of our vascular and interventional access product portfolios through increased revenue associated with entry into the coronary and peripheral vascular market, as well as increased cross-portfolio selling opportunities to both our and vascular solutions' customer bases.
health care reform in 2010, the patient protection and affordable care act (as amended, the "affordable care act") was signed into law. the legislation is far-reaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality and reduce the costs of healthcare. for medical device companies such as teleflex, the expansion of medical insurance coverage should lead to greater utilization of the products we manufacture, but the provisions of the legislation designed to contain the cost of healthcare could negatively affect pricing of our products and encourage patient outcome driven results. the overall impact of the affordable care act on our business is yet to be determined, mainly due to uncertainties around future customer behaviors, which we believe will be affected by reimbursement factors such as insurance coverage, statistics, patient outcomes and patient satisfaction. moreover, in light of the expressed intent of president trump and several members of congressional leadership to repeal the affordable care act and adopt a form of replacement legislation, the continued viability of, or the nature of any modification of, or legislative substitution for, the affordable care act, as well as the effect of any of these events, if they occur, is highly uncertain.
the affordable care act imposed a 2.3% excise tax on sales of medical devices, beginning in 2013. although the excise tax has been suspended for 2016 and 2017, its status remains unclear for 2018 and subsequent years. for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded medical device excise taxes of $10.2 million and $12.7 million, respectively, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

global economic conditions global economic conditions in recent years have had adverse impacts on market activities due to, among other things, failure of financial institutions, falling asset values, diminished liquidity, reduced demand for products and services and significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. in response, we adjusted production levels and engaged in new restructuring activities. we continue to review and evaluate our manufacturing, warehousing and distribution processes to maximize efficiencies through the elimination of redundancies in our operations and the consolidation of facilities. although, on a consolidated basis, the consequences of economic conditions, other than fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, have not had a significant adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, healthcare policies and practice trends vary by country, and the impact of the global economic downturn was felt to varying degrees in each of our regional markets over the last several years. the continuation of the present broadly applicable economic trends of weak economic growth, constricted credit, public sector austerity measures in response to public budget deficits and foreign currency volatility, particularly with respect to the euro, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our liquidity.
in recent years, hospitals in some regions of the united states experienced a decline in admissions, a weaker payor mix, and a reduction in elective procedures.  consequently, hospitals took actions to reduce their costs, including limiting their capital spending. more recently, the economic environment has improved somewhat, but has not returned to pre-recession levels, and challenges persist, particularly in some european countries, as discussed below. approximately 94% of our net revenues come from single-use products primarily used in critical care and surgical applications, and our sales volume could be negatively impacted if hospital admission rates or payor mix change. conversely, our sales volume could be positively impacted due to increases in the number of insured individuals as a result of the affordable care act, which has had the effect of facilitating medical insurance coverage for many persons who previously were not covered, although, as noted above, the affordable care act may be subject to repeal, modification or replacement.
a number of european countries continue to contend with considerable government debt, annual deficits and high levels of unemployment. despite some indications of a more positive economic outlook in europe, the healthcare sector remains weak. in particular, budgetary restraints among european countries have led to cost control measures, such as delays in approvals for elective surgeries.the public healthcare systems in certain countries in western europe, most notably greece, spain, portugal and italy, have experienced significantly reduced liquidity due to recessionary conditions, which continues to result in delays in payments to us by customers in these countries. moreover, the impact of brexit, economic and trade policies of the trump administration and the results of several 2017 elections in european nations, including germany and france, are uncertain and could have a profound economic effect in europe and elsewhere.
in asia, governments have intensified efforts to manage the cost of healthcare in response to an uncertain economic environment that has resulted in moderate growth rates across the region. we are experiencing an increasing trend of government-driven price management and reimbursement controls, particularly in china, japan and indonesia. there also has been an increase in government initiatives to help local manufacturers access a bigger share of the local market. moreover, many countries in the region have become more proactive with respect to regulatory requirements, and as a result, we expect longer, costlier and more complicated regulatory approval processes in these countries.
in latin america, some highly regulated economies such as argentina and venezuela have experienced unusually high inflation rates and weakening currencies. this has impacted the budgets of the public healthcare systems resulting in delays in the importation of medical devices. although latin america does not represent a significant portion of our business, our operations in this region may be adversely affected by these factors.
results of operations as used in this discussion, "new products" are products that we have sold for 36 months or less, and "existing products" are products that we have sold for more than 36 months. discussion of results of operations items that reference the effect of one or more acquired businesses (except as noted below with respect to acquired distributors) generally reflects the impact of the acquisitions within the first 12 months following the date of the acquisition. in addition to increases and decreases in the per unit selling prices of our products to our customers, our discussion of the impact of product price increases and decreases also reflects, for the first 12 months following the acquisition of a distributor, the impact on the pricing of our products resulting from the elimination of the distributor from the sales channel. to the extent an acquired distributor had pre-acquisition sales of products other than ours, the impact of the post-acquisition
36
sales of those products on our results of operations is included within our discussion of the impact of acquired businesses.
certain financial information is presented on a rounded basis, which may cause minor differences.
revenues
2016                             2015                  2014
(dollars in millions)
net revenues      $1,868.0              $1,809.7              $1,839.8
comparison of 2016 and 2015
net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 increased 3.2%, or $58.3 million, compared to the prior year. the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in sales volumes of existing products of $37.3 million and an increase in new product sales of $24.2 million, both across all of our segments. the increase was partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
comparison of 2015 and 2014
net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015 decreased 1.6%, or $30.1 million, compared to the prior year. the decrease is primarily attributable to unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of $129.1 million, primarily in the emea and asia segments. the decrease in net revenues was partially offset by a net increase in sales volumes of existing products in most of our segments of $51.9 million, and a net increase in new product sales in most of our segments of $19.4 million. in addition, the decrease was further offset by sales by acquired businesses, primarily human medics co., ltd. ("human medics"), a distributor of medical devices and supplies primarily in the korean market, mini-lap, a developer of micro-laparoscopic instrumentation, mayo healthcare pty limited, ("mayo healthcare"), a distributor of medical devices and supplies, primarily in the australian market, n. stenning & co. pty. ltd. ("stenning"), a distributor of medical devices and supplies primarily in the australian market, and truphatek holdings (1993) limited ("truphatek"), a manufacturer of a broad range of disposable and reusable laryngoscope devices, which generated $14.8 million, and net price increases, primarily in the asia and surgical north america segments, which generated $12.8 million.

comparison of 2016 and 2015
for the year ended december 31, 2016, gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased 110 basis points, or 2.1%, compared to the prior year. the increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to the impact of an increase in sales of higher margin products, primarily in the anesthesia north america and emea segments, as well as lower manufacturing costs resulting from cost improvement initiatives, including the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan.
comparison of 2015 and 2014
for the year ended december 31, 2015, gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased 100 basis points, or 2.0%, compared to the prior year. the increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to the 70 basis point impact of a net increase in sales of higher margin products, primarily in the surgical north america and oem segments, the 60 basis point impact of a net increase in sales volumes of existing products, primarily in the vascular north america, emea and asia segments and the 30 basis point impact of net price increases, primarily in the asia and surgical north america segments. gross margin was negatively impacted by the 80 basis point impact of net unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and costs associated with product recalls and quality issues first identified during the second quarter 2015 partially offset by lower manufacturing costs resulting from cost improvement initiatives.

comparison of 2016 and 2015
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $5.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the prior year. the decrease is primarily attributable to the favorable impact of the suspension of the excise tax on medical devices under the affordable care act of $10.2 million and the favorable impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchanges rates of $2.7 million, partially offset by an increase in selling and marketing expenses of $7.5 million.
comparison of 2015 and 2014
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $9.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the prior year. the decrease is due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of $28.5 million and a reduction in medical device excise tax of $2.5 million. these declines were partially offset by expenses associated with our 2015 acquisitions and distributor-to-direct sales conversions of $11.4 million, an increase in selling expenses of $5.4 million, primarily related to higher sales commissions, a reduction, as compared to 2014, in the benefit resulting from the reversal of contingent consideration liabilities of $2.9 million and higher amortization expense of $2.6 million.
research and development
2016                                                2015              2014

comparison of 2016 and 2015
the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to increased spending on new product development with respect to several of our segments.
comparison of 2015 and 2014
the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015 resulted from efficiencies realized through our integration of research and development projects commenced by certain businesses acquired in 2013 that were reflected in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014. the decrease is also attributable to the late stage technology acquisitions made in 2015, which supplement our organic research and development initiatives.

2016 restructuring charges for the year ended december 31, 2016, the restructuring charges primarily related to the 2016 manufacturing footprint realignment plan and, to a lesser extent, to other restructuring programs, which are described below. the restructuring charges recognized for the year ended december 31, 2016 included termination benefits and contract termination costs of $13.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively.
2016 manufacturing footprint realignment plan on february 23, 2016, our board of directors approved a restructuring plan involving the consolidation of operations and a related workforce reduction at certain of our facilities (the "2016 manufacturing footprint realignment plan"). we estimate that we will incur aggregate pre-tax charges in connection with these restructuring activities of approximately $34 million to $44 million, of which we estimate $27 million to $31 million will result in future cash outlays. additionally, we expect to incur aggregate capital expenditures of approximately $17 million to $19 million in connection with the 2016 manufacturing footprint realignment plan. we currently expect to achieve annualized savings of $12 million to $16 million once the plan is fully implemented and currently expect to realize plan-related savings beginning in 2017.
2016 other restructuring programs during 2016, we committed to certain actions designed to further improve operating efficiencies and reduce costs. these actions include the consolidation of global administrative functions and manufacturing operations. these programs commenced in the second half of 2016 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of 2018. we estimate that we will record aggregate pre-tax charges of $3.8 million to $4.7 million related to these programs, substantially all of which constitute termination benefits and lease termination costs that will result in future cash outlays. additionally, we expect to incur approximately $1.5 million of accelerated depreciation and other costs directly related to the programs, which will be recognized in cost of goods sold; we anticipate that approximately $0.6 million of this amount will result in future outlays. we expect to achieve annualized pre-tax savings of $6.9 million to $8.5 million once this program has been fully implemented and anticipate that we will begin realizing savings related to the programs in 2017.
2015 restructuring charges for the year ended december 31, 2015, the restructuring charges primarily related to restructuring programs that were initiated in conjunction with the reorganization of certain of our businesses and shared service center functions as well as the consolidation of certain of our facilities in north america. the restructuring charges recognized for the year ended december 31, 2015 included termination benefits and contract termination costs of $5.8 million and $1.4 million, respectively.
39
2014 restructuring charges for the year ended december 31, 2014, we recognized restructuring charges related to several programs including the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan, the 2014 european restructuring plan and other 2014 restructuring programs, which are described below. the restructuring charges recorded for the year ended december 31, 2014 included termination benefits and contract termination costs of $16.9 million and $3.3 million, respectively. the restructuring charges were partially offset by a net credit of $3.2 million resulting from the reversal of contract termination costs due to the favorable settlement of a terminated distributor agreement related to the lma restructuring program, which was initiated following our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of lma international n.v. (the "lma business") in 2012 to integrate the lma business into our other businesses.
2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan in april 2014, our board of directors approved a restructuring plan (the "2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan") involving the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at certain facilities, and the relocation of manufacturing operations from certain higher-cost locations to existing lower-cost locations. these actions commenced in the second quarter 2014 and were initially expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2017.
to date, we have completed the consolidation and relocation of a significant portion of the operations subject to the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan, and achieved annualized savings of $17 million at december 31, 2016 directly related to these actions. with respect to the remaining actions to be taken under the plan, we revised our savings, expense and timing estimates during the third quarter 2016 to reflect the impact of changes we have implemented with respect to medication delivery devices included in certain kits primarily sold by our vascular north america operating segment and, to a lesser extent, certain kits primarily sold by our anesthesia north america operating segment. as a result of these changes, we have reduced our estimate with respect to the overall annualized savings we expect to realize under the plan from our prior estimate of $28 million to $35 million to a range of $23 million to $27 million. we anticipate that this decrease in projected savings will be offset, in large part, by an expected increase in annual revenues resulting from improved pricing on the affected vascular kits directly related to the changes described above. we anticipate that this projected increase in annual revenues, taken together with the projected annualized savings we expect to realize under the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan, should enable us to improve our pre-tax income on an annualized basis by approximately $28 million to $33 million once the plan has been completed.
as a result of the changes described above, we also revised our estimates with respect to the charges we expect to incur in connection with the plan. specifically, we now estimate that we will incur $43 million to $48 million in aggregate pre-tax charges associated with the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan, compared to our prior estimate of approximately $37 million to $44 million. in addition, we expect cash outlays associated with the plan to be in the range of $33 million to $38 million, compared to our prior estimate of approximately $26 million to $31 million. we continue to expect to incur $24 million to $30 million in aggregate capital expenditures under the plan.
we currently expect that the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan will be substantially complete by the end of the first half of 2020 rather than the end of 2017, which we previously anticipated.
we currently are evaluating the feasibility of alternative measures designed to mitigate the loss of expected savings and accelerate the currently estimated timetable for completion of the plan.
2014 european restructuring plan in 2014, we committed to a restructuring plan, which impacts certain administrative functions in europe and involves the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at certain of our european facilities. we expect future restructuring charges, if any, to be nominal and we expect to complete this plan in 2017.
other 2014 restructuring programs in june 2014, we initiated programs to consolidate locations in australia and terminate certain european distributor agreements in an effort to reduce costs. we completed these programs in 2015.

other impairment charges ipr&d impairment charge in may 2012, we acquired semprus biosciences corp. ("semprus"), a biomedical research and development company that developed a polymer surface treatment technology intended to reduce thrombus-related complications. through 2016, we continued to engage in research and development activities designed to support an application for regulatory approval and achieve commercialization of the technology. however, upon considering the continuing challenges, remaining risks and uncertainties and significant additional resources required in connection with the development and commercialization of the technology, as well as the availability and advances made with respect to other technologies, during the fourth quarter of 2016, we determined it would not be commercially reasonable to continue our efforts to develop the semprus technology. as a result, we significantly reduced, and over the course of 2017 will discontinue, our research and development efforts with regard to the semprus technology. consequently, we recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of $41.0 million ($26.1 million after tax) for the year ended december 31, 2016.
long-lived asset impairment charges during the fourth quarter we recorded $2.4 million in impairment charges related to two properties, one of which was classified as a held for sale building asset.
there were no impairment charges for the years ended december 31, 2015 or 2014.

comparison of 2016 and 2015
the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the prior year was primarily due to the repurchase through exchange transactions with holders of our 3.875% convertible senior subordinated notes due 2017 (the "convertible notes") and conversions of the convertible notes, each of which is described in more detail in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k, resulting in lower average amounts of debt outstanding compared to the prior period. the decrease was also the result of a lower average interest rate due to our june 1, 2015 redemption of our 6.875% senior subordinated notes due 2019 (the "2019 notes"), which were replaced by borrowings under our revolving credit facility and subsequently by our issuance of 4.875% senior notes due 2026 (the "2026 notes"). both the revolving credit facility and the 2026 notes carry interest rates that are lower than the 2019 notes. the decrease in interest expense was partially offset by financing fees of $3.4 million incurred for the year ended december 31, 2016 to secure the bridge financing commitments, as described in more detail in "liquidity and capital resources" section below and note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
comparison of 2015 and 2014
the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the prior year reflects the benefit of the redemption, on june 1, 2015, of our 6.875% senior subordinated notes due 2019, which had a fixed interest rate. proceeds from our revolving credit facility, which bear a lower variable interest rate, were utilized to redeem the 2019 notes.

for the year ended december 31, 2016, we recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $19.3 million, of which, $16.3 million related to our repurchase of convertible notes through exchange transactions we entered into with certain holders of the convertible notes and $3.0 million related to the conversions of $44.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information.
on june 1, 2015, we prepaid the $250 million aggregate outstanding principal amount under the 2019 notes. in addition to our prepayment of principal, we paid to the holders of the 2019 notes an $8.6 million prepayment make-whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. we recognized the prepayment make-whole amount and a $1.9 million write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs as a loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31, 2015.

during the first quarter of 2017, we decided to eliminate a key distributor within our sales channel in china, that distributed our vascular access, interventional access and cardiac care products. as a result, we will be undertaking a distributor to direct sales conversion under which we will distribute these products through alternative third party sub-distributors. see item 1 "business - history and recent developments - distributor-to-direct sales conversions and restructuring programs" for further information regarding our distributor-to-direct sales conversions. we expect to experience a decline in our 2017 sales and operating profit in our asia segment as the former distributor liquidates its remaining inventory of our products and we implement our new structure to support these sales. while the effects of this initiative are very difficult to predict, we currently anticipate that our asia segment net revenues in 2017 as compared to 2016 will decline by $4 million to $8 million and asia segment operating profit in 2017 as compared to 2016 will decline by $6 million to $9 million.

liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. in addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include: capital expenditures, acquisitions, pension funding,
46
dividends, taxes, scheduled principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding indebtedness, adequacy of available bank lines of credit and access to capital markets.
we believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit and accounts receivable securitization facilities will enable us to fund our operating requirements, capital expenditures and debt obligations for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.
of our $543.8 million of cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2016, $527.5 million was held at foreign subsidiaries. we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which we can access those funds on a cost effective basis. we are not aware of any restrictions on repatriation of these funds and, subject to cash payment of additional united states income taxes or foreign withholding taxes, these funds could be repatriated, if necessary. any additional taxes could be offset, at least in part, by foreign tax credits. the amount of any taxes required to be paid, which could be significant, and the application of tax credits would be determined based on income tax laws in effect at the time of such repatriation. we do not expect any such repatriation to result in additional tax expense because taxes have been provided for on unremitted foreign earnings that we do not consider permanently reinvested.
we have not experienced significant payment defaults by our customers and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our anticipated operating needs. however, as discussed above in "global economic conditions", although there have been recent improvements in certain countries, global financial markets remain volatile and the global credit markets are constrained, which creates risk that our customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity. consequently, we continue to monitor our credit risk, particularly with respect to customers in greece, italy, portugal and spain, as well as consider other risk mitigation strategies. in january 2017, we sold $16.1 million of receivables payable from publicly funded hospitals in italy for $16.0 million.
as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, our net trade receivables from publicly funded hospitals in greece, italy, portugal and spain were $29.2 million and $37.4 million, respectively. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, net revenues from customers in these countries were approximately 7%, 7% and 8%, respectively, of total net revenues, and average days that current and long-term accounts receivable were outstanding were 182, 204 and 223 days, respectively. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, net current and long-term accounts receivable from these countries were approximately 19% and 24%, respectively, of our consolidated net current and long-term accounts receivable. if economic conditions in these countries deteriorate, we may experience significant credit losses related to the public hospital systems in these countries. moreover, if global economic conditions generally deteriorate, we may experience further delays in customer payments, reductions in our customers' purchases and higher credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in 2017 and future years. see "critical accounting policies and estimates" below for additional information regarding the critical accounting estimates related to our accounts receivable.
on february 17, 2017, we acquired vascular solutions for $1.0 billion in cash, which we financed through a combination of borrowings under our increased revolving credit facility and a new senior secured term loan facility, both of which were provided under our amended and restated credit agreement. see "financing arrangements" below for additional information regarding these facilities. however, in december 2016, concurrent with our entry into the agreement to acquire vascular solutions, we secured bridge financing commitments to ensure our ability to pay the purchase price for the vascular solutions acquisition and fees, costs and expenses related to the acquisition. in connection with the bridge commitments, we incurred $5.5 million in financing costs, of which, $3.4 million was recognized as of december 31, 2016 and the remainder was recognized in 2017. these financing costs were paid in february 2017. the bridge commitments terminated upon our execution of an amendment and restatement of our credit agreement.
the aggregate total fair value of consideration for the acquisitions we made in 2016 and 2015 was $22.8 million and $96.5 million, respectively. see note 3 and note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding our acquisitions.
in april 2016 and january 2017, we exchanged $219.2 million and $91.7 million, respectively, aggregate outstanding principal amount of the convertible notes for an aggregate of $313.9 million in cash (which amount includes approximately $3.0 million in accrued and previously unpaid interest) and approximately 3.10 million shares of our common stock (the "exchange transactions"). we funded the cash portion of the consideration paid through borrowings under our revolving credit facility. in addition, during 2016, we delivered $44.4 million in cash and 0.4 million shares of our common stock to holders of $44.4 million aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes who
47
exercised their conversion rights under the convertible notes. we funded the cash portion of the conversion obligation through borrowings under our revolving credit facility. as of february 13, 2017 the outstanding balance of the convertible notes, after giving effect to january 2017 exchange transactions, was $44.3 million. our convertible notes are scheduled to mature in 2017 and we intend to repay the convertible notes with funds available under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand.
we may at any time, from time to time, repurchase our outstanding debt securities in open market purchases or by tender at any price or in privately negotiated transactions, exchange transactions or otherwise. such purchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors and may be commenced or suspended at any time.
see "financing arrangements" below as well as note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for further information related to our borrowings.

the net cash inflow from working capital is primarily the result of an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease in inventories partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable. the cash inflow for accounts payable and accrued expenses was $15.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to a cash outflow of $0.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. the cash inflow for accounts payable and accrued expenses, excluding the impact of the net increase in the restructuring reserve, is attributable to certain non-recurring accrued expense payments made during the year ended december 31, 2015. the cash inflow for inventories was $6.4 million in 2016 as compared to a $8.4 million net cash outflow in 2015. the lower inventory levels in 2016 are primarily the result of higher than expected net revenues in the fourth quarter and fewer inventory builds in support of distributor to direct sales conversions. the cash outflow related to accounts receivable was $11.0 million in 2016 as compared to a cash inflow of $0.4 million in 2015. the increase in accounts receivable for the year ended december 31, 2016 is attributable to higher fourth quarter net revenues as compared to 2015, partially offset by stronger collections, particularly in europe.
cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $57.0 million during 2016, primarily resulting from capital expenditures of $53.1 million and payments for businesses and intangibles acquired of $14.0 million. the acquired business and intangibles included certain assets of cartika medical, inc. and certain distributors in new
48
zealand, which were comprised primarily of intangible assets, including goodwill, and inventory. these payments were partially offset by proceeds from asset sales of $10.2 million, primarily related to two buildings.
cash flow from financing activities net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $118.7 million during 2016, primarily resulting from dividends paid of $59.0 million and a net reduction in borrowings of $42.9 million. the net reduction in borrowings was comprised of $263.6 million in reductions resulting from exchange and conversion transactions related to the 3.875% convertible senior subordinated notes and the net reduction in our revolving credit facility of $186.0 million, partially offset by the issuance of the $400.0 million of our 4.875% senior notes due 2026 and increased borrowings against the securitization program of $6.7 million. net cash used in financing activities was also impacted by a $9.2 million payment for our acquisition of the remaining 26% noncontrolling interest of teleflex medical private limited, our indian affiliate, debt extinguishment, issuance and amendment fees, including transaction fees associated with the issuance of the 2026 notes of $9.0 million and contingent consideration payments of $7.3 million. these cash outflows were partially offset by $9.1 million of net proceeds from share-based compensation plans and the related tax benefits, primarily related to stock option exercises.
comparison of 2015 to 2014
cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $303.4 million during 2015 compared to $290.2 million during 2014. the $13.2 million increase is primarily due to improved operating results partially offset by an increase in contributions to pension plans of $3.3 million, an increase in income tax payments, net of refunds, of $3.2 million, an increase in payments associated with restructuring programs and other unfavorable working capital items.
the net cash outflow from the other working capital items is primarily the result of cash outflows for inventories and accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by a cash inflow for accounts receivable. the net cash outflow for the purchase of inventories was $8.4 million in 2015 as compared to a $15.5 million net cash outflow in 2014. the reduction in the cash outflow is primarily due to service level improvements and the consolidation of distribution facilities associated with restructuring initiatives as well as fewer inventory builds in support of distributor to direct conversions. the accounts payable and accrued expenses net cash outflow was $0.1 million in 2015 as compared to cash outflow of $9.8 million in 2014. the decrease in the cash outflow is primarily a result of the timing of vendor and employee related benefit payments as well as a $4.0 million decrease in interest payments year-over-year. the net cash inflow for accounts receivable was $0.4 million during 2015 as compared to a cash inflow of $9.4 million in 2014, which was primarily the result of increased collections in the emea region in 2014.
cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $154.8 million during 2015, primarily due to net payments of $93.8 million for the businesses acquired in 2015, which included nostix, llc, a developer of catheter tip confirmation systems, truphatek holdings limited and atsina surgical, llc, a developer of surgical clips, among others, and capital expenditures of $61.4 million.
cash flow from financing activities net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $85.6 million during 2015, primarily resulting from repayments of outstanding debt totaling $303.8 million, including the redemption of the entire $250 million outstanding principal amount of the 2019 notes and the repayment of $50 million and $3.5 million under our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility, respectively. additionally, we paid $56.5 million in dividends and $8.0 million in contingent consideration related to our acquisition of mini-lap. we also incurred $9.0 million of debt extinguishment, issuance and amendment fees, primarily as a result of a make whole payment in connection with the redemption of the 2019 notes. these cash outflows were partially offset by $288.1 million of proceeds from borrowings, including $246.0 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and $42.1 million of borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility. in addition, we realized net cash inflows of $5.0 million from share-based compensation activity, which included proceeds from the exercise and vesting of share-based awards under our stock compensation plans and the related tax benefits, partially offset by tax withholdings that we remitted on behalf of
49
employees who have elected to have shares withheld by us to satisfy their minimum tax withholding obligations arising from the exercise and vesting of their share-based awards.

fixed rate debt comprised 75.1% and 59.7% of total debt at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the increase in fixed rate borrowings as of december 31, 2016 compared to the prior year is primarily due to the issuance of the 2026 notes and the decrease in variable rate borrowings under our senior credit facility.
former senior credit facility at december 31, 2016, we had $210.0 million in borrowings outstanding and approximately $3.2 million in outstanding standby letters of credit under our $850 million revolving credit facility, which was made available to us under a senior credit agreement. this facility, which was replaced with an increased revolving credit facility under the amended and restated credit agreement described below, was used principally for working capital needs and, at certain times, to help fund acquisitions. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding our former senior credit facility.
amended and restated senior credit facility on january 20, 2017 (the "effective date"), we amended and restated our then-existing senior credit agreement by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement ("2017 credit agreement"). the 2017 credit agreement provides for a five-year revolving credit facility of $1.0 billion and a term loan facility of $750.0 million. the term loan facility and borrowings under the revolving credit facility were used to finance the acquisition of vascular solutions. the obligations under the 2017 credit agreement are guaranteed (subject to certain exceptions and limitations) by substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a lien on substantially all of our and each guarantor's owned assets. the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility will mature on january 20, 2022 and february 17, 2022, respectively.
the 2017 credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, qualifications and thresholds, place limitations on our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to incur additional indebtedness, create additional liens, enter into a merger, consolidation or amalgamation, dispose of certain assets, make certain investments or acquisitions, pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock and enter into swap agreements. additionally, the 2017 credit agreement contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a consolidated total leverage ratio (generally, the ratio of consolidated total funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda, each as defined in the 2017 credit agreement) of not more than 4.50 to 1, a secured leverage ratio (generally, the ratio of consolidated senior secured funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda, each as defined in the 2017 credit agreement) of not
50
more than 3.50 to 1 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio (generally, the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense, each as defined in the 2017 credit agreement) of not less than 3.50 to 1, in each case, for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or most recently ended prior to the determination date, and calculated in accordance with the definitions and methodologies set forth in the 2017 credit agreement.
see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding this new credit facility.
2024 and 2026 notes as of december 31, 2016, the outstanding principal of the 2024 notes and 2026 notes were $250.0 million and $400.0 million, respectively. the indenture governing the 2024 and 2026 notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to incur debt, create liens, consolidate, merge or dispose of certain assets, make certain investments, engage in acquisitions, and pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock, subject to specified conditions. the obligations under the 2024 and 2026 notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by each of our existing and future 100% owned domestic subsidiaries that are a guarantor or other obligor under our senior credit agreement and by certain of our other 100% owned domestic subsidiaries. as of december 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all of the terms of our 2024 and 2026 notes.
convertible notes our convertible notes are included in the dilutive earnings per share calculation using the treasury stock method. under the treasury stock method, we must calculate the number of shares of common stock issuable under the terms of the convertible notes based on the average market price of our common stock during the applicable reporting period, and include that number in the total diluted shares figure for the period. at the time we issued the convertible notes, we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant agreements that together were designed to have the economic effect of reducing the net number of shares that will be issued upon conversion of the convertible notes by, in effect, increasing the conversion price of the convertible notes, from our economic standpoint, to $74.65. however, under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"), since the impact of the convertible note hedge agreements is anti-dilutive, we exclude from the calculation of fully diluted shares the number of shares of our common stock that we would receive from the counterparties to these agreements upon settlement.
under the treasury stock method, changes in the price per share of our common stock can have a significant impact on the number of shares that we must include in the fully diluted earnings per share calculation, although the impact of such potential changes has been substantially reduced as a result of our repurchase of $310.9 million principal amount of convertible notes in the exchange transactions and aggregate conversions totaling $44.8 million principal amount of convertible notes through february 13, 2017, as described below. the following table illustrates how, based on the $44.3 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes outstanding as of february 13, 2017, changes in our stock price would affect (i) the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes, (ii) the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants subject to the warrant agreements, (iii) the number of additional shares deemed outstanding with respect to the convertible notes, after applying the treasury stock method, for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share ("total treasury stock method incremental shares"), (iv) the number of shares of common stock deliverable to us upon settlement of the hedge agreements and (v) the number of shares issuable upon concurrent conversion of the convertible notes, exercise of the warrants and settlement of the convertible note hedge agreements:

(1)   represents the number of incremental shares that must be included in the calculation of fully diluted shares under gaap.
our convertible notes are convertible under certain circumstances, including in any fiscal quarter following an immediately preceding fiscal quarter in which the last reported sales price of our common stock for at least 20 days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last day of such preceding fiscal quarter exceeds 130% of the conversion price of the convertible notes (approximately $79.72). since the fourth quarter of 2013 and in all subsequent periods through december 31, 2016, the last reported sale price of our common stock exceeded the established 130% threshold. moreover, commencing on may 1, 2017 and through july 28, 2017, the convertible notes are convertible regardless of our stock price. the convertible notes will mature in august 2017. in april 2016 and january 2017, as described above in this "liquidity and capital resources" section, we exchanged cash and common stock for $310.9 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of the convertible notes in the exchange transactions.
accounts receivable securitization we have an accounts receivable securitization facility under which we sell a security interest in domestic accounts receivable for consideration of up to $50.0 million to a commercial paper conduit. as of december 31, 2016, we borrowed the maximum amount available of $50.0 million under this facility. this facility is utilized to provide increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements. the agreement governing the accounts receivable securitization facility contains certain covenants and termination events. an occurrence of an event of default or a termination event under this facility may give rise to the right of our counterparty to terminate this facility. as of december 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants and none of the termination events had occurred. as of december 31, 2015, we had $43.3 million of outstanding borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility.

we recorded a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions of $17.5 million and $40.4 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of ongoing or future tax examinations, we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any income tax payments that will be required to settle uncertain income tax positions or the periods in which any such payments will be made and as a result, these amounts are excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
we recorded contingent consideration liabilities of $7.1 million and $20.8 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of which, $0.6 million and $7.3 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were recorded as the current portion of contingent consideration. due to uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of future payments related to these liabilities, these amounts are excluded from the contractual obligations table above.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ materially from the amounts derived from those estimates and assumptions.
we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates, which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. the following discussion should be considered in conjunction with the description of our accounting policies in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k.
accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts in the ordinary course of business, we grant non-interest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms.  in an effort to reduce our credit risk, we (i) establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships, (ii) perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition, (iii) monitor the payment history and aging of our customers' receivables, and (iv) monitor open orders against an individual customer's outstanding receivable balance.
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for trade accounts receivable based on the company's historical collection experience and expected collectability of accounts receivable, considering the length of time an account is outstanding, the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services. the adequacy
53
of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary. our allowance for doubtful accounts was $8.6 million and $8.0 million at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which constituted 3.0% and 2.9% of gross trade accounts receivable at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
in light of the volatility in global economic markets in recent years, we have measures in place within countries where we have collectability concerns to facilitate customer-by-customer risk assessment when estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts.  such measures include monthly credit control committee meetings, at which customer credit risks are identified after review of, among other things, accounts that exceed specified credit limits, payment delinquencies and other customer issues.  in addition, with respect to certain of our non-government customers, we have instituted measures designed to reduce our risk exposures, including reducing credit limits and requiring that payments accompany orders.  with respect to government customers, we evaluate receivables for potential collection risks associated with any limitations on the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices.  some of our customers, particularly in greece, italy, spain and portugal, have extended or delayed payments for products and services already provided resulting in collectability concerns regarding our accounts receivable from these customers. if the financial condition of these customers or the healthcare systems in these countries deteriorate to the extent that the ability of an increasing number of customers to make payments is uncertain, additional allowances may be required in future periods.
although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments, we cannot be assured that we will continue to experience the same loss rate in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy.  if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible, we would be required to incur additional charges, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.  moreover, our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations.
distributor rebates we offer rebates to certain distributors and record a reserve with respect to the estimated amount of the rebates as a reduction of revenues at the time of sale. in estimating rebates, we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributor's rebate claim, distributor-specific trend analyses, contractual commitments, including stated rebate rates, historical experience and other relevant information. when necessary, we adjust the reserves, with a corresponding adjustment to revenue, to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience. historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant and we do not expect significant revisions of these estimates in the future. the reserve for estimated rebates was $11.6 million and $11.1 million at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we expect amounts subject to the reserve as of december 31, 2016 to be paid within 90 days subsequent to year-end.
inventory utilization inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. we maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory that reduces the carrying value of our inventories to reflect the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence, damage or other issues affecting marketability by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value.  factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include (i) current sales data and historical return rates, (ii) estimates of future demand, (iii) competitive pricing pressures, (iv) new product introductions, (v) product expiration dates, and (vi) component and packaging obsolescence.
the adequacy of this reserve is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary.  we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. in assessing historical usage, we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information in estimating future usage.
our inventory reserve was $36.4 million and $36.5 million at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which represents 10.3% and 10.0% of gross inventories at those respective dates.
accounting for long-lived assets we assess the remaining useful life and recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. for example, such an assessment may be initiated if, as a result of a change in expectations, we believe it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold or disposed of
54
significantly before the end of its useful life or if an adverse change occurs in the business employing the asset. significant judgments in this area involve determining whether such events or circumstances have occurred and determining the appropriate asset group requiring evaluation. the recoverability evaluation is based on various analyses, including undiscounted cash flow projections, which involve significant management judgment. any impairment loss, if indicated, equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets include indefinite-lived assets (such as goodwill, certain trade names and in-process research and development ("ipr&d")), as well as finite-lived intangibles (such as trade names that do not have indefinite lives, customer relationships, intellectual property and distribution rights). the costs of finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life. determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires considerable judgment as different types of intangible assets typically will have different useful lives. goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, primarily certain trade names, are not amortized; we test these assets annually for impairment during the fourth quarter, using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment may have occurred. such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations. our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles.
considerable management judgment is necessary in making the assumptions used in the impairment analysis including evaluating the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and estimating future cash flows, which are key elements in determining fair value. assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.
goodwill goodwill impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level. for purposes of this assessment, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or a business one level below that operating segment. we have a total of ten reporting units, nine of which have goodwill. in applying the goodwill impairment test, we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance. if, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a two-step quantitative impairment test, described below. alternatively, we may proceed directly to testing goodwill for impairment through the two-step quantitative impairment test without conducting the qualitative analysis. in the fourth quarter 2016, we performed a qualitative assessment on six of our reporting units and determined that the fair value of each reporting unit was more likely than not higher than its carrying value and, therefore, concluded that goodwill was not impaired. for the three remaining reporting units whose assets included goodwill, we elected to forgo the qualitative assessment and perform the two-step quantitative impairment test.
the first step of the two-step impairment test is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying value. in performing the first step, we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit using equal weighting of two methods; one which estimates the discounted cash flows of the reporting unit based on projected earnings in the future (the income approach) and one which is based on sales of similar businesses to those of the reporting unit in actual transactions (the market approach).  if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, there is no impairment. if the reporting unit carrying value exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, which we determine in the second step of the two-step test. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit's identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole, as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed were being determined initially.
determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment. the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the income approach include (1) the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales, operating income, industry trends and the regulatory environment of the individual reporting units, (2) the expected long-term growth rates for each of our reporting units, which approximate the expected long-term growth rate of the global economy and of the medical device industry, and (3) discount rates
55
that are used to discount future cash flows to their present values, which are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs.  the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the market approach include (1) determination of appropriate revenue and ebitda multiples used to estimate a reporting unit's fair value and (2) the selection of appropriate comparable companies to be used for purposes of determining those multiples. there were no changes to the underlying methods used in 2016 as compared to the valuations of our reporting units in 2015. the discount rate was 10.0% for all reporting units. a perpetual growth rate of 2.5% was assumed for all reporting units.
our expected future growth rates estimated for purposes of the goodwill impairment test are based on our estimates of future sales, operating income and cash flow and are consistent with our internal budgets and business plans, which reflect a modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful launch of new products each year; the effect of these growth indicators more than offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach the end of their life cycle. changes in assumptions underlying the income approach could cause a reporting unit's carrying value to exceed its fair value. while we believe the assumed growth rates of sales and cash flows are reasonable, the possibility remains that the revenue growth of a reporting unit may not be as high as expected, and, as a result, the estimated fair value of that reporting unit may decline. in this regard, if our strategy and new products are not successful and we do not achieve anticipated core revenue growth in the future with respect to a reporting unit, the goodwill in the reporting unit may become impaired and, in such case, we may incur material impairment charges. moreover, changes in revenue and ebitda multiples in actual transactions from those historically present could result in an assessment that a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, in which case we also may incur material impairment charges.
no impairment was recorded as a result of the annual goodwill impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter 2016.
other intangible assets intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill. management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. similar to the goodwill impairment test process, we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. if, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount, the asset is not impaired. if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, we then proceed to a quantitative impairment test, which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount. alternatively, we may elect to forgo the qualitative analysis and proceed directly to testing the indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment through the quantitative impairment test. in the fourth quarter 2016, we performed a qualitative assessment on one of our indefinite lived assets and determined that its fair value was more likely than not higher than its carrying value. for the remaining four indefinite-lived intangible assets, we elected to test impairment through the quantitative method.
in connection with the quantitative impairment test, since quoted market prices are seldom available for intangible assets, we utilize several present value techniques to estimate fair value. the fair value of trade names and ipr&d is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method, a form of income approach that values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset. under this method, an owner of an intangible asset determines the arm's length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party. the value of the hypothetical royalty, which is based on the estimated royalty rate applied against forecasted sales, is tax-effected and discounted to present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset. management must estimate the volume of sales, hypothetical royalty rate, discount rate, and terminal growth rate to estimate the hypothetical royalty associated with the asset.
discount rates and perpetual growth rates utilized in the impairment test of the trade names during the fourth quarter 2016 are comparable to the rates utilized in the impairment test of goodwill and we assumed a royalty rate of 4%. discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows generated from the intangible asset. assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar trade names are being licensed in the marketplace.
no impairment was recorded as a result of the annual trade name impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter 2016. for the year ended december 31, 2016, we recognized a pre-tax ipr&d impairment charge of $41.0
56
million. see "restructuring and other impairment charges" within the "result of operations" above as well as note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information on this charge.
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees, including under plans that provide pension and postretirement healthcare benefits. several statistical and other factors that are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans. these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates. we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate.
significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense. the following table shows the sensitivity of plan expenses and benefit obligations to changes in the weighted average assumptions:
assumed discount rate                                                   expected return on plan assets                          assumed healthcare trend rate
50 basis point increase                 50 basis point decrease         50 basis point change                       1.0% increase          1.0% decrease
(dollars in millions)
net periodic pension and postretirement healthcare expense   $(0.2               )                            $0.2                   $1.5                                          $0.2                 $(0.2         )
projected benefit obligation                                 $(28.0              )                           $30.9                   n/a                                           $3.4                 $(3.0         )

share-based compensation we estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model. the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods. share-based compensation expense related to stock options is measured using a black-scholes option pricing model that takes into account subjective and complex assumptions with respect to expected life of options, volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. the expected life of options granted represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding, which is derived from the vesting period of the award, as well as historical exercise behavior. expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase our common stock, which we believe is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than solely using historical volatility. the risk-free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on united states treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option. share based compensation expense for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $16.9 million, $14.5 million and $12.2 million, respectively.
accounting for contingent consideration liabilities in connection with an acquisition, we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives, such as receipt of regulatory approval, commercialization of a product or achievement of sales targets. as of the acquisition date, we record a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay. the fair value of the contingent consideration liability at december 31, 2016 is calculated based on a discounted cash flow analysis using significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a level 3 measurement. we remeasure this liability each reporting period and recognize the change in the liability's fair value in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. an increase or decrease in the fair value can result from changes in the estimated sales royalties and the discount rate. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, we accrued $7.1 million and $20.8 million of contingent consideration, respectively. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 we recorded reductions to contingent consideration of $8.3 million, $4.4 million and $8.2 million, respectively, resulting from changes in estimated probabilities associated with certain regulatory and sales milestones.
57
accounting for income taxes our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. we conduct a broad range of operations around the world, subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes with tax authorities and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. in connection with its estimates of our tax assets and liabilities, management must, among other things, make judgments about the outcome of these uncertain matters. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates, which we expect will apply to taxable income in the years in which differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases are recovered or settled. the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income, our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks, final united states and foreign tax settlements, changes in tax law, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions. while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities, which could be material.
in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we evaluate all positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events, including results of operations and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. based on this assessment, we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized, in which case we apply a valuation allowance to offset the amount of such deferred tax assets.  to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.
the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $104.5 million and $103.5 million at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions.
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. we establish additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. in the normal course of business, we are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities. we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. we adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which we become aware of facts that necessitate an adjustment. we are currently under examination by the canadian tax authorities with respect to our income tax returns for various tax years. the ultimate outcome of the examination could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities, which would affect our financial results.
see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding our uncertain tax positions.
new accounting standards see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards, including estimated effects, if any, of the adoption of those standards on our consolidated financial statements.

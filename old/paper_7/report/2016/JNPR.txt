item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes in item 8 of part ii of this report.
the following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or u.s. gaap. in the course of operating our business, we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices, the collection of receivables, the manufacturing and shipment of products, the fulfillment of orders, the purchase of supplies, and the building of inventory and spare parts, among other matters. each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period. in making these decisions, we consider various factors including contractual obligations, customer satisfaction, competition, internal and external financial targets and expectations, and financial planning objectives. for further information about our critical accounting policies and estimates, see "critical accounting policies and estimates" section included in this "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
to aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this report, we have provided an executive overview and a summary of the business and market environment. these sections should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in this item 7, our "risk factors" section included in item 1a of part i, and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item 8 of part ii of this report.
business and market environment juniper networks designs, develops, and sells products and services for high-performance networks, to enable customers to build scalable, reliable, secure and cost-effective networks for their businesses, while achieving agility, efficiency and value through automation. we focus on customers and partners across our key market verticals who view these network attributes as fundamental to their business; including telecom, cable providers, cloud providers, national government, financial services, and strategic enterprise verticals.
our products are sold in three geographic regions: americas; europe, middle east, and africa, or emea; and asia pacific, or apac. our high-performance routing, switching, and security networking products and service offerings are sold to global service providers, cloud providers, national governments, research and public sector organizations and other enterprises who view the network as critical to their success. we believe that our silicon, systems, and software represent innovations that transform the economics and experience of networking, helping our customers achieve superior performance, greater choice, and flexibility, while reducing overall total cost of ownership. in addition to our products, we offer our customers worldwide services, including technical support, professional services, and education and training programs.
our fiscal 2016 results saw modest net revenue growth that was primarily driven by cloud providers, which increased more than 25% in 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. while routing revenue was slightly down, our ptx family of products had significant year-over-year growth. switching revenue increased 12% in 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 driven by continued data center strength led by our qfx family of products, which increased more than 50% year-over-year. our security revenues continued to decline as this component of our business is transitioning from legacy security products to our new srx security offerings, which were introduced throughout 2016. we expect this transition in security to continue over the next few quarters. our services business continues to be strong with another year of solid year-over-year revenue growth, increasing 13% in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.
in reviewing our top 10 customers for the year, four were cloud providers, four were telecoms, and two were enterprises. of these customers, two were located outside of the u.s.
we continue to operate in a competitive market and expect the timing of our customers' deployment patterns to vary from quarter to quarter. we intend to manage our business in 2017 with these considerations in mind and will continue to focus on driving shareholder value. we expect to adhere to the following three financial principles that provide insight into our operating plans for 2017:
•   we will continue to pursue opportunities for revenue growth in 2017 with our differentiated product portfolio within our target markets and will focus on growth from emerging technologies as the market landscape continues to evolve.
•   we remain focused on earnings expansion with long-term consistency. we will remain diligent in managing our operating expenses while also investing in our product portfolio for the short and long-term.
39
•   we intend to maintain a healthy balance sheet and an optimized capital structure, while balancing internal investments and the potential for value-enhancing m&amp;a. we expect continued strong cash flow generation and intend to return approximately 50% of free cash flow to shareholders. free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.
we are focused on operational excellence, cost discipline and targeted growth initiatives, as well as partnerships and expect to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions. in 2016, we completed three acquisitions that we expect will further enhance our product portfolio and that we believe will allow us to accelerate our strategy to transition to cloud-based markets. in april 2016, we acquired optical equipment provider bti systems inc., or bti, which we expect will accelerate our ability to address the data center interconnect, or dci, and metro ethernet markets with open, programmable and automated, packet optical transport solutions. then in august 2016, we acquired aurrion, inc., or aurrion, a provider of fabless silicon photonic technology, which we expect will strengthen our long-term competitive advantage in cost-effective, high-density, high-speed optical networks. lastly, in december 2016 we acquired appformix, a company focused on cloud infrastructure optimization software, which we expect will complement the analytics and capabilities of contrail and help customers enhance their cloud operations. we expect that we will continue to look at targeted and strategic acquisitions that we believe can complement our product portfolio, operations or r&d strategy.
further, our intent is to lead in the area of software solutions that simplify the operation of networks, and to allow our customers across our key verticals to deliver real value over those networks. we anticipate that our increased focus on software business models will result in an increase in software revenue as a percentage of total revenue over time.
in 2016, we continued to execute on our strategy with significant advancements in performance and automation across a number of key solution areas and announced a number of new products and enhancements to our hardware and software products across routing, switching, and security.
in routing, our solution for wide area ip transport across data center interconnect, metro, and core was enhanced with the introduction of our newest ptx line-cards, coupled with our multi-layer optimization controller, northstar.
in switching, we announced two new access switches, the ex2300 and ex3400 in 2016. further, we introduced juniper networks cloud-enabled branch, a solution that will allow enterprises and managed service providers alike to create and automate delivery of branch office networking services on-demand.
in security, we announced juniper networks csrx, a next-generation containerized firewall providing advanced security services for software-defined secure networks, or sdsn, as well as a multi-core version of the juniper networks vsrx. we also announced junos space security director, policy enforcer, new srx4100 and srx4200 firewalls, and new enhancements to sky advanced threat prevention, or sky atp, to further build out our sdsn platform.
we also expanded our global alliances with nec to deliver nfv-based solutions that allow service providers and enterprises to gain greater service agility through automation.
we believe we are entering 2017 with a competitive product portfolio and a determination to enable our customers' cloud businesses, or to successfully migrate to cloud architectures. the cloud transformation is our primary area of strategic focus as we see significant opportunities arising from the shift towards the cloud and network automation. we believe our history as an innovation leader and our understanding of high performance networking technology position us to capitalize on this industry transition.

________________________________
(*)   dso and product book-to-bill are for the fourth quarter ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.
•   net revenues: during 2016, net revenues increased, compared to 2015, due to strong growth in services revenues partially offset by a slight decline in product revenue. the decline in product revenue was primarily driven by a decline in revenues from our mx products, as well as our security products. in addition, we saw continued competitive pricing pressures, partially offset by revenue growth from our new products, specifically in switching where we saw continued data center strength.
•   gross margin: our gross margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased during 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to elevated pricing pressures, product mix, and charges related to the expected remediation costs for certain products containing a defect in a clock-signal component from a third-party supplier, partially offset by an improvement in services margin and our supply chain cost structure. we expect that we will continue to experience elevated pricing pressures in the near term.
•   operating income (loss): during 2016, compared to 2015, operating income as a percentage of net revenues decreased as a result of higher operating expense primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2016 as well as a decline in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue, partially offset by savings in variable compensation and improvements to our supply chain cost structure.
•   capital return: during 2016, we completed our full commitment to return $4.1 billion of capital, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, to shareholders from 2014 through the end of 2016. during 2016, we repurchased 13.5 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase of $312.9 million and paid cash dividends of $0.10 per share each quarter for an aggregate annual amount of $152.5 million. beginning in 2017, we intend to target a capital return policy of approximately 50% of annual free cash flow, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends.
41
•   operating cash flows: cash flow from operations increased by $213.5 million in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily driven by timing differences in working capital.
•   dso: dso is calculated as the ratio of ending accounts receivable, net of allowances, divided by average daily net sales for the preceding 90 days. dso for the quarter ended december 31, 2016 increased by 15 days, or 28% compared to the quarter ended december 31, 2015. the elevated dso was primarily due to a significant increase in invoicing of services which occurred late in 2016 and resulted in higher deferred services revenue, as well as the timing of product invoicing. we believe the quality of our receivables is strong as the majority has been received early in the first quarter of 2017. going forward we expect dso to be in the 50 to 60 days range.
•   product book-to-bill: product book-to-bill represents the ratio of product orders booked divided by product revenues during the respective period. product book-to-bill was greater than one for the quarters ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, which we believe indicates positive product demand.
•   deferred revenue: total deferred revenue increased by $313.0 million to $1,481.1 million as of december 31, 2016, compared to $1,168.1 million as of december 31, 2015, primarily due to (1) an increase in deferred service revenue of $230.4 million driven by an increase in multi-year support agreements, which are billed in advance, and (2) an increase in product deferred revenue primarily due to higher deferrals related to software revenue arrangements, which are recognized ratably over the agreement, and other shipments that have not met all revenue recognition criteria. in circumstances when costs are deferred, deferred product revenue is recorded net of the related costs of product revenue.
in february 2017, we completed our evaluation of the impact of a defect in a clock-signal component contained in certain of our products which may begin to fail after the product has been in operation for 18 months as advised by the third party component supplier. as a result, we recorded a product cost of revenue charge of approximately $10.8 million in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2016 for the expected remediation costs of the component defect. we are in the process of working with our customers and the component supplier to implement a remediation.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. gaap requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to sales returns, pricing credits, warranty costs, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long-term assets, especially goodwill and intangible assets, contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges, assumptions used in the valuation of share-based compensation, and litigation. we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. for further information about our significant accounting policies, see note 2, significant accounting policies, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report, which describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future consolidated results of operations may be affected.
•   goodwill. we make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. these estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected customer retention rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customer and product base, and the expected use of the acquired assets. these factors are also considered in determining the useful life of the acquired intangible assets. the amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense.
goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recorded. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets of businesses acquired in a business combination is recognized as goodwill. we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, as of november 1st, or more frequently if an event occurs or facts and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amount.
42
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segment level, by comparing the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. the reporting units are determined based on the components of our operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly review the operating results of the component.
the provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangibles allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. various factors are considered in the qualitative assessment, including macroeconomic conditions, financial performance, or a sustained decrease in share price. if as a result of the qualitative assessment, it is deemed more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, management will perform the quantitative test.
the quantitative goodwill impairment test, if necessary, involves a two-step process to identify goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized, if any. the first step tests for potential impairment by comparing the fair value of reporting units with the reporting unit's net asset values. if the fair value of the reporting units exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit's net assets, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. if the fair value of the reporting units does not exceed the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit, then we perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. the second step requires an assignment of the reporting unit's fair value to the reporting unit's assets and liabilities, using the relevant acquisition accounting guidance, to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill, and if the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference.
in the first step, the fair value of each of our reporting units is determined using both the income and market valuation approaches. we believe the income approach and the market approach are equally representative of the reporting unit's fair value. under the income approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life. under the market approach, the value of the reporting unit is based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting unit to values of publicly-traded companies in similar lines of business. in the application of the income and market valuation approaches, we are required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables. determining the fair value of a reporting unit is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. actual future results related to assumed variables could differ from these estimates. in addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units.
under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. cash flow projections are based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. the discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the business's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, and then apply a control premium which is determined by considering control premiums offered as part of the acquisitions that have occurred in market segments that are comparable with our reporting units. the income approach and the market approach are equally weighted to derive the fair value of the reporting unit.
during the fourth quarter of 2016, we performed a quantitative assessment for all of our reporting units: routing, switching, and security. this quantitative assessment was performed by determining the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. based on the outcome of the quantitative assessments, we determined that the fair values of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its respective carrying value, resulting in no goodwill impairment.
refer to item 8 of part ii, note 7, goodwill and purchased intangible assets, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for further information.

•   inventory valuation and contract manufacturer liabilities. inventory consists primarily of component parts to be used in the manufacturing process and is stated at lower of cost or market. a provision is recorded when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete, to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value. in determining the provision, we also consider estimated recovery rates based on the nature of the inventory. as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, our net inventory balances were $95.5 million and $75.0 million, respectively.
we establish a liability for non-cancelable, non-returnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or obsolete materials charges for components purchased by the contract manufacturers based on our demand forecasts or customer orders. we also take estimated recoveries of aged inventory into consideration when determining the liability. as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, our contract manufacturer liabilities were $14.0 million and $18.0 million, respectively.
significant judgment is used in establishing our forecasts of future demand, recovery rates based on the nature and age of inventory, and obsolete material exposures. we perform a detailed analysis and review of data used in establishing our demand forecasts. if the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast, which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and our customer requirements, we may be required to increase our inventory write-downs and contract manufacturer liabilities, which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities. inventory and supply chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order to reduce lead times.
•   revenue recognition. revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred, (3) sales price is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. we enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and while some of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. as a result, significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and, if so, how the price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. changes in the allocation of the sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition but will not change the total revenue recognized on the contract.
under our revenue recognition policies, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy. the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor-specific objective evidence, or vsoe, if available, third-party evidence, or tpe, if vsoe is not available, or estimated selling price, or esp, if neither vsoe nor tpe is available. we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately. tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in stand-alone sales to similarly situated customers. we do not use tpe as we do not consider our products to be similar or interchangeable to our competitors' products in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. esp is established considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and product life cycle. consideration is also given to market conditions such as industry pricing strategies and technology life cycles. when determining esp, we apply management judgment to establish margin objectives and pricing strategies and to evaluate market conditions and product life cycles. revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual support period, which is generally one to three years.
•   income taxes. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our taxes. although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by expiration of or lapses in the r&d tax credit laws; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany r&d cost-sharing arrangement and legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, including possible u.s. changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules. in addition, the oecd's recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, as adopted by countries, will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
•   loss contingencies. we use significant judgment and assumptions to estimate the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, in determining loss contingencies. an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. we record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 2, significant accounting policies, in notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on financial condition and results of operations, which is incorporated herein by reference.
results of operations we sell our high-performance networking products and service offerings across routing, switching, and security to two primary markets: service provider and enterprise. our determination of the market to which a particular revenue transaction relates is based primarily upon the customer's industrial classification code, but may also include subjective factors such as the intended use of the product. the service provider market generally includes wireline and wireless carriers, and cable operators, as well as major internet content and application providers. the enterprise market is generally comprised of federal, state, and local governments; research and education institutions; financial services and other businesses.

2016 compared to 2015
routing product net revenues decreased slightly in 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to a decline in revenues from our mx products, resulting from lower demand from telecom in the americas and emea, which is impacted by the timing of large deployments. net revenues from our legacy t series products continued to decline, as expected, as we continue to transition to our next-generation ptx series of products. these declines were significantly offset by a strong increase in revenues from our ptx series products due to higher sales to cloud providers and telecom, as well as the ramp up of sales of our new products, which we expect to continue over the next few quarters.
switching product net revenues increased in 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, as a result of continued growth from our data center switching portfolio, driven by higher net revenues from our qfx product family, which increased over 50% year-over-year, driven by the ramp up of sales of our new product offerings, as well as an increase in revenue from cloud providers. this was partially offset by lower demand for our ex products, as we transition to our new ex product portfolio. we are focused on the growing cloud and data center market, and expect our expanded data center switching portfolio will continue to drive revenue growth in our switching business in the foreseeable future.
security product net revenues decreased in 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to lower net revenues from our srx products, which have been undergoing a product refresh cycle, as well as the continued decline of our screen os and other legacy products. we continue to expect that our screen os and other legacy products will not contribute to meaningful security product revenue growth and should continue to decline over time. we are continuing to introduce newer srx products, and expect this transition to continue over the next few quarters.
the increase in service net revenues in 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily driven by strong attach rates and renewals of support contracts.
2015 compared to 2014
routing product net revenues increased in 2015, compared to 2014, as a result of an increase from cloud providers, cable, and telecom in emea and apac. during 2015, we saw a strong increase in demand from both service provider and enterprise markets for our routing products, as well as an overall increase in net revenues from our mx960, mx2020, and ptx series products.
switching product net revenues increased in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to data center build-outs with telecom and cloud providers. this result was enabled by the significant growth with our qfx product family. additionally, we saw switching net revenues growth in the americas and apac, which was slightly offset by a decrease in emea. we also saw a year-over-year increase in the service provider market for our switching products.
security product net revenues decreased in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to the divestiture of our junos pulse product lines and a continuing decline in our screenos products, which was partially offset by an increase in sales of our srx platform
46
and security software year-over-year. additionally, we also saw a decrease in security net revenues within the enterprise market, which was partially offset by a slight increase in the service provider market.
the increase in service net revenues in 2015, compared to 2014, was primarily driven by new service contracts and strong contract renewals. service revenues are largely correlated with product revenues, therefore if product net revenues decline, it can have an impact on future service revenues.

2016 compared to 2015
net revenues in the americas increased in 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, primarily driven by strong growth from cloud providers, which increased almost 30% year-year-over, as they build out data center environments, as well as a strong increase in service revenues. this was partially offset by lower revenues from cable providers, due to lower demand for our mx products. in the americas, we continue to see opportunities for us to diversify our revenue as cloud provider customers continue to invest in data center networks and network automation.
net revenues in emea decreased in 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in revenues from our strategic enterprise vertical and the timing of deployments of large telecoms, partially offset by growth from cloud providers. to a lesser extent, certain macroeconomic uncertainties in the region and elevated pricing pressures also contributed to the decline in net revenues.
net revenues in apac increased in 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. the increase was driven by cloud providers, partially offset by telecom. geographically, revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in revenues from china and japan, which was partially offset by a decline in revenues from australia.
2015 compared to 2014
net revenues in the americas increased in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to a strong increase in net revenues from both the service provider and enterprise markets. the increase in both the service provider and enterprise markets within the americas was due to an increase in net revenues across routing, switching, and srx product net revenues, as well as service net revenues. in addition, we saw a strong increase in net revenues from cloud providers, cable, and enterprise, partially offset by telecom.
net revenues in emea increased in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in net revenues from telecom and cloud providers slightly offset by a decrease in the enterprise market.
net revenues in apac increased in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in net revenues from telecom and cloud providers. we experienced a significant decline in china, which was partially offset by an increase in net revenues in japan and australia.

net revenues from the enterprise market slightly decreased in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to a decline in revenues from security, partially offset by growth in service revenue. net revenue declines from the enterprise market in emea and apac were partially offset by growth in the americas.
2015 compared to 2014
net revenues from the service provider market increased in 2015, compared to 2014, with growth from cloud providers, telecom in emea and apac, and cable. within the service provider market, we saw strength across routing, switching, and security, with the largest increase in net revenues from routing revenue.
net revenues from the enterprise market increased in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to strength in service and routing, and to a lesser extent, switching, which was partially offset by a slight decrease in revenue from our security products. net revenues in the americas from the enterprise market increased across routing, switching, and srx security.

our gross margins have been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the mix and average selling prices of our products and services, new product introductions and enhancements, manufacturing costs, expenses for inventory obsolescence and warranty obligations, cost of support and service personnel, and the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold.
48
2016 compared to 2015
product gross margin decreased as a percentage of product net revenues in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to elevated pricing pressures, product mix, and expected remediation costs of $10.8 million for certain products containing a defect in a clock-signal component from a third-party supplier, partially offset by improvements in our cost structure. we expect that our product gross margin will continue to vary in the future due to the mix of products sold and competitive pricing pressures. we believe product gross margins as a percentage of net revenues will improve in the long-term from the continued expected acceptance of our new products and technologies, the expected increase in software revenues as a percentage of total revenues as we transition to software-based business models, and as we continue to manage costs within our supply chain.
service gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues increased in 2016, compared to 2015. service gross margin increased year-over-year due to an increase in support revenue as well as improvements in labor productivity and logistics, partially offset by increased support costs related to the ramp up of new products.
2015 compared to 2014
product gross margin increased as a percentage of product net revenues in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to a decrease in product cost of revenues. the decrease in cost of revenues is attributable to the non-recurrence of restructuring charges recorded in 2014 for asset write-downs. no such charges were incurred in 2015. excluding these components from prior year cost of sales, year-over-year gross margin would remain relatively consistent.
service gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues increased in 2015, compared to 2014. services delivery costs increased at a slower rate than service revenue as a result of better labor efficiency and improved product quality.

our operating expenses have historically been driven in large part by personnel-related costs, including wages, commissions, bonuses, benefits, share-based compensation, and travel. facility and information technology, or it, departmental costs are allocated to each department based on usage and headcount. we had a total of 9,832, 9,058, and 8,806 employees as of december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. our headcount increased by 774 employees, or 9%, in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily in research and development, driven by our 2016 business acquisitions, as well as higher services and sales headcount as we focus on delivering our new products to our customers.
49
2016 compared to 2015
research and development research and development expense increased in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily as a result of an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $17.8 million, which was driven by higher capital expenditures related to research and development projects. also contributing to the increase in research and development expense was $13.6 million of higher outside service costs, such as consulting, and higher facilities expense. to a lesser extent, personnel-related expenses increased due to higher salaries, wages, and fringe expense partially offset by lower bonus expense. the increase in salaries and wages was driven by a higher headcount of 4,054 in 2016, compared to 3,723 in 2015, as a result of our 2016 business acquisitions. these increases were partially offset by lower costs of $14.1 million related to the completion of development of new products.
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense increased in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in personnel-related expenses of $26.6 million driven by higher salaries and wages related to an increase in headcount of 2,590 in 2016, compared to 2,464 in 2015 as well as an increase in share-based compensation expense, partially offset by lower bonus and commissions expense.
general and administrative general and administrative expense decreased in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily as a result of lower personnel-related expenses which includes a decline in share-based compensation and lower bonus expense, partially offset by higher salaries and wages. additionally, facilities expense decreased in 2016, compared to 2015, due to the consolidation of our buildings in sunnyvale, california. these declines were partially offset by an increase in outside services related to consulting projects as well as an increase in acquisition costs related to our 2016 business acquisitions.
restructuring and other charges (benefits)
restructuring and other charges (benefits) increased in 2016, compared to 2015, related to severance costs in connection with our 2016 business combinations.
2015 compared to 2014
research and development research and development expense decreased in 2015, compared to 2014, as a result of lower headcount. headcount declined from an average of 3,888 in 2014 to 3,724 in 2015, leading to a reduction in payroll costs and share-based compensation. in addition, outside consulting services decreased due to reduced consulting expenses, which was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense on r&d equipment and bonus expense.
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense decreased in 2015, compared to 2014. average headcount increased from 2,360 in 2014 to 2,464 in 2015, however the mix of employees hired in 2015 was significantly different to 2014, which resulted in lower salary and bonus expense. additionally, commissions expense decreased compared to 2014 as a result of the elimination of certain commission programs and a reduction in sales staff.
general and administrative general and administrative expense decreased in 2015, compared to 2014 primarily as a result of higher litigation and investigation related costs incurred in 2014, in connection with the investigations into possible violations of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, and to a lesser extent, our patent litigation case with palo alto networks. additionally, we saw a decrease in general and administrative consulting fees, which was slightly offset by a higher bad debt expense amount.
50
restructuring and other charges (benefits)
restructuring and other charges (benefits) decreased in 2015, compared to 2014, due to higher charges recorded in 2014 in connection with our 2014 restructuring plan. during 2014, we implemented the 2014 restructuring plan and incurred restructuring charges of $166.2 million related to workforce reductions, contract terminations, project cancellations, and facility closures. the 2014 restructuring plan has been substantially completed as of december 31, 2014.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded $0.4 million of severance costs and a benefit of $1.0 million for facilities that were recorded in restructuring and other charges (benefits) in the consolidated statements of operations, in connection with the 2014 restructuring plan. see note 9, restructuring and other charges (benefits), in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion of our restructuring activities.
impairment of goodwill in 2014, we determined that the security reporting unit's carrying value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of $850.0 million, which was recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. no such charges were recorded in 2015 or 2016.
share-based compensation share-based compensation expense associated with equity incentive awards, or awards, which include stock options; restricted stock units, or rsus; restricted stock awards, or rsas; and performance share awards, or psas; as well as our employee stock purchase plan, or espp, was recorded in the following cost and expense categories (in millions, except percentages):

other (expense) income, net interest income primarily includes interest earned from our cash, cash equivalents, investments, and promissory note issued to juniper in connection with the sale of junos pulse. interest expense primarily includes interest, net of capitalized interest expense, from our short-term and long-term debt and customer financing arrangements. (loss) gain on investments, net, primarily includes gains and losses from the sale of investments in privately-held companies and includes any impairment charges recorded on these investments. other typically consists of foreign exchange gains and losses and other non-operational income and expense items.
2016 compared to 2015
interest income interest income increased in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to higher interest income on our pulse note receivable due to an increase in the interest rate, as well as higher yields from our investment portfolio. see note 8, other financial information, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 in part ii of this report for additional information regarding our pulse note receivable.
interest expense interest expense increased in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to the issuance of our 2019 and 2024 notes, partially offset by the repayment of debt, in the first quarter of 2016. see note 10, debt and financing, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 in part ii of this report for additional information regarding our 2019 and 2024 notes.
(loss) gain on investments, net during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded net losses on investments of $1.8 million, which was primarily driven by impairments on our investments in privately-held companies. whereas during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded a gain on investments of $7.3 million related to the sale of an investment in a privately-held company, which was partially offset by impairments in investments of other privately-held companies.
2015 compared to 2014
interest income interest income increased in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a higher balance of longer term investments yielding higher interest as well as a full year of interest income on the pulse note receivable.
52
interest expense interest expense increased in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to the issuance of our 2020 and 2025 notes in the first quarter of 2015. see note 10, debt and financing, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 in part ii of this report for additional information regarding our 2020 and 2025 notes.
gain on legal settlement, net during the year ended december 31, 2015, no litigation-related gains were recorded, while in 2014, we entered into a settlement agreement with palo alto networks resolving patent litigation between the two companies, which resulted in a realized gain on legal settlement and subsequent sale of related securities of $196.1 million, net of legal fees.
(loss) gain on investments, net during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded a gain of $7.3 million, primarily related to the sale of privately held investments. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded a gain of $163.0 million related to the sale of investments, which were converted from privately-held investments to publicly-traded equity upon initial public offering, or ipo, and subsequently sold.

2016 compared to 2015
the effective tax rate for the tax year 2016 was higher than 2015, primarily due to a change in the geographic mix of earnings. the effective tax rate for the tax year 2015 includes a benefit of $13.2 million related to a change in the tax treatment of share-based compensation in our cost sharing arrangement.
as a result of recommendations by the organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd) on base erosion and profit shifting (beps), certain countries in emea and apac have either enacted new corporate tax legislation or have indicated that they are considering enacting such legislation in the near future. we expect the effect of these reform measures to potentially impact long-standing tax principles, particularly in regards to transfer pricing. consequently, we expect global tax authorities to increasingly challenge our cost sharing and other intercompany arrangements, and the related sourcing of taxable profits in global jurisdictions. in 2016, we entered into discussions with the uk tax authorities and the australian tax authorities regarding corporate tax reform legislation enacted by those countries.
2015 compared to 2014
the effective rate for the tax year 2015 was lower than 2014, primarily due to the income tax that was provided in 2014 on the non-deductible goodwill charge included in the pre-tax loss. in addition, the 2014 effective tax rate includes $52.8 million related to the gain on the sales of junos pulse offset by the release of the company's valuation allowance attributable to investment losses.
our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. our effective tax rate could also fluctuate due to changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items. see item 1a of part ii, risk factors of this report for a description of relevant risks which may adversely affect our results.
for a complete reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% and further explanation of our income tax provision, see note 14, income taxes, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report.

the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable, reduced by short-term debt, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. working capital increased by $1,125.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily due to $1,106.0 million of cash provided from our operating activities and $494.0 million of proceeds received from the issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by $477.1 million of payments for purchases and retirement of our common stock and cash dividends and payment of short-term debt of $300.0 million.
summary of cash flows as of december 31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $412.3 million from december 31, 2015 primarily due to cash generated from operations and proceeds from the issuance of our 2019 notes and 2024 notes, partially offset by purchases and retirement of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program, payment of our 2016 notes, capital expenditures, dividend payments, payments for business acquisitions, and net purchases of available-for-sale investments.
the following table summarizes cash flows from our consolidated statements of cash flows (in millions, except percentages):

operating activities our primary source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers. our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel-related expenditures, and other general operating expenses, as well as payments related to taxes, interest, and facilities.
2016 compared to 2015
net cash provided by operating activities increased by $213.5 million in 2016, compared to 2015. the increase was primarily due an increase in cash received from customers, partially offset by an increase in income taxes paid.
54
2015 compared to 2014
net cash provided by operating activities increased by $129.1 million in 2015, compared to 2014. the increase was primarily due to a decrease in cash payments for personnel-related expenditures, income tax paid in 2015, and an increase in cash received from customers, partially offset by an increase in cash payments to suppliers.
investing activities investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities and redemptions; and cash used for business combinations.
2016 compared to 2015
net cash used in investing activities decreased by $58.6 million in 2016, compared to 2015. the decrease was primary due to a decrease in net purchases of available-for-sale investments, partially offset by an increase in cash used for business acquisitions in 2016.
2015 compared to 2014
net cash used in investing activities increased by $942.7 million in 2015, compared to 2014. the increase was primary due to lower net proceeds from available-for-sale securities in 2015, compared to 2014. in 2014, the sale of available-for-sale securities were higher in order to partially fund our accelerated share repurchase program. in addition, we completed our sale of junos pulse in 2014.
financing activities financing cash flows consist primarily of purchases and retirement of common stock, payment of cash dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and proceeds from the issuance of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.
2016 compared to 2015
net cash used in financing activities decreased by $351.8 million in 2016, compared to 2015. the decrease was primarily due to lower purchases and retirements of our common stock in 2016, partially offset by the payment of our 2016 notes and a decrease in cash proceeds received from the issuance of long-term debt and the issuance of common stock in 2016.
2015 compared to 2014
net cash used in financing activities decreased by $1,242.8 million in 2015, compared to 2014. the decrease was primarily due to lower purchases and retirement of our common stock in 2015.
capital return in february 2014, our board of directors, which we refer to as the board, approved a stock repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to $2.1 billion of our common stock, including $1.2 billion pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase program, or the stock repurchase program. in october 2014 and july 2015, the board authorized a $1.3 billion and $500.0 million increase, respectively, to the stock repurchase program for a total of $3.9 billion. as of december 31, 2016, there was $219.7 million of authorized funds remaining under the stock repurchase program. in february 2017, the board approved an incremental $500.0 million stock repurchase authorization under the stock repurchase program.

_______________________________
(*)   as part of the stock repurchase program, we entered into two separate accelerated share repurchase agreements, or collectively, the asr, with two financial institutions to repurchase $1.2 billion of our common stock. we made an up-front payment of $1.2 billion pursuant to the asr to repurchase our common stock. the aggregate number of shares ultimately purchased was determined based on a volume weighted average repurchase price, less an agreed upon discount. the shares received with respect to the asr have been retired. retired shares return to authorized but unissued shares of common stock.
future stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program will be subject to a review of the circumstances at that time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements.
in 2016 and 2015, we paid cash dividends of $0.10 per share each quarter, totaling $152.5 million and $156.3 million per annum, respectively. the declaration and amount of any future cash dividends are at the discretion of the board of directors, or an authorized committee thereof, and will depend on our financial performance, economic outlook, and any other relevant considerations.
we completed our full commitment to return $4.1 billion of capital, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, to stockholders by the end of 2016. beginning in 2017, we intend to return approximately 50% of annual free cash flow to our stockholders, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends. free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.
deferred revenue deferred product revenue represents unrecognized revenue related to shipments to distributors that have not sold through to end-users, undelivered product commitments, and other shipments that have not met all revenue recognition criteria. deferred product revenue is recorded net of the related costs of product revenue. deferred service revenue represents customer payments made in advance for services, which include technical support, hardware and software maintenance, professional services, and training.
the following table summarizes our deferred product and service revenues (in millions):

total deferred revenue increased by $313.0 million to $1,481.1 million as of december 31, 2016, compared to $1,168.1 million as of december 31, 2015, primarily due to (1) an increase in deferred service revenue of $230.4 million driven by an increase in multi-year support agreements, which are billed in advance, and (2) an increase in product deferred revenue primarily due to higher deferrals related to subscription and software revenue arrangements and other shipments that have not met all revenue recognition criteria. in circumstances when costs are deferred, deferred product revenue is recorded net of the related costs of product revenue.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in item 303 (a)(4)(ii) of sec regulation s-k. it is not our business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. however, in the normal course of business, we enter into contracts consisting of guarantees of product and service performance, standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities and insurance programs. see guarantees below for additional information regarding our guarantees.
contractual obligations our principal commitments consist of obligations outstanding under operating leases, purchase commitments, debt, and other contractual obligations. the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of december 31, 2016 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in millions):

(2)   lease arrangement is related to a data center lease agreement that we entered in to on july 10, 2015. see note 16, commitments and contingencies, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further explanation on the data lease agreement.
(3)   see note 10, debt and financing, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for additional information regarding our debt.
as of december 31, 2016, we had $209.2 million included in long-term income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets for unrecognized tax positions. at this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to this amount due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. as a result, this amount is not included in the table above.
revolving credit facility on june 27, 2014, we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a five year $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, with an option to increase the amount of the credit facility by up to an additional $200.0 million, subject to certain conditions. proceeds from borrowing made under the credit agreement may be used by us for working capital and general corporate purposes. revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until june 27, 2019, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid.
the credit agreement requires us to maintain a leverage ratio no greater than 3.0x and an interest coverage ratio no less than 3.0x during the term of the credit facility. in addition, the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict our ability and that of our subsidiaries to, among other things, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, change their accounting or reporting policies, change their business and incur subsidiary indebtedness, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type. as of december 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants in the credit agreement, and no amounts were outstanding. see note 10, debt and financing, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report.
57
guarantees we have entered into agreements with customers that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that our products solely, or in combination with other third party products, infringe the intellectual property rights of a third-party. as of december 31, 2016, we recorded $28.9 million for such indemnification obligations in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. we also have financial guarantees consisting of guarantees of product and service performance, standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities and insurance programs, and guarantees related to third-party customer-financing arrangements of $6.0 million and $15.8 million, as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, respectively.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions and investments in strategic relationships that we have made or we may make in the future. additionally, beginning in 2017 we intend to target a capital return policy of approximately 50% of annual free cash flow, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends. to the extent we repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program or pay cash dividends on our common stock, our liquidity may be impacted. as of december 31, 2016, 87% of our cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances were held outside of the u.s., which may be subject to u.s. taxes if repatriated.
in august 2016, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec enabling us to offer for sale, from time to time, an unspecified amount of securities in one or more offerings and is intended to give us flexibility to take advantage of financing opportunities as needed or deemed desirable in light of market conditions. our 2019 notes and 2024 notes were issued under an automatic shelf registration statement that we filed in august 2013 pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the sec on february 24, 2016. our 2020 notes and 2025 notes were issued under an automatic shelf registration statement pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the sec on february 26, 2015, and our $350.0 million in principal amount of our 2024 notes, which form a single series and are fully fungible with our 2024 notes issued in 2016, were issued under an automatic shelf registration statement pursuant to a prospectus filed with the sec on february 28, 2014. any offerings of securities under our automatic shelf registration statement will be made pursuant to a prospectus. in addition, our revolving credit facility will also provide additional flexibility for future liquidity needs.
we have been focused on managing our annual equity usage as a percentage of the common stock outstanding to align with peer group competitive levels and have made changes in recent years to reduce the number of shares underlying the equity awards we grant. for fiscal year 2016, we intended to target the number of shares underlying equity awards granted on an annual basis at 2.40% or less of our common stock outstanding on a pure share basis (where each option, rsu, rsa or psa granted is counted as one share, and each psa granted is counted based on target achievement). based upon shares underlying our grants to date of options, rsus, rsas, and psas, we met this target for 2016.
based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term, and long-term investments, together with cash generated from operations and access to capital markets and the revolving credit facility under the credit agreement will be sufficient to fund our operations, planned stock repurchases and dividends, and anticipated growth for at least the next twelve months. we believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures, commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations during the same period. however, our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors, including, but not limited to:
•   level and mix of our product, sales, and gross profit margins;
•   our business, product, capital expenditures and r&amp;d plans;
•   repurchases of our common stock;
•   payment of dividends;
•   incurrence and repayment of debt and related interest obligations;
•   litigation expenses, settlements, and judgments, or similar items related to resolution of tax audits;
•   volume price discounts and customer rebates;
58
•   accounts receivable levels that we maintain;
•   acquisitions and/or funding of other businesses, assets, products, or technologies;
•   changes in our compensation policies;
•   capital improvements for new and existing facilities;
•   technological advances;
•   our competitors' responses to our products and/or pricing;
•   our relationships with suppliers, partners, and customers;
•   possible future investments in raw material and finished goods inventories;
•   expenses related to future restructuring plans;
•   tax expense associated with share-based awards;
•   changes in u.s tax policy or rates;
•   issuance of share-based awards and the related payment in cash for withholding taxes in the current year and possibly during future years;
•   level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases under our equity incentive plans; and
•   general economic conditions and specific conditions in our industry and markets, including the effects of disruptions in global credit and financial markets, international conflicts, and related uncertainties.

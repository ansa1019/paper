item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein and the description of the company's business and reportable segments in item 1 above. this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements. factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" below and in "risk factors" in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k. references herein to the "company", "we", "us", or "our" refer to walgreens boots alliance, inc. and its subsidiaries from and after the effective time of the reorganization on december 31, 2014 and, prior to that time, to its predecessor walgreen co. and its subsidiaries, and in each case do not include unconsolidated partially-owned entities, except as otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires.
introduction on december 31, 2014, walgreens boots alliance, inc. ("walgreens boots alliance") became the successor to walgreen co. ("walgreens") pursuant to a merger to effect a reorganization of walgreens into a holding company structure (the "reorganization"), with walgreens boots alliance becoming the parent holding company. pursuant to the reorganization, walgreens became a wholly owned subsidiary of walgreens boots alliance, a delaware corporation formed for the purposes of the reorganization, and each issued and outstanding share of walgreens common stock converted on a one-to-one basis into walgreens boots alliance common stock. also on december 31, 2014, following the completion of the reorganization, walgreens boots alliance completed the acquisition of the remaining 55% of alliance boots gmbh ("alliance boots") that walgreens did not previously own (the "second step transaction") in exchange for £3.133 billion in cash and 144.3 million shares of walgreens boots alliance common stock. alliance boots became a consolidated subsidiary and ceased being accounted for under the equity method immediately upon completion of the second step transaction. for financial reporting and accounting purposes, walgreens boots alliance was the acquirer of alliance boots. the consolidated financial statements (and other data, such as prescriptions filled) reflect the results of operations and financial position of walgreens and its subsidiaries for periods prior to december 31, 2014 and of walgreens boots alliance and its subsidiaries for periods from and after the effective time of the reorganization on december 31, 2014.
on october 27, 2015, walgreens boots alliance entered into an agreement and plan of merger with rite aid corporation ("rite aid") and victoria merger sub, inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of walgreens boots alliance (the "merger agreement"), pursuant to which we agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to acquire rite aid, a drugstore chain in the united states with 4,550 stores in 31 states and the district of columbia as of august 27, 2016. the merger agreement was approved by rite aid stockholders in february 2016. the transaction is expected to close in early calendar year 2017, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
comparability as a result of the completion of the second step transaction on december 31, 2014, there are a number of items that affect comparability of reported results. prior to december 31, 2014, our operations were within one reportable segment that included the results of the retail pharmacy usa division and corporate costs, along with the full consolidated results of walgreens boots alliance development gmbh ("wbad"), a global sourcing enterprise formed by walgreens and alliance boots, and equity earnings from alliance boots. following the completion of the reorganization and the second step transaction on december 31, 2014, we now report results in three segments. segmental reporting includes the allocation of synergy benefits, including wbad's results, and the combined corporate costs for periods subsequent to december 31, 2014. we have determined that it is impracticable to allocate historical results to the current segmental presentation. accordingly, our retail pharmacy usa segment results for periods prior to december 31, 2014 include all corporate costs of walgreens, the full consolidated results of wbad and equity income from walgreens' pre-merger 45% interest in alliance boots.
the completion of the second step transaction on december 31, 2014 also means that results for the twelve month period ended august 31, 2016 include the results of alliance boots on a fully consolidated basis, while the twelve month period ended august 31, 2015 includes the results of alliance boots for eight months (january through august 2015) on a fully consolidated basis and as equity income from walgreens' pre-merger 45% interest in alliance boots for four months (september through december 2014).
- 32 -
twelve month period-over-period comparisons of results require consideration of the foregoing factors and are not directly comparable.
in addition, our sales results are affected by a number of factors, including our sales performance during holiday periods and during the cough, cold and flu season; foreign currency fluctuations; significant weather conditions; timing of our own or competitor discount programs and pricing actions; levels of reimbursement from governmental agencies and other third party payers; and general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate.
to improve comparability, certain classification changes have been made to prior period sales, cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. this change has no impact on operating income.
amerisourcebergen corporation relationship in march 2013, walgreens, alliance boots and amerisourcebergen announced various agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between walgreens and amerisourcebergen pursuant to which branded and generic pharmaceutical products are sourced from amerisourcebergen in the united states and an agreement which provides amerisourcebergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through wbad. in may 2016, certain of these agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026.
in addition, in march 2013, walgreens, alliance boots and amerisourcebergen entered into agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in amerisourcebergen over time through open market purchases and pursuant to warrants to acquire amerisourcebergen common stock and gain associated representation on amerisourcebergen's board of directors in certain circumstances. please refer to our form 8-k filed on march 20, 2013 for more detailed information regarding these agreements and arrangements.
on march 18, 2016, we exercised warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of amerisourcebergen common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.17 billion. on august 25, 2016, we exercised additional warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of amerisourcebergen common stock at an exercise price of $52.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.19 billion. as of august 31, 2016 we owned 56,854,867 amerisourcebergen common shares representing approximately 24% of the outstanding amerisourcebergen common stock and had designated one member of amerisourcebergen's board of directors. as of august 31, 2016, we can acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 amerisourcebergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of amerisourcebergen's board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. the amount of permitted open market purchases is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances.
effective march 18, 2016, we account for our investment in amerisourcebergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings attributable to our investment being classified within the operating income of our pharmaceutical wholesale segment. see note 5, equity method investments, to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information. due to the march 18, 2016 effective date and the two-month reporting lag, our results for the 12 month period ended august 31, 2016 include approximately three and a half months of equity method income relating to our investment in amerisourcebergen. similarly, due to the timing of the transaction and the two month reporting lag, our results for the fiscal quarter ended november 30, 2016 will include approximately five weeks of equity income reflecting our increased ownership following the exercise on august 25, 2016 of the second tranche of warrants.
restructuring programs on april 8, 2015, the walgreens boots alliance board of directors approved a plan to implement a new restructuring program (the "cost transformation program") as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. the cost transformation program implements and builds on the planned three-year, $1.0 billion cost-reduction initiative previously announced by walgreens on august 6, 2014 and includes a number of elements designed to help achieve profitable growth through increased cost efficiencies. we have identified additional opportunities for cost savings that increase the total expected cost savings of the cost transformation program by $500 million to a projected $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2017. significant areas of focus include plans to close approximately 200 stores across the u.s.; reorganize divisional and field operations; drive operating efficiencies; and streamline information technology and other functions. the actions under the cost transformation program focus primarily on our retail pharmacy usa segment, and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2017.
- 33 -
as of the date of this report, the company estimates that the cost transformation program will recognize cumulative pre-tax charges to our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america ("gaap") of between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion, which  is $300 million lower than the previously estimated range of pre-tax charges at the time the cost transformation program was launched), including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate payments, asset impairments and employee termination and other business transition and exit costs. as of the date of this report, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of between $425 million and $500 million for real estate costs, including lease obligations (net of estimated sublease income); between $525 million and $575 million for asset impairment charges relating primarily to asset write-offs from store closures, information technology, inventory and other non-operational real estate asset write-offs; and between $350 million and $425 million for employee severance and other business transition and exit costs. we estimate that approximately 60% of the cumulative pre-tax charges will result in cash expenditures over time, primarily related to historical and future lease and other real estate payments and employee separation costs. see note 3, restructuring, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. the actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. see "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" below.

walgreens boots alliance results of operations fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
fiscal 2016 net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance decreased 1.1 percent to $4.2 billion, while diluted net earnings per share decreased 4.5 percent to $3.82 compared with the prior year. the decreases reflect fluctuations in the fair value adjustments of the company's amerisourcebergen warrants and the prior year gain on the previously held equity interest in alliance boots, which was largely offset by the inclusion of alliance boots consolidated results for the entire period and an increase in operating income at retail pharmacy usa.
other income (expense) for fiscal 2016 was an expense of $261 million as compared to income of $685 million in fiscal 2015. the change in fair value of our amerisourcebergen warrants resulted in a loss of $546 million for fiscal 2016, as compared to income of $759 million for fiscal 2015. additionally, we recognized income of $268 million for fiscal year ended 2016 related to the change in accounting method for our investment in amerisourcebergen.
interest was a net expense of $596 million and $605 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. fiscal 2016 included interest expense on notes issued during june 2016. fiscal 2015 included interest expense of $99 million related to the repayment of a portion of our long-term debt in advance of its maturity.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 and 2015 was 19.4% and 19.9%, respectively. the net decrease in the effective tax rate is attributable to several factors.  first, our 2016 effective tax rate benefited from having a full-year of foreign sourced pre-tax earnings taxed at lower rates as compared to 2015, when the company had only eight months of those earnings after the second step transaction.  further, in 2016 our domestic pre-tax earnings were reduced as a result of the amerisourcebergen warrants then held by the company.  in addition, during 2016 the company benefitted from enacted tax law changes (tax rate reductions) in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions, most notably the united kingdom, which generated a $178 million tax benefit.  the company also had fewer non-deductible expenses in 2016 as compared to 2015.  these items were partly offset by the facts that in 2015 the company had a non-taxable gain on its previously held equity investment in alliance boots and recognized the benefit of a capital loss deferred tax asset, neither of which recurred in 2016.
walgreens boots alliance adjusted diluted net earnings per share (non-gaap measure)
adjusted net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance in fiscal 2016 increased 22.6 percent to $5.0 billion compared with the prior year. adjusted diluted net earnings per share in the fiscal year increased 18.3 percent to $4.59 compared with the prior year. the increase in adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to inclusion of alliance boots consolidated results for the entire period and an increase in operating income at retail pharmacy usa. see "--non-gaap measures" below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure.
fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014
our results for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 were primarily impacted by the second step transaction which resulted in the full consolidation of alliance boots results of operations beginning december 31, 2014. for fiscal 2015, the full consolidation of alliance boots operations increased our sales by 29.4%, gross profit by 22.9%, selling general and administrative expenses by 23.1% and operating income by 18.5%, each as compared to fiscal 2014. see "--comparability" above.
- 35 -
net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance, inc. for fiscal 2015 were $4.2 billion, or $4.00 per share on a diluted basis as compared to $1.9 billion, or $2.00 per share on a diluted basis in fiscal 2014. the increase in diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, was primarily attributable to the full consolidation of alliance boots operations from january through august 2015, a gain on our 45% previously held equity interest in alliance boots, increased sales in our retail pharmacy usa division, increased income from our warrants to acquire amerisourcebergen common stock and a lower effective income tax rate. these increases were partially offset by lower retail pharmacy usa gross margins and a higher interest expense.
as a result of acquiring the remaining 55% interest in alliance boots on december 31, 2014, our previously held 45% interest was remeasured to fair value, resulting in a gain of $563 million in fiscal 2015. the fair value of the previously held equity interest in alliance boots was determined using the income approach methodology. the fair value measurement of the previously held equity interest is based on significant inputs not observable in the market. the fair value estimates for the previously held equity interest are based on (a) projected discounted cash flows, (b) historical and projected financial information, and (c) synergies including cost savings, as relevant, that market participants would consider when estimating the fair value of the previously held equity interest in alliance boots. see note 7. acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
other income (expense) for fiscal 2015 was income of $685 million as compared to expense of $481 million in fiscal 2014. the change in fair value of our amerisourcebergen warrants resulted in recording income of $759 million and $366 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increase in fair value was primarily attributed to the change in the price of amerisourcebergen's common stock. in addition, we recorded $20 million and $19 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively, of other income relating to the amortization of the deferred credit associated with the initial value of the walgreens warrants. we have also recorded a loss of $94 million in fiscal 2015 on derivative contracts that were not designated as accounting hedges. the losses primarily relate to foreign currency forward contracts entered into in consideration of the delivery of foreign cash consideration related to the second step transaction. fiscal 2014 results also included a loss of $866 million related to the alliance boots call option. upon the amendment and immediate exercise of the call option to acquire the remaining 55% ownership of alliance boots, we were required to compare the fair value of the amended option with the book value of the original option. the fair value of the amended option was estimated to be zero based on its valuation as a financial instrument without regard for its strategic value. the reduction in value was primarily due to the shorter duration of the amended option and the appreciation since the original valuation in the price of walgreens stock used as partial consideration for the purchase of the remaining 55% ownership interest in alliance boots.
interest was a net expense of $605 million and $156 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increase in fiscal 2015 interest expense is primarily due to the notes we issued to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable in connection with the second step transaction and to subsequently refinance substantially all of alliance boots' outstanding borrowings following completion of the second step transaction. additionally, in fiscal 2015 we repaid a portion of our long-term debt in advance of its maturity resulting in additional net interest expense of $99 million.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 and 2014 was 19.9% and 42.9%, respectively. the decrease in the fiscal 2015 effective tax rate as compared to fiscal 2014 is primarily attributable to recording discrete tax benefits related to previously unrecognized capital loss deferred tax assets as a result of recognizing capital gain income from fiscal 2015 and anticipated future period sale-leaseback transactions. in addition, as a result of our acquisition of the remaining 55% interest in alliance boots that we did not previously own, our annual effective tax rate decreased due to incremental foreign source income taxed at lower rates and additional favorable permanent book-tax differences. also as a result of the acquisition, we recognized a non-recurring tax benefit that also lowered our annual effective tax rate. in addition, we recognized other, net discrete tax benefits in the current fiscal year.

results of operations by segment retail pharmacy usa as a result of the completion of the second step transaction, the company ceased recording equity earnings in alliance boots as of december 31, 2014. as such, the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015 includes equity income from walgreens' pre-merger 45% interest in alliance boots for four months (september through december 2014).

(2)   includes immunizations.

(3)   includes the adjustment to convert prescriptions greater than 84 days to the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions. this adjustment reflects the fact that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription.

(5)   comparable stores are defined as those that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days and without a major remodel or subject to a natural disaster in the past twelve months. relocated and acquired stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after the relocation or acquisition. the method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. as a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers' methods.

sales fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
the retail pharmacy usa division's sales for fiscal 2016 increased by 3.5% to $83.8 billion. sales increased primarily due to higher comparable store sales, which were up 3.8% in fiscal 2016 driven by growth in medicare part d prescriptions, partially offset by the impact from the sale of a majority interest in our infusion business in fiscal 2015. we operated 8,184 locations (8,175 drugstores) as of august 31, 2016, compared to 8,182 locations (8,173 drugstores) a year earlier.

gross margin as a percent of sales was 26.6% in fiscal 2016 compared to 26.9% in fiscal 2015. pharmacy margins were negatively impacted in the current fiscal year by lower third-party reimbursements. the decrease in pharmacy margins was partially offset by the favorable impact of procurement efficiencies. retail margins were negatively impacted in the current period primarily from performance in seasonal, consumables and general merchandise categories, partially offset by performance in health and wellness, beauty and photo categories.
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 21.4% in fiscal 2016 compared to 22.5% in fiscal 2015. as a percentage of sales, expenses in the current period were lower primarily due to increased efficiencies and cost controls associated with the cost transformation program.
adjusted operating income (non-gaap measure) fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
retail pharmacy usa division's adjusted operating income for fiscal 2016 increased 5.1% to $5.4 billion. the increase is primarily due to higher pharmacy volume and lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales. see "--non-gaap measures" below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure.

operating income fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014
retail pharmacy usa division's operating income for fiscal 2015 decreased 7.2% to $3.9 billion. the decrease is primarily due to having equity earnings in alliance boots for four months in the current year versus twelve months in the comparable period and current year costs related to the cost transformation program.
gross margin as a percent of sales was 26.9% in fiscal 2015 compared to 28.2% in fiscal 2014. pharmacy margins were negatively impacted in the current fiscal year by lower third-party reimbursements; an increase in medicare part d mix; the strategy to continue driving 90-day prescriptions at retail; and the mix of specialty drugs, which carry a lower margin percentage. the decrease in pharmacy margins was partially offset by additional brand-to-generic drug conversions compared with the prior fiscal year. retail margins were positively impacted in fiscal 2015 primarily from the non-prescription drug, beauty and beverage and snack categories partially offset by the electronics category.
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 22.5% in fiscal 2015 compared to 23.6% in fiscal 2014. as a percentage of sales, expenses in fiscal 2015 were lower primarily due to store labor efficiencies partially offset by higher costs related to the cost transformation program.
adjusted operating income (non-gaap measure) fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014
retail pharmacy usa division's adjusted operating income for fiscal 2015 increased 4.8% to $5.1 billion. the increase is primarily due to higher sales and lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales partially offset by having four months of equity earnings in alliance boots in fiscal 2015 versus twelve months in fiscal 2014 and lower gross margins. see "--non-gaap measures" below for reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure.
retail pharmacy international the businesses included in our retail pharmacy international division were acquired as part of the second step transaction. the retail pharmacy international division's results, including the increases in sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses and operating income for fiscal 2016 as compared to the comparable prior year was primarily impacted by the second step transaction, which resulted in the full consolidation of alliance boots results of operations beginning december 31, 2014. accordingly, the results for this segment for fiscal 2016 include the results of alliance boots on a fully consolidated basis, while fiscal 2015 results include only eight months (january through august 2015) on a fully consolidated basis, and such results are not directly comparable. results include the effects of foreign currency exchange rates, including the british pound, euro, chilean peso and mexican peso. to improve comparability, certain classification changes have been made to prior period results. this change has no impact on operating income. see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk for further information on currency risk.

pending rite aid transaction. the cash consideration payable to rite aid stockholders pursuant to the merger agreement described under "introduction" above is expected to be financed with a combination of cash on hand and debt financing. in connection with the merger agreement, walgreens boots alliance entered into a bridge facility commitment letter (as amended and restated, the "commitment letter") with ubs securities llc and ubs ag, stamford branch for a $12.8 billion senior unsecured bridge facility.

in assessing our credit strength, each rating agency consider various factors including our business model, capital structure, financial policies and financial performance. there can be no assurance that any particular rating will be assigned or maintained. our credit ratings impact our borrowing costs, access to capital markets and operating lease costs. the rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our debt securities or commercial paper. each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
pursuant to our arrangements with amerisourcebergen, we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in amerisourcebergen over time as described under "--amerisourcebergen corporation relationship" above. as of august 31, 2016, the company owned 56,854,867 amerisourcebergen common shares representing approximately 24% of the outstanding amerisourcebergen common stock. this includes a total of approximately 11.5 million shares of amerisourcebergen that we purchased in the open market. share purchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions or pursuant to instruments and plans complying with rule 10b5-1. our ability to invest in equity in amerisourcebergen above certain thresholds is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals.
on march 18, 2016, we exercised warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of amerisourcebergen common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.17 billion. on august 25, 2016, we exercised additional warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of amerisourcebergen common stock at an exercise price of $52.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.19 billion. the transactions were funded using existing cash on hand. see note 5, equity method investments, to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information.
we believe that cash flow from operations, availability under our existing credit facilities and arrangements, current cash and investment balances and our ability to obtain other financing, if necessary, will provide adequate cash funds for our foreseeable working capital needs, capital expenditures at existing facilities, dividend payments and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. our cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. the timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that we may complete may also impact our cash requirements.
see item 7a (qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk) below for a discussion of certain financing and market risks.
commitments and contingencies the information set forth in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k is incorporated herein by reference.
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and include amounts based on management's prudent judgments and estimates. actual results may differ from these estimates. management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. to the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the statement of earnings and corresponding balance sheet accounts would be necessary. these adjustments would be made in future periods. some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, vendor allowances, liability for closed locations, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes. we use the following methods to determine our estimates:
business combinations - we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. the determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.
for intangible assets, we generally use the income approach to determine fair value. the income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: discount rates, terminal growth rates, royalty rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. the discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections.
- 48 -
although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.
judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset's useful life.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment - goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. as part of our impairment analysis for each reporting unit, we determine fair value for each reporting unit. this determination includes estimating the fair value using both the income and market approaches. the income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. the market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping.
the determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. the allocation requires analysis to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities including purchased prescription files, customer relationships, pharmacy licenses and trade names. although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both.
we also compared the sum of the estimated fair values of the reporting units to the company's fair value as implied by the market value of the company's equity and debt securities. this comparison indicated that, in total, our assumptions and estimates were reasonable. however, future declines in the overall market value of the company's equity and debt securities may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.
our reporting units' fair values exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 17% to more than 116%. see note 8, goodwill and other intangible assets, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
our indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value is estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, availability of market information as well as our profitability.
vendor allowances - vendor allowances are principally received as a result of purchases, sales or promotion of vendors' products. allowances are generally recorded as a reduction of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold. those allowances received for promoting vendors' products are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses to the extent of advertising incurred, with the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs.
liability for closed locations - the liability is based on the present value of future rent obligations and other related costs (net of estimated sublease rent) to the first lease option date.
- 49 -
cost of sales and inventory - cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and services sold, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence, manufacturing costs, certain direct product design and development costs and supplier rebates. in addition to product costs, cost of sales includes manufacturing costs, warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances. cost of sales for our retail pharmacy usa segment is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts. inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the last-in, first-out ("lifo") method for the retail pharmacy usa segment and on a first-in first-out ("fifo") basis for inventory in the retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale segments except for retail inventory in the retail pharmacy international segment, which is valued using the retail method.
equity method investments - we use the equity method to account for investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. our proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings. judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material purchase and sale transactions.
pension and postretirement benefits - we have various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of our foreign employees. we also have postretirement healthcare plans that cover qualifying domestic employees. eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans varies depending on participants' status, date of hire and or length of service. our pension and postretirement expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating those amounts. these assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term rate of return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. in determining our long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, we consider both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long-term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio. a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on our projected benefit obligation and pension expense. a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of $440 million to our pension benefit obligation. a 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase our pension expense by $24 million.
our policy is to fund our pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. our postretirement healthcare plans are not funded.
income taxes - we are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. u.s. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. in evaluating the tax benefits associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. adjustments are made to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other long-term liabilities and current income taxes on our consolidated balance sheets and in income tax provision in our consolidated statements of earnings.
in determining our provision for income taxes, we use income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and enacted statutory income tax rates. the provision for income taxes rate also reflects our assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the united states. discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.

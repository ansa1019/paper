item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.
forward-looking statements the annual reports on form 10-k, including the documents incorporated by reference, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. we intend these forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and are including this statement for purposes of complying with those safe harbor provisions. such statements are contained principally, but not only, under the captions "business-business and growth strategies," "risk factors" and "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." we caution investors that any such forward-looking statements are based on beliefs and on assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. when used, the words "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "might," "plan," "project," "result," "should," "will" and similar expressions which do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward-looking statements. such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected by the forward-looking statements. we caution you that, while forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on forward-looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends.
some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:
•   if there is a negative change in the economy, including, but not limited to, a reversal of current job growth trends and an increase in unemployment, it could have a negative effect on the following, among other things:
•   the fundamentals of our business, including overall market occupancy, tenant space utilization, and rental rates;
•   the financial condition of our tenants, many of which are financial, legal, media/telecommunication, technology and other professional firms, our lenders, counterparties to our derivative financial instruments and institutions that hold our cash balances and short-term investments, which may expose us to increased risks of default by these parties; and
•   the value of our real estate assets, which may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or obtain or maintain debt financing secured by our properties or on an unsecured basis;
•   volatile or adverse global economic and political conditions, and dislocations in the credit markets could adversely affect our access to cost-effective capital and have a resulting material adverse effect on our business opportunities, results of operations and financial condition;
•   general risks affecting the real estate industry (including, without limitation, the inability to enter into or renew leases, tenant space utilization, dependence on tenants' financial condition, and competition from other developers, owners and operators of real estate);
•   failure to manage effectively our growth and expansion into new markets and sub-markets or to integrate acquisitions and developments successfully;
•   the ability of our joint venture partners to satisfy their obligations;
•   risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including, without limitation, construction delays, increased construction costs, cost overruns, inability to obtain necessary permits, tenant accounting considerations that may result in negotiated lease provisions that limit a tenant's liability during construction, and public opposition to such activities);
•   risks associated with the availability and terms of financing and the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments or refinance existing indebtedness, including the impact of higher interest rates on the cost and/or availability of financing;
•   risks associated with forward interest rate contracts and the effectiveness of such arrangements;
•   risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies, increases in interest rates, and volatility in the securities markets;
44
•   risks associated with actual or threatened terrorist attacks;
•   costs of compliance with the americans with disabilities act and other similar laws;
•   potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination;
•   risks associated with security breaches through cyber attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (it) networks and related systems, which support our operations and our buildings;
•   risks associated with bxp's potential failure to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended;
•   possible adverse changes in tax and environmental laws;
•   the impact of newly adopted accounting principles on our accounting policies and on period-to-period comparisons of financial results;
•   risks associated with possible state and local tax audits; and
•   risks associated with our dependence on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed.
the risks set forth above are not exhaustive. other sections of this report, including "part i, item 1a-risk factors," include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. investors should also refer to our quarterly reports on form 10-q for future periods and current reports on form 8-k as we file them with the sec, and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through current reports on form 8-k or otherwise, for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. we expressly disclaim any responsibility to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, future events, or otherwise, and you should not rely upon these forward-looking statements after the date of this report.
overview bxp is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed reit and one of the largest owners, managers and developers of primarily class a office properties in the united states. bplp is the entity through which bxp conducts substantially all of its business and owns (either directly or through subsidiaries) substantially all of its assets. our properties are concentrated in five markets - boston, los angeles, new york, san francisco and washington, dc. we generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing class a office space to our tenants. factors we consider when we lease space include the creditworthiness of the tenant, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid at inception and throughout the lease term, the costs of tenant improvements and other landlord concessions, current and anticipated operating costs and real estate taxes, current and anticipated vacancy, current and anticipated future demand for office space and general economic factors.
our core strategy has always been to develop, acquire and operate properties in supply-constrained markets with high barriers-to-entry and to focus on executing long-term leases with financially strong tenants. historically, this combination has tended to reduce our exposure in down cycles and enhance revenues as market conditions improve. to be successful in any leasing environment, we believe all aspects of the tenant-landlord relationship must be considered. in this regard, we believe that our understanding of tenants' short- and long-term space utilization and amenity needs in the local markets in which we operate, our relationships with local brokers, our reputation as a premier developer, owner and operator of class a office properties, our financial strength and our ability to maintain high building standards provide us with a competitive advantage.
outlook economic growth in the united states continues, despite decelerating in the fourth quarter of 2016 as gross domestic product decreased from an annual rate of 3.5% for the third quarter of 2016 to 1.9% for the fourth quarter of 2016, according to initial estimates. employment continues to improve gradually with approximately 156,000 jobs created in december 2016 and the unemployment rate remained stable at 4.7%. we believe employment indicators, which are driving improving office market fundamentals in our markets, combined with the relatively low interest rate environment and the prospect for fiscal stimulus, provide confidence for continued growth.

in this economic climate, we continue to focus on (1) ensuring tenant satisfaction throughout our portfolio; (2) leasing available space in our in-service and development properties, as well as focusing on future large lease expirations; (3) completing the construction of our properties under development; (4) redeveloping and repositioning several key properties to increase future revenues and asset values, despite the adverse impact on near-term revenue; (5) maintaining discipline in our underwriting of investment opportunities by (i) seeking pre-leasing commitments to begin new construction and (ii) targeting acquisition activity in non-stabilized assets near innovation centers where we see the strongest prospects for overall growth and our operational expertise can create value; and (6) maintaining our conservative balance sheet by managing our near-term debt maturities.
during the fourth quarter of 2016, we signed leases across our portfolio totaling approximately 3.0 million square feet, which is our all-time quarterly record, and commenced revenue recognition on approximately 1.1 million square feet of leases in second generation space. of these leases in second generation space, approximately 654,000 square feet have been vacant for less than one year and provide an average increase in net rental obligation of more than 39.0%, demonstrating the strong internal growth opportunities embedded in our portfolio. the overall occupancy of our in-service properties increased from 89.6% at september 30, 2016 to 90.2% at december 31, 2016 due mainly to leasing at the recently acquired colorado center in santa monica, california, which improved to 79.1% leased as of december 31, 2016 from 65.5% at september 30, 2016.
our investment strategy remains largely unchanged. other than possible acquisitions of value-add assets, such as those requiring lease-up or repositioning like colorado center, we intend to continue to invest primarily in higher yielding new developments with significant pre-leasing commitments and redevelopment opportunities rather than lower yielding acquisitions of stabilized assets for which demand and pricing remains strong. our current development pipeline consists of eight development/redevelopment projects representing approximately 4.0 million net rentable square feet and an estimated total investment of approximately $2.3 billion, of which approximately $1.0 billion remains to be spent. as of february 22, 2017, approximately 50% of the commercial space in these development projects is pre-leased. in addition, we have begun, or will soon begin, the repositioning of several of our properties, including 159 east 53rd street (the former low-rise portion of 601 lexington avenue), the retail and plaza at 767 fifth avenue and 399 park avenue in new york city; 100 federal street and the prudential center (retail shops) in boston, massachusetts; 191 spring street in lexington, massachusetts; and 1330 connecticut avenue and metropolitan square in washington, dc. these projects require significant capital expenditures and, in some cases, necessitate that space is vacated for an extended period of time.
we also have significant land holdings and opportunities to increase square footage density that we intend to move through the design and permitting processes and add selectively to our development/redevelopment pipeline, including some developments that may commence in 2017.
during the fourth quarter of 2016, we raised approximately $200 million of incremental capital from the sale of a partial interest in our metropolitan square joint venture and two secured financings at joint venture assets. given the relatively low interest rates currently available to us in the debt markets, we expect to enhance our liquidity to provide sufficient capacity to fund our remaining capital requirements for existing development projects and pursue attractive additional investment opportunities. depending on the type and timing of financing, raising capital may result in us carrying additional cash and cash equivalents pending our use of the proceeds.
the same factors that create challenges to acquiring assets present opportunities for us to continue to review our portfolio to identify properties that may no longer fit within our portfolio strategy or could attract premium pricing in the current market environment as potential sales candidates. we expect to continue to sell non-core assets in 2017, subject to market conditions.
a brief overview of each of our markets follows.
boston the greater boston region continues to attract life science and established technology companies, as well as start-up technology and maker organizations. our east cambridge properties are outperforming the overall submarket at approximately 97.9% occupancy. during the fourth quarter of 2016, we entered into a 476,500 square foot lease with a tenant for our 145 broadway property at kendall center in cambridge. 145 broadway currently consists of an approximately 80,000 net rentable square foot class a office property that will be demolished and redeveloped into an approximately 486,000 net rentable square foot class a office property including approximately 9,500 net rentable square feet of retail space. the commencement of the redevelopment project is subject to the receipt of the remaining necessary approvals, and we currently expect to begin the project in the second quarter of 2017 with the relocation of an existing tenant to another property within our portfolio. we expect the building will be available for occupancy by the new tenant during the fourth quarter of 2019.  there can be no assurance that the project will commence or that the building will be available for occupancy on the anticipated schedule or at all.

our suburban waltham/lexington submarket continues to strengthen due to the organic growth of our existing tenant base and other tenants in the market looking for space to accommodate their expanding workforces. in the fourth quarter of 2016, we completed approximately 300,000 square feet of leases. we commenced the redevelopment of 191 spring street, an approximately 160,000 square foot building, and signed a lease with a lead tenant for approximately 80,000 square feet. in addition, on october 1, 2016, a joint venture in which we have a 50% interest completed and fully placed in-service 1265 main street, a class a office building with approximately 115,000 net rentable feet located in waltham, massachusetts. the property is 100% leased.
the boston central business district ("cbd") submarket continues to be driven by lease-expirations from traditional financial and professional services tenants and a steady flow of new technology companies moving into the cbd. during the fourth quarter of 2016, we leased approximately 480,000 square feet and our boston cbd portfolio was 90.3% leased at december 31, 2016. our largest vacancy exposure remains at 200 clarendon street where we have approximately 250,000 square feet available. activity, particularly at the low-rise portion of the building has increased as evidenced by recently signed leases for approximately 90,000 square feet with new tenants. in addition, the leases signed in the fourth quarter of 2016 includes 64,000 square feet at the recently completed 888 boylston street, which brings the office building to 89% leased.
los angeles activity at our colorado center joint venture asset in west los angeles ("la") is robust. during the fourth quarter of 2016, we signed leases for approximately 220,000 of the 350,000 square feet of availability, and we extended leases for another approximately 190,000 square feet, driving the percentage leased from 65.5% to 87.3%, including leases that have not yet commenced, in just the first six months of our ownership. we are committed to growing our presence and portfolio in la and expect to continue to underwrite investment opportunities in this market.
new york our overall expectations for the midtown manhattan office market and the leasing activity in our portfolio have been generally consistent for the past two years. new supply continues to come into the market in the form of new deliveries and large lease expirations. as a result, tenants have increasing options and therefore we are not anticipating significant growth in office rents and are witnessing higher tenant concessions. our new york city portfolio remains well leased at 94.2% with 7.8% rollover in 2017. in the fourth quarter of 2016, we completed approximately 551,000 square feet of leases at our properties in the new york region, including an approximately 77,000 square foot lease extension and expansion with apple at 767 fifth avenue.
san francisco although leasing velocity in the san francisco cbd has moderated from the peak levels we saw in 2014 and early 2015, the cbd leasing market remains healthy and among the strongest markets in the united states. we continue to benefit from this strength as evidenced by the approximately 160,000 square feet of second generation leases executed during the fourth quarter of 2016, which have been vacant for less than one year and provide an average increase in net rental obligation of approximately 90.0%.
our near-term leasing focus remains the lease-up of salesforce tower, where we are 62% leased and anticipate signing an additional 100,000 square foot with a tenant in the near term. construction of salesforce tower is at its full height of 61 floors and is now the tallest building in the city. prospective tenants may now tour the available floors and experience the breadth of vision glass, column free floors and floor heights and views. tour activity remains strong and we expect the first tenants to occupy this building in the fourth quarter of 2017.
washington, dc overall market conditions in the washington cbd have not changed in any meaningful way over the past few quarters. leasing activity remains very competitive primarily because there has been no significant increase in demand. in this environment we are pleased that during the fourth quarter of 2016 we signed leases for approximately 422,000 square feet including a 206,000 square foot, 15-year renewal with a gsa tenant.
in october 2016, we completed the sale of a portion of our 51% interest in metropolitan square. following the transaction, we continue to own a 20% interest and have retained responsibility for property management and leasing. the joint venture plans to reposition this building, including updates to its lobby and common areas, which it believes will enhance the marketability and value of the building.

our reston town center properties are approximately 97.8% leased and continue to command a premium compared to the rents realized in nearby submarkets.

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, or gaap, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. from time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.
real estate upon acquisitions of real estate that constitutes a business, which includes the consolidation of previously unconsolidated joint ventures, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets, (including land, buildings, tenant improvements, "above-" and "below-market" leases, leasing and assumed financing origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities) and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land and buildings as if vacant. we assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate, as well as available market information. estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions.
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. we also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants' credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial.
we record acquired "above-" and "below-market" leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. acquired "above-" and "below-market" lease values have been reflected within prepaid expenses and other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets. other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. in estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. in estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.
management reviews its long-lived assets for impairment every quarter and when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value. an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding anticipated hold periods, future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. because cash flows on properties considered to be "long-lived assets to be held and used" are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. if our hold strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. if we determine that an impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value, less cost to sell.
guidance in accounting standards codification ("asc") 360 "property plant and equipment" ("asc 360") requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold, or otherwise qualify as "held for sale," be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale. the components of the property's net income that is

reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain (or loss) upon the disposition of the property held for sale, operating results, depreciation and interest expense (if the property is subject to a secured loan). we generally consider assets to be "held for sale" when the transaction has been approved by the board of directors of bxp, or a committee thereof, and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale, such that a sale of the property within one year is considered probable. following the classification of a property as "held for sale," no further depreciation is recorded on the assets, and the asset is written down to the lower of carrying value or fair market value, less cost to sell. on april 10, 2014, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued asu 2014-08, "reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity" ("asu 2014-08"). asu 2014-08 clarifies that discontinued operations presentation applies only to disposals representing a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results (e.g., a disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major equity method investment or other major parts of an entity). asu 2014-08 is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2014. early adoption is permitted, and we early adopted asu 2014-08 during the first quarter of 2014. our adoption of asu 2014-08 resulted in the operating results and gains on sales of real estate from operating properties sold during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 not being reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).
real estate is stated at depreciated cost. a variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. the cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. we expense costs that we incur to effect a business combination such as legal, due diligence and other closing related costs. costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized. capitalized development costs include interest, internal wages, property taxes, insurance, and other project costs incurred during the period of development. after the determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. determination of when a development project commences and capitalization begins, and when a development project is substantially complete and held available for occupancy and capitalization must cease, involves a degree of judgment. our capitalization policy on development properties is follows the guidance in asc 835-20 "capitalization of interest" and asc 970 "real estate-general." the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs.
the capitalized costs include pre-construction costs necessary to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. we begin the capitalization of costs during the pre-construction period which we define as activities that are necessary for the development of the property. we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. we cease capitalization on the portion (1) substantially completed, (2) occupied or held available for occupancy, and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction or (3) if activities necessary for the development of the property have been suspended.
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures we consolidate variable interest entities ("vies") in which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary. vies are entities in which the equity investors do not have sufficient equity at risk to finance their endeavors without additional financial support or that the holders of the equity investment at risk do not have substantive participating rights. the primary beneficiary is defined by the entity having both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities that, when taken together, most significantly impact the variable interest entity's performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive the returns from the variable interest entity that could potentially be significant to the vie. for ventures that are not vies, we consolidate entities for which we have significant decision making control over the ventures' operations. our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity involves the consideration of various factors including the form of our ownership interest, our representation in the entity's governance, the size of our investment (including loans), estimates of future cash flows, our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager and/or liquidate the venture, if applicable. our assessment of our influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements. in addition to evaluating control rights, we consolidate entities in which the outside partner has no substantive kick-out rights to remove us as the managing member.
accounts of the consolidated entity are included in our accounts and the noncontrolling interest is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of equity or in temporary equity between liabilities and equity. investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are recorded initially at cost, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on the balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset. under the equity method of accounting, our net equity investment is reflected within the consolidated balance sheets, and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the consolidated statements of
50
operations. the joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses; however, our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint venture's distribution priorities, which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds. we may account for cash distributions in excess of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture as income when we are not the general partner in a limited partnership and when we have neither the requirement nor the intent to provide financial support to the joint venture. our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for impairment periodically and we record impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair values below the carrying values has occurred and such decline is other-than-temporary. the ultimate realization of the investment in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value below the carrying value of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other-than-temporary.
to the extent that we contribute assets to a joint venture, our investment in the joint venture is recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture. to the extent that our cost basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in our share of equity in net income of the joint venture. in accordance with the provisions of asc 970-323 "investments-equity method and joint ventures" ("asc 970-323"), we will recognize gains on the contribution of real estate to joint ventures, relating solely to the outside partner's interest, to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale.
the combined summarized financial information of the unconsolidated joint ventures is disclosed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition in general, we commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use. contractual rental revenue is reported on a straight-line basis over the terms of our respective leases. we recognize rental revenue of acquired in-place "above-" and "below-market" leases at their fair values over the original term of the respective leases. accrued rental income as reported on the consolidated balance sheets represents rental income recognized in excess of rent payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, the impact of the net adjustments of rents from "above-" and "below-market" leases increased rental revenue by approximately $30.2 million. for the year ended december 31, 2016, the impact of the straight-line rent adjustment increased rental revenue by approximately $31.7 million. those amounts exclude the adjustment of rents from "above-" and "below-market" leases and straight-line income from unconsolidated joint ventures, which are disclosed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
our leasing strategy is generally to secure creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting guidelines. furthermore, following the initiation of a lease, we continue to actively monitor the tenant's creditworthiness to ensure that all tenant related assets are recorded at their realizable value. when assessing tenant credit quality, we:
•   review relevant financial information, including:
•   financial ratios;
•   net worth;
•   revenue;
•   cash flows;
•   leverage; and
•   liquidity;
•   evaluate the depth and experience of the tenant's management team; and
•   assess the strength/growth of the tenant's industry.
as a result of the underwriting process, tenants are then categorized into one of three categories:
(1)   acceptable-risk tenants;
(2)   the tenant's credit is such that we may require collateral, in which case we:
•   may require a security deposit; and/or
•   may reduce upfront tenant improvement investments; or
(3)   the tenant's credit is below our acceptable parameters.
51
we consistently monitor the credit quality of our tenant base. we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenant's inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential losses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease.
tenants are assigned a credit rating of 1 through 4. a rating of 1 represents the highest possible rating and no allowance is recorded. a rating of 4 represents the lowest credit rating, in which case we record a full reserve against the receivable and accrued rent balances. among the factors considered in determining the credit rating include:
•   payment history;
•   credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric);
•   change in tenant space needs (i.e., expansion/downsize);
•   tenant financial performance;
•   economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and
•   industry specific credit considerations.
if our estimates of collectability differ from the cash received, the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted. the average remaining term of our in-place tenant leases, including unconsolidated joint ventures, was approximately 7.3 years as of december 31, 2016. the credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants' risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants.
recoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs, are recognized as revenue in the period during which the expenses are incurred. tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with guidance in asc 605-45 "principal agent considerations" ("asc 605-45"). asc 605-45 requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis, as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk. we also receive reimbursement of payroll and payroll related costs from third parties which we reflect on a net basis.
our parking revenues are derived from leases, monthly parking and transient parking. we recognize parking revenue as earned.
our hotel revenue is derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for telephone service, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services. hotel revenue is recognized as earned.
we receive management and development fees from third parties. property management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management, and not on a straight-line basis, because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents. we record development fees as earned depending on the risk associated with each project. we recognize development fees earned from joint venture projects equal to its cost plus profit to the extent of the third party partners' ownership interest.
gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions included in asc 360-20 "real estate sales" ("asc 360-20"). the specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in asc 360-20 related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. if the sales criteria for the full accrual method are not met, we defer some or all of the gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, leasing, profit sharing, deposit, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met.
depreciation and amortization we compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight-line method based on estimated useful asset lives. we allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to its components and depreciate or amortize these assets over their useful lives. the amortization of acquired "above-" and "below-market" leases and acquired in-place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization, respectively, in the consolidated statements of operations.
fair value of financial instruments the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, escrows, receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other assets and liabilities are reasonable estimates of their fair values because of the short maturities of these instruments.
52
we follow the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements when valuing our financial instruments for disclosure purposes. bplp determine the fair value of its unsecured senior notes using market prices. the inputs used in determining the fair value of bplp's unsecured senior notes is categorized at a level 1 basis (as defined in the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures) due to the fact that we use quoted market rates to value these instruments. however, the inputs used in determining the fair value could be categorized at a level 2 basis if trading volumes are low. we determine the fair value of our mortgage notes payable using discounted cash flow analyses by discounting the spread between the future contractual interest payments and hypothetical future interest payments on mortgage debt based on current market rates for similar securities. in determining the current market rates, we add our estimates of market spreads to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our debt. the inputs used in determining the fair value of our mortgage notes payable and mezzanine notes payable are categorized at a level 3 basis (as defined in the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures) due to the fact that we consider the rates used in the valuation techniques to be unobservable inputs.
derivative instruments and hedging activities derivative instruments and hedging activities require management to make judgments on the nature of its derivatives and their effectiveness as hedges. these judgments determine if the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are reported in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of net income or as a component of comprehensive income and as a component of equity on the consolidated balance sheets. while management believes its judgments are reasonable, a change in a derivative's effectiveness as a hedge could materially affect expenses, net income and equity. we account for the effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative in other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassify the effective portion to earnings over the term that the hedged transaction affects earnings. we account for the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative directly in earnings.

at december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we owned or had interests in a portfolio of 174, 168 and 169 properties, respectively (in each case, the "total property portfolio"). as a result of changes within our total property portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period-to-period. accordingly, we do not believe that our period-to-period financial data with respect to the total property portfolio are necessarily meaningful. therefore, the comparison of operating results for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us and in-service throughout each period compared (the "same property portfolio") and the changes attributable to the properties included in the placed in-service, acquired, development or redevelopment or sold portfolios.
in our analysis of operating results, particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in-service and owned by us throughout each period presented. we refer to properties acquired or placed in-service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us and in-service through the end of the latest period presented as our same property portfolio. the same property

portfolio therefore excludes properties placed in-service, acquired or in development or redevelopment after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented.
net operating income ("noi") is a non-gaap financial measure equal to net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders, the most directly comparable gaap financial measures, plus (1) preferred dividends/distributions, noncontrolling interests, impairment loss, losses from interest rate contracts, losses from early extinguishments of debt, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, transaction costs and general and administrative expense less (2) gains on sales of real estate, gains (losses) from investments in securities, interest and other income, gain on sale of investment in unconsolidated joint venture, income from unconsolidated joint ventures and development and management services income. we use noi internally as a performance measure and believe it provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because, when compared across periods, it reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders. for example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. similarly, interest expense may be incurred at the property level even though the financing proceeds may be used at the corporate level (e.g., for other investment activity). in addition, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, depreciation and amortization may distort operating performance measures at the property level.
noi presented by us may not be comparable to noi reported by other reits or real estate companies that define noi differently. we believe that, in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, noi should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders as presented in our consolidated financial statements. noi should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders or net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders (determined in accordance with gaap) or any other gaap financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with gaap.
the gains on sales of real estate and depreciation expense may differ between bxp and bplp as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by bxp for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor op unit redemptions by bplp. this accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at bxp that was allocated to certain properties. the difference between the real estate assets of bxp as compared to bplp for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in the gains on sales of real estate and depreciation expense when those properties are sold. for additional information see the explanatory note.
comparison of the year ended december 31, 2016 to the year ended december 31, 2015
the table below shows selected operating information for the same property portfolio and the total property portfolio. the same property portfolio consists of 143 properties totaling approximately 38.4 million net rentable square feet of space, excluding unconsolidated joint ventures. the same property portfolio includes properties acquired or placed in-service on or prior to january 1, 2015 and owned and in service through december 31, 2016. the total property portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either placed in-service, acquired or in development or redevelopment after january 1, 2015 or disposed of on or prior to december 31, 2016. this table includes a reconciliation from the same property portfolio to the total property portfolio by also providing information for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 with respect to the properties which were placed in-service, acquired, in development or redevelopment or sold.

same property portfolio rental revenue rental revenue from the same property portfolio increased approximately $35.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 2015. the increase was primarily the result of an increase in revenue from our leases of approximately $38.4 million partially offset by decreases in other recoveries and parking and other income of approximately $1.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively. rental revenue from our leases increased approximately $38.4 million as a result of our average revenue per square foot increasing by approximately $1.92, contributing approximately $66.0 million partially, offset by an approximately $27.6 million decrease due to a reduction in our average occupancy from 92.0% to 91.4%.
termination income termination income increased by approximately $19.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 2015.
termination income for the year ended december 31, 2016 resulted from the termination of 35 tenants across the same property portfolio which totaled approximately $60.2 million of which approximately $58.8 million was from our new york region. on february 3, 2016, we entered into a lease termination agreement with a tenant for an approximately 85,000 square foot lease at our 250 west 55th street property located in new york city.  the lease was scheduled to expire on february 28, 2035.  in consideration for the termination of the lease, the tenant paid us approximately $45.0 million. in addition, during the year ended december 31, 2016, we received a fourth interim distribution from our unsecured creditor claim again lehman brothers, inc. of approximately $1.4 million, which leaves a remaining claim of approximately $28.0 million (see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). recently, claims of similar priority to that of our remaining claim were quoted privately reflecting a value for our remaining claim of approximately $1.5 million; however, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of additional proceeds, if any, that we may receive. the remaining approximately $12.4 million of termination income from the new york region was primarily related to negotiated early releases with three other tenants.
termination income for the year ended december 31, 2015 resulted from the termination of 32 tenants across the same property portfolio which totaled approximately $40.6 million of which approximately $32.5 million, $6.4 million, $1.2 million and $0.5 million related to early terminations in our new york, san francisco, boston and washington, dc regions, respectively. the termination income from the new york region was primarily due to distributions we received from our unsecured creditor claim against lehman brothers, inc. (see below) and our negotiated early terminations of a tenant at 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building), two tenants at 601 lexington avenue and a tenant in princeton, new jersey each in order to accommodate leasing the space to other tenants. approximately $7.0 million of our termination income for the year ended december 31, 2015 was non-cash and resulted from the acceleration of "above-" and "below-market" lease revenue and straight-line rent adjustments.
on march 11, 2015 and september 9, 2015, we received the second and third interim distributions from our unsecured creditor claim against lehman brothers, inc. aggregating approximately $8.1 million.
real estate operating expenses real estate operating expenses from the same property portfolio increased approximately $20.1 million, or 2.4%, for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 2015, due primarily to an increase of approximately $21.0 million, or 5.4%, in real estate taxes, which we primarily experienced in the new york cbd properties partially offset by a decrease in other real estate operating expenses of approximately $0.9 million, or 0.2%.

(1)   average monthly rental rates are calculated by us as rental revenue in accordance with gaap, divided by the weighted monthly average number of occupied units.
(2)   average physical occupancy is defined as the average number of occupied units divided by the total number of units, expressed as a percentage.
(3)   average economic occupancy is defined as total possible revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of total possible revenue. total possible revenue is determined by valuing average occupied units at contract rates and average vacant units at market rents. vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current market rents. by measuring vacant units at their market rents, average economic occupancy takes into account the fact that units of different sizes and locations within a residential property have
60
different economic impacts on a residential property's total possible gross revenue. market rents used by us in calculating economic occupancy are based on the current market rates set by the managers of our residential properties based on their experience in renting their residential property's units and publicly available market data. trends in market rents for a region as reported by others could vary. market rents for a period are based on the average market rents during that period and do not reflect any impact for cash concessions.
hotel net operating income net operating income for the boston marriott cambridge hotel property decreased by approximately $0.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 2015. we expect our hotel net operating income for fiscal 2017 to be between $13 million and $15 million.

development and management services development and management services income increased approximately $5.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 2015. development service income increased by approximately $2.5 million and management service income increased by approximately $3.2 million. the increase in development service income is primarily due to increases in development fees from our boston and new york unconsolidated joint ventures, as well as an increase in our san francisco third-party development fees, partially offset by a decrease in development fees from our washington, dc third-party developments and unconsolidated joint ventures. management service income increased primarily due to management fees and leasing commissions. the increase in management fees was primarily due to the fees we earned from our colorado center joint venture, which we acquired on july 1, 2016, in santa monica, california. the increase in leasing commissions was related to a commission we earned on a lease that was extended at one of our third party managed buildings in new york city. we expect our development and management services income to contribute between $27 million and $33 million for 2017.
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased approximately $8.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to an approximately $8.9 million increase in overall compensation expense. the increase in compensation expense was primarily due to the following items: (1) approximately $3.7 million related to the difference between the unrecognized expense remaining from the 2013 myltip units compared to the expense that was recognized during the year ended december 31, 2016 for the newly issued 2016 myltip units (see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements), (2) an approximately $2.9 million increase in the value of bxp's deferred compensation plan and (3) an approximately $2.3 million increase in other compensation expenses.
based on currently budgeted amounts, we expect general and administrative expenses to be between $110 million and $115 million for 2017, which would be greater than the $105.2 million for 2016. this estimate assumes a cost-of-living adjustment, projected increase in the value of bxp's deferred compensation plan and the impact of the issuance of 2017 myltip units as a long-term compensation plan in february 2017. the projected increased expense associated with the long-term compensation plan is due to the difference between the unrecognized expense remaining from the 2014 myltip units compared to the expense that would be recognized during the first year of the new long-term compensation plan.
wages directly related to the development and leasing of rental properties are not included in our operating results. these costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets and deferred charges on our consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the applicable asset. capitalized wages for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $18.3 million and $15.9 million, respectively. these costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above.

(1)   on august 19, 2016, the consolidated entity in which we have a 55% interest and that owns 601 lexington avenue located in new york city commenced the redevelopment of the six-story, low-rise office and retail building component of the complex, which will be called 159 east 53rd street. the redeveloped portion of the low-rise building will contain approximately 195,000 net rentable square feet of class a office space and approximately 25,000 net rentable square feet of retail space. we recorded approximately $47.6 million of accelerated depreciation expense for the portion of the complex to be demolished.
other income and expense items income from unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 2015, income from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased by approximately $14.7 million due primarily to an approximately $12.4 million decrease in our share of net income from 901 new york avenue in washington, dc. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we received a distribution of approximately $24.5 million, which was generated from the excess loan proceeds from the joint venture's refinancing of its mortgage loan to a new 10-year mortgage loan totaling $225.0 million. our allocation of income and distributions for the year ended december 31, 2015 was not proportionate to our nominal ownership interest as a result of the achievement of specified investment return thresholds, as provided for in the joint venture agreement. in addition, we had an approximately $4.3 million and $0.7 million decrease in our share of net income from our annapolis junction joint venture and metropolitan square joint venture, respectively. the decrease for metropolitan square is documented below under the heading "gain on sale of investment in unconsolidated joint venture." the decrease in our share of net income from the annapolis junction joint venture is primarily due to an increase in interest expense related to annapolis junction building one having an event of default and as of october 17, 2016 the property was being charged interest at the default interest rate. also, annapolis junction building seven and building eight had construction loans and, therefore, the venture capitalized the interest and did not expense it during the development period in 2015. in addition, there was an increase in depreciation and amortization expense as a result of annapolis junction building seven and building eight no longer being in development for the entire year ended december 31, 2016. these decreases were partially offset by the acquisition of colorado center located in santa monica, california and the placing in-service of 1265 main street in waltham, massachusetts (refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).
gain on sale of investment in unconsolidated joint venture on october 20, 2016, we and our partner in the unconsolidated joint venture that owns metropolitan square located in washington, dc, completed the sale of an 80% interest in the joint venture for a gross sale price of approximately $282.4 million, including the assumption by the buyer of its pro rata share of the mortgage loan collateralized by the property totaling approximately $133.4 million. in addition, the buyer agreed to assume certain unfunded leasing costs totaling approximately $14.2 million. net proceeds to us totaled approximately $58.2 million, resulting in a gain on sale of investment totaling approximately $59.4 million. prior to the sale, we owned a 51% interest and our partner owned a 49% interest in the joint venture. following the sale, we continue to own a 20% interest in the joint venture with the buyer owning the remaining 80%. metropolitan square is an approximately 607,000 net rentable square foot class a office property.
interest and other income interest and other income increased approximately $0.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to a purchase rebate program in which we participated.
gains (losses) from investments in securities gains (losses) from investments in securities for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 related to investments that we have made to reduce our market risk relating to a deferred compensation plan that we maintain for officers of bxp. under this deferred compensation plan, each officer who is eligible to participate is permitted to defer a portion of the officer's current income on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer. in order to reduce our market risk relating to this plan, we typically acquire, in a separate account that is not restricted as to its use, similar or identical investments as those selected by each officer. this enables us to generally match our liabilities to officers of bxp under the deferred compensation plan with equivalent assets and thereby limit our market risk. the performance of these investments is recorded as gains (losses) from investments in securities. during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized gains (losses) of approximately $2.3 million and $(0.7) million, respectively, on these investments. by comparison, our general and administrative expense increased (decreased) by approximately $2.3 million and $(0.6) million during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as a result of increases (decreases) in our liability under our deferred compensation plan that were associated with the performance of the specific investments selected by officers of bxp participating in the plan.

_______________
(1)   the related interest expense from the outside members' notes payable totaled approximately $34.3 million and $30.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. these amounts are allocated to the outside joint venture partners as an adjustment to noncontrolling interests in property partnerships in our consolidated statements of operations.
(2)   includes the repayment of kingstowne two and kingstowne retail, fountain square, embarcadero center four and 599 lexington avenue.
(3)   the increase was primarily due to the commencement and continuation of several development projects. for a list of development projects refer to "liquidity and capital resources" within "item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
interest expense directly related to the development of rental properties is not included in our operating results. these costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate. as properties are placed in-service, we cease capitalizing interest and interest is then expensed. interest capitalized for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $39.2 million and $34.2 million, respectively. these costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above.
we estimate interest expense will be approximately $378 million to $391 million for 2017. this amount is net of approximately $50 million to $60 million of capitalized interest. these estimates assume that we complete the refinancing of the $1.6 billion of mortgage/mezzanine loans secured by direct and indirect interests in 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building) in new york city at market rates as well as bplp utilizing its unsecured line of credit to fund incremental development costs. although, during the upcoming year, we expect to be active in the debt markets, this activity has not been included in the above guidance and therefore our guidance could be altered by these activities. if we elect to increase our indebtedness, then our interest expense will increase. in addition, if we refinance, prepay or repurchase existing indebtedness prior to its maturity, we may incur prepayment penalties, realize the acceleration of amortized costs, and our actual interest expense may differ materially from the estimates above.
64
at december 31, 2016, our variable rate debt consisted of bplp's $1.0 billion unsecured line of credit, of which no amount was outstanding at december 31, 2016. for a summary of our consolidated debt as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015 refer to the heading "liquidity and capital resources-capitalization-debt financing" within "item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
losses from early extinguishments of debt on september 1, 2016, we used a portion of the net proceeds from bplp's august 2016 offering of senior unsecured notes (see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements) and available cash to repay the mortgage loan collateralized by our 599 lexington avenue property located in new york city totaling $750.0 million. the mortgage loan bore interest at a fixed rate of 5.57% per annum (5.41% per annum including the impact of financing costs and interest rate hedges) and was scheduled to mature on march 1, 2017. there was no prepayment penalty. we recognized a gain from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.4 million consisting of the acceleration of the remaining balance related to the effective portion of a previous interest rate hedging program included within accumulated other comprehensive loss, offset by the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.
on september 1, 2016, we used a portion of the net proceeds from bplp's august 2016 offering of senior unsecured notes (see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements) and available cash to repay the mortgage loan collateralized by our embarcadero center four property located in san francisco, california totaling approximately $344.8 million. the mortgage loan bore interest at a fixed rate of 6.10% per annum (7.02% per annum including the impact of financing costs and interest rate hedges) and was scheduled to mature on december 1, 2016. there was no prepayment penalty. we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.7 million consisting of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and the acceleration of the remaining balance related to the effective portion of a previous interest rate hedging program included within accumulated other comprehensive loss.
on december 15, 2015, we legally defeased the mortgage loan collateralized by our 100 & 200 clarendon street properties located in boston, massachusetts. the mortgage loan had an outstanding principal balance of $640.5 million, bore interest at a fixed rate of 5.68% per annum and was scheduled to mature on january 6, 2017. the cash outlay required for the defeasance in the net amount of approximately $667.3 million was based on the purchase price of u.s. government securities that will generate sufficient cash flow to fund continued interest payments on the loan from the effective date of the defeasance through, and the repayment of the loan on, october 6, 2016, which is the date on which we could repay the loan at par. in connection with the defeasance, the mortgage and other liens on the property were extinguished and all existing collateral, including various guarantees, were released. as a result of the defeasance, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $22.0 million, consisting of approximately $26.8 million, which is the difference between the purchase price for the u.s. government securities acquired for the defeasance and the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loan, and approximately $1.4 million of unamortized deferred financing costs, offset by approximately $4.8 million from the acceleration of the remaining balance of the historical fair value debt adjustment and approximately $1.4 million of accrued interest expense through the effective date of the defeasance.
losses from interest rate contracts on august 17, 2016, in conjunction with bplp's offering of senior unsecured notes, we terminated forward-starting interest rate swap contracts that fixed the 10-year swap rate at a weighted-average rate of approximately 2.423% per annum on notional amounts aggregating $550.0 million. we cash-settled the contracts and made cash payments to the counterparties aggregating approximately $49.3 million. we recognized approximately $0.1 million of losses on interest rate contracts during the year ended december 31, 2016 related to the partial ineffectiveness of the interest rate contracts. we will reclassify into earnings, as an increase to interest expense, approximately $49.2 million (or approximately $4.9 million per year over the 10-year term of the 2.750% senior unsecured notes due 2026) of the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets within accumulated other comprehensive loss, which represents the effective portion of the applicable interest rate contracts.
gains on sales of real estate the gains on sales of real estate may differ between bxp and bplp as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by bxp for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor op unit redemptions by bplp. this accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at bxp that was allocated to certain properties. the difference between the real estate assets of bxp as compared to bplp for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in the gains on sales of real estate when those properties are sold. for additional information see the explanatory note.

_______________
(1)   on september 18, 2015, we sold this property and approximately $101.1 million of the gain was allocated to the outside partners (see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements).
(2)   on september 15, 2015, we acquired our partners' nominal 50% interest (see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements).
(3)   the net loss allocation is primarily due to the partners' share of the interest expense for the outside members' notes payable which was $34.3 million and $30.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
(4)   on august 19, 2016, the consolidated entity in which we have a 55% interest and that owns this property commenced the redevelopment of the six-story, low-rise office and retail building component of the complex, which will be called 159 east 53rd street. the redeveloped portion of the low-rise building will contain approximately 195,000 net rentable square feet of class a office space and approximately 25,000 net rentable square feet of retail space. we will capitalize incremental costs during the redevelopment. bxp and bplp recognized approximately $50.8 million and $47.6 million, respectively, of depreciation expense associated with the acceleration of depreciation on the assets being removed from service and demolished as part of the redevelopment of the property. approximately $21.4 million of those amounts was allocated to the outside partners.
noncontrolling interest-common units of the operating partnership for bxp, noncontrolling interest-common units of the operating partnership decreased by approximately $7.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to a decrease in allocable income, which was the result of recognizing a greater gain on sales of real estate amount during 2015, partially offset by an increase in the noncontrolling interest's ownership percentage. due to our ownership structure, there is no corresponding line item on bplp's financial statements.

same property portfolio rental revenue rental revenue from the same property portfolio increased approximately $32.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 2014. the increase was primarily the result of increases in revenue from our leases, other recoveries and parking and other income of approximately $26.7 million, $4.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively. the increase in other recoveries was primarily in the boston region and related to tenant electric reimbursements. rental revenue from our leases increased approximately $26.7 million as a result of our average revenue per square foot increasing by approximately $1.42, contributing approximately $48.4 million partially offset by an approximately $21.7 million decrease due to a reduction in our average occupancy from 93.9% to 92.8%.
termination income termination income increased by approximately $27.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 2014.
termination income for the year ended december 31, 2015 resulted from the termination of 36 tenants across the same property portfolio which totaled approximately $38.9 million of which approximately $30.8 million, $6.4 million, $1.2 million and $0.5 million related to early terminations in our new york, san francisco, boston and washington, dc regions, respectively. the termination income from the new york region was primarily due to distributions we received from our unsecured creditor claim against lehman brothers, inc. (see below) and our negotiated early terminations of a tenant at 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building), two tenants at 601 lexington avenue and a tenant in princeton, new jersey each in order to accommodate leasing the space to other tenants. approximately $6.9 million of our termination income for the year december 31, 2015 was non-cash and resulted from the acceleration of "above-" and "below-market" lease revenue and straight-line rent adjustments.
on march 11, 2015 and september 9, 2015 we received the second and third interim distributions from our unsecured creditor claim against lehman brothers, inc. aggregating approximately $8.1 million.
termination income for the year ended december 31, 2014 resulted from the termination of 29 tenants across the same property portfolio which totaled approximately $11.2 million of which approximately $7.7 million related to an initial distribution we received from our unsecured creditor claim against lehman brothers, inc. (see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements).
real estate operating expenses real estate operating expenses from the same property portfolio increased approximately $35.7 million, or 4.6%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to (1) an increase of approximately $18.4 million, or 5.1%, in real estate taxes, which we primarily experienced in our new york cbd properties, (2) an increase of approximately $7.3 million, or 6.2%, in repairs and maintenance expense, which we primarily experienced in our boston and new york cbd buildings, (3) an increase of approximately $3.5 million, or 3.0%, in utilities expense in the boston region and new york cbd buildings, (4) an increase of approximately $3.5 million, or 8.8%, in roads and grounds expense, which we primarily experienced in the boston region and (5) an increase of approximately $3.0 million, or 2.1%, in other real estate operating expenses across the portfolio.
properties placed in-service portfolio the table below lists the properties that were placed in-service or partially placed in-service between january 1, 2014 and december 31, 2015. rental revenue and real estate operating expenses from our properties placed in-service portfolio increased approximately $80.4 million and $21.3 million, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 2014 as detailed below.

(1)   this property was sold during the first quarter of 2015. for the operating results refer to "results of operations-properties sold portfolio" within "item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.
(2)   this property was initially placed in-service during the fourth quarter of 2013 and fully placed in-service during the first quarter of 2014. for the operating results refer to "results of operations-properties placed in-service portfolio" within "item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
(3)   average monthly rental rates are calculated by us as rental revenue in accordance with gaap, divided by the weighted monthly average number of occupied units.
(4)   average physical occupancy is defined as the average number of occupied units divided by the total number of units, expressed as a percentage.
(5)   average economic occupancy is defined as total possible revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of total possible revenue. total possible revenue is determined by valuing average occupied units at contract rates and average vacant units at market rents. vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current market rents. by measuring vacant units at their market rents, average economic occupancy takes into account the fact that units of different sizes and locations within a residential property have different economic impacts on a residential property's total possible gross revenue. market rents used by us in calculating economic occupancy are based on the current market rates set by the managers of our residential properties based on their experience in renting their residential property's units and publicly available market data. trends in market rents for a region as reported by others could vary. market rents for a period are based on the average market rents during that period and do not reflect any impact for cash concessions.
hotel net operating income net operating income for the boston marriott cambridge hotel property decreased by approximately $0.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily an increase in the management fee paid to marriott partially offset by improvements in revenue per available room ("revpar") and the average daily rate.
the following reflects our occupancy and rate information for the boston marriott cambridge hotel for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014.

development and management services development and management services income decreased approximately $2.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 2014. development income decreased by approximately $3.7 million partially offset by an increase in management service income of approximately $0.9 million. the decrease in development income is primarily due to decreases in development fees earned from our boston and washington, dc third-party developments and our washington, dc joint ventures. the increase in management fees is due primarily to an increase in tenant service income from our tenants.
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased approximately $2.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to the timing of the recognition of expenses under the transition benefits agreement that we entered into with mortimer b. zuckerman in 2013. because mr. zuckerman remained employed by us through july 1, 2014, he received, on january 1, 2015, a lump sum payment of $6.7 million in cash and an equity award of ltip units with a value of approximately $11.1 million. the cash payment and equity award vested in three equal installments on each of march 10, 2013, october 1, 2013 and july 1, 2014. as a result, we recognized approximately $4.0 million of compensation expense during the year ended december 31, 2014 related to the transition benefits agreement that did not recur in 2015. we also had an approximately $1.7 million decrease in the value of bxp's deferred compensation plan and a $0.5 million decrease in other general and administrative expenses (including compensation expense). these decreases were partially offset by the following increases: (1) approximately $2.0 million related to the net effect of the end of the measurement period for the 2011 opp awards in 2014, a decrease in the quarterly expense related to the 2012 opp awards due to certain members of bxp's senior management reached retirement age and therefore became fully vested and the issuance of the 2015 myltip units and (2) an approximately $1.6 million increase in health care costs.

wages directly related to the development and leasing of rental properties are not included in our operating results. these costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets and deferred charges on our consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the applicable asset. capitalized wages for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $15.9 million and $14.5 million, respectively. these costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above.
transaction costs transaction costs decreased approximately $1.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 2014, transaction costs for both periods were primarily related to the formation of several new and pending joint ventures, pending and completed asset sales and the pursuit of other transactions, including acquisitions.
depreciation and amortization depreciation expense may differ between bxp and bplp as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by bxp for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor op unit redemptions by bplp.  this accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at bxp that was allocated to certain properties.  the difference between the real estate assets of bxp as compared to bplp for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in depreciation expense. for additional information see the explanatory note.

other income and expense items income from unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 2014, income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased by approximately $10.0 million due primarily to an approximately $11.4 million increase in our share of net income from 901 new york avenue in washington, dc. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we received a distribution of approximately
75
$24.5 million, which was generated from the excess loan proceeds from the joint venture's refinancing of its mortgage loan to a new 10-year mortgage loan totaling $225.0 million. our allocation of income and distributions for the year ended december 31, 2015 was not proportionate to our nominal ownership interest as a result of the achievement of specified investment return thresholds, as provided for in the joint venture agreement. this increase was partially offset by an approximately $1.4 million decrease in our share of net income from our other unconsolidated joint ventures that was due primarily to termination income we received from our metropolitan square property in washington, dc during the year ended december 31, 2014 that did not recur in 2015.
interest and other income interest and other income decreased approximately $2.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a tax refund we received from the district of columbia during the year ended december 31, 2014 that did not recur during 2015.
gains (losses) from investments in securities gains (losses) from investments in securities for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 related to investments that we have made to reduce our market risk relating to a deferred compensation plan that we maintain for officers of bxp. under this deferred compensation plan, each officer who is eligible to participate is permitted to defer a portion of the officer's current income on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer. in order to reduce our market risk relating to this plan, we typically acquire, in a separate account that is not restricted as to its use, similar or identical investments as those selected by each officer. this enables us to generally match our liabilities to officers of bxp under the deferred compensation plan with equivalent assets and thereby limit our market risk. the performance of these investments is recorded as gains from investments in securities. during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized gains (losses) of approximately $(0.7) million and $1.0 million, respectively, on these investments. by comparison, our general and administrative expense increased (decreased) by approximately $(0.6) million and $1.1 million during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, as a result of increases (decreases) in our liability under our deferred compensation plan that were associated with the performance of the specific investments selected by officers of bxp participating in the plan.
losses from early extinguishments of debt on december 15, 2015, we legally defeased the mortgage loan collateralized by our 100 & 200 clarendon street properties located in boston, massachusetts. the mortgage loan had an outstanding principal balance of $640.5 million, bore interest at a fixed rate of 5.68% per annum and was scheduled to mature on january 6, 2017. the cash outlay required for the defeasance in the net amount of approximately $667.3 million was based on the purchase price of u.s. government securities that will generate sufficient cash flow to fund continued interest payments on the loan from the effective date of the defeasance through, and the repayment of the loan on, october 6, 2016, which is the date on which we could repay the loan at par. in connection with the defeasance, the mortgage and other liens on the property were extinguished and all existing collateral, including various guarantees, were released. as a result of the defeasance, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $22.0 million, consisting of approximately $26.8 million, which is the difference between the purchase price for the u.s. government securities acquired for the defeasance and the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loan, and approximately $1.4 million of unamortized deferred financing costs, offset by approximately $4.8 million from the acceleration of the remaining balance of the historical fair value debt adjustment and approximately $1.4 million of accrued interest expense through the effective date of the defeasance.
on december 15, 2014, we used available cash to redeem $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of bplp's 5.625% senior notes due 2015 (the "5.625% notes") and $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.000% senior notes due 2015 (the "5.000% notes"). the redemption price for the 5.625% notes was determined in accordance with the applicable indenture and totaled approximately $308.0 million. the redemption price included approximately $2.8 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. excluding such accrued and unpaid interest, the redemption price was approximately 101.73% of the principal amount being redeemed. the redemption price for the 5.000% notes was determined in accordance with the applicable indenture and totaled approximately $255.8 million. the redemption price included approximately $0.5 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. excluding such accrued and unpaid interest, the redemption price was approximately 102.13% of the principal amount being redeemed. we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $10.6 million, which amount included the payment of the redemption premium totaling approximately $10.5 million.

(1)   the decrease was primarily due to the completion of several development projects. for a list of developments placed in-service refer to "results of operations-properties placed in-service portfolio" within "item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
(2)   all of bplp's exchangeable senior notes were repaid as of february 18, 2014.
(3)   represents the repayment of new dominion technology park building two mortgage loan on july 1, 2014 and kingstowne two and retail mortgage loan on october 1, 2015.
interest expense directly related to the development of rental properties is not included in our operating results. these costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate. as properties are placed in-service, we cease capitalizing interest and interest is then expensed. interest capitalized for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $34.2 million and $52.5 million, respectively. these costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above.
at december 31, 2015, our variable rate debt consisted of bplp's $1.0 billion unsecured line of credit, of which no amount was outstanding at december 31, 2015. for a summary of our consolidated debt as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 refer to the heading "liquidity and capital resources-capitalization-debt financing" within "item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
gains on sales of real estate the gains on sales of real estate may differ between bxp and bplp as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by bxp for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor op unit redemptions by bplp. this accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at bxp that was allocated to certain properties. the difference between the real estate assets of bxp as compared to bplp for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in the gains on sales of real estate when those properties are sold. for additional information see the explanatory note.

(1)   this property has 335 apartment units and approximately 50,000 net rentable square feet of retail space. we have agreed to provide net operating income support of up to $6.0 million should the property's net operating income fail to achieve certain thresholds, which has been recorded as a reduction to the gain on sale. this property is subject to a ground lease that expires on february 1, 2068.
(2)   this property was owned by a consolidated entity in which we had a 50% interest. the buyer assumed the mortgage loan which had a balance of $117.0 million. approximately $101.1 million of the gain on sale of real estate was allocated to the outside partners and is included within noncontrolling interests in property partnerships in our consolidated statements of operations.
(3)   this is a 26-acre site with one occupied and three vacant existing office buildings. the remainder of the site is currently used for 1,699 surface parking spaces, but the land supports an additional 537,000 square feet of office/r&amp;d development and two parking structures with a total of approximately 3,000 parking spaces.
(4)   excludes approximately $0.4 million of gain on sale of real estate recognized during the three months ended december 31, 2015 related to previously deferred gain amounts from a 2014 sale of real estate.
(5)   mountain view technology park is a seven-building complex.
(6)   land was taken by eminent domain.
(7)   land parcel was subject to a ground lease that was scheduled to expire on october 31, 2048 with a tenant that exercised its purchase option under the ground lease.
(8)   this property is a three-building complex. we have agreed to provide rent support payments to the buyer with a maximum obligation of up to approximately $12.3 million related to the leasing of 17,762 net rentable square feet at the properties, which has been recorded as a reduction to the gain on sale.
(9)   we completed the conveyance to an unrelated third party of a condominium interest in our 75 ames street property located in cambridge, massachusetts. on may 23, 2011, we had entered into a ground lease for the vacant land parcel at 75 ames street and had also entered into a development agreement to serve as project manager for a 250,000 square foot research laboratory building to be developed on the site at the ground lessee's expense and to also serve, upon completion of development, as property manager. gross proceeds to us were approximately $56.8 million, including $11.4 million in development fees for our services, and were received beginning in may 2011. the cash received under the ground lease was initially recognized as unearned revenue and recognized over the 99-year term of the ground lease as ground lease revenue totaling approximately $459,000 per year prior to the
78
conveyance of the condominium interest. the terms of the ground lease required us to form a condominium for the site upon completion of the development, at which time each party would subject their respective interests in the buildings and land to the condominium and would in turn be conveyed a condominium unit comprised of their respective building as well as an undivided ownership interest in the land. as a result of the conveyance and the transfer of title, we recognized a gain on sale of real estate.

(1)   this property has 335 apartment units and approximately 50,000 net rentable square feet of retail space. we have agreed to provide net operating income support of up to $6.0 million should the property's net operating income fail to achieve certain thresholds, which has been recorded as a reduction to the gain on sale. this property is subject to a ground lease that expires on february 1, 2068.
(2)   this property was owned by a consolidated entity in which we had a 50% interest. the buyer assumed the mortgage loan which had a balance of $117.0 million. approximately $101.1 million of the gain on sale of real estate was allocated to the outside partners and is included within noncontrolling interests in property partnerships in our consolidated statements of operations.
(3)   this is a 26-acre site with one occupied and three vacant existing office buildings. the remainder of the site is currently used for 1,699 surface parking spaces, but the land supports an additional 537,000 square feet of office/r&amp;d development and two parking structures with a total of approximately 3,000 parking spaces.
(4)   excludes approximately $0.4 million of gain on sale of real estate recognized during the three months ended december 31, 2015 related to previously deferred gain amounts from a 2014 sale of real estate.
(5)   mountain view technology park is a seven-building complex.
(6)   land was taken by eminent domain.
(7)   land parcel was subject to a ground lease that was scheduled to expire on october 31, 2048 with a tenant that exercised its purchase option under the ground lease.
(8)   this property is a three-building complex. we have agreed to provide rent support payments to the buyer with a maximum obligation of up to approximately $12.3 million related to the leasing of 17,762 net rentable square feet at the properties, which has been recorded as a reduction to the gain on sale.

(9)   we completed the conveyance to an unrelated third party of a condominium interest in our 75 ames street property located in cambridge, massachusetts. on may 23, 2011, we had entered into a ground lease for the vacant land parcel at 75 ames street and had also entered into a development agreement to serve as project manager for a 250,000 square foot research laboratory building to be developed on the site at the ground lessee's expense and to also serve, upon completion of development, as property manager. gross proceeds to us were approximately $56.8 million, including $11.4 million in development fees for our services, and were received beginning in may 2011. the cash received under the ground lease was initially recognized as unearned revenue and recognized over the 99-year term of the ground lease as ground lease revenue totaling approximately $459,000 per year prior to the conveyance of the condominium interest. the terms of the ground lease required us to form a condominium for the site upon completion of the development, at which time each party would subject their respective interests in the buildings and land to the condominium and would in turn be conveyed a condominium unit comprised of their respective building as well as an undivided ownership interest in the land. as a result of the conveyance and the transfer of title, we recognized a gain on sale of real estate.

_______________
(1)   on september 18, 2015, we recognized a gain on sale of real estate totaling approximately $199.5 million and $199.7 million for bxp and bplp, respectively, of which approximately $101.1 million was allocated to the outside partners (see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements).
(2)   on august 6, 2015, the parties amended the joint venture agreement which required us to acquire our partner's nominal 50% interest on september 15, 2015 for approximately $100.9 million in cash. as a result, we stopped accreting the changes in the redemption value through the consolidated statement of operations as of august 6, 2015 (see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements). upon our acquisition, we owned 100% and therefore we no longer have noncontrolling interest on this property. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we made an out-of-period adjustment of approximately $1.9 million related to the cumulative non-cash adjustment to the accretion of the changes in the redemption value of the noncontrolling interest.
(3)   the net loss allocation is primarily due to the partners' share of the interest expense for the outside members' notes payable which was $30.8 million and $28.3 million for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
noncontrolling interest-common units of the operating partnership for bxp, noncontrolling interest-common units of the operating partnership increased by approximately $16.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 2014 due to increases in allocable income and the noncontrolling interest's ownership percentage. due to our ownership structure, there is no corresponding line item on bplp's financial statements.

liquidity and capital resources general our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to:
•   fund normal recurring expenses;
•   meet debt service and principal repayment obligations, including balloon payments on maturing debt;
•   fund capital expenditures, including major renovations, tenant improvements and leasing costs;
•   fund development costs;
•   fund dividend requirements on our series b preferred stock
•   fund possible property acquisitions; and
•   make the minimum distributions required to enable bxp to maintain its reit qualification under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended.
we expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following:
•   cash flow from operations;
•   distribution of cash flows from joint ventures;
•   cash and cash equivalent balances;
•   issuances of bxp equity securities and/or additional preferred or common units of partnership interest in bplp;
•   bplp's unsecured line of credit or other short-term bridge facilities;
•   construction loans;
•   long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness (including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness); and
•   sales of real estate.
we draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long-term capital needs. our current consolidated development properties are expected to be funded with available cash balances, bplp's unsecured line of credit, unsecured bridge loans and construction loans. we use bplp's unsecured line of credit primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, refinance outstanding indebtedness and meet short-term development and working capital needs. although we may seek to fund our development projects with construction loans, which may be guaranteed by bplp, the financing for each particular project ultimately depends on several factors, including, among others, the project's size and duration, whether the property is held in joint venture structure, the extent of pre-leasing and our available cash and access to cost effective capital at the given time.

(3)   this property was 39% placed in-service.
(4)   this property was 28% placed in-service.
(5)   under the joint venture agreement, if the project is funded with 100% equity, we have agreed to fund 50% of our partner's equity requirement, structured as preferred equity. we will fund approximately $25.4 million at a rate of libor plus 3.0% per annum and receive priority distributions from all distributions to our partner until the principal and interest are repaid. as of december 31, 2016, we have funded approximately $4.3 million.
(6)   this development has a $125 million construction facility. as of december 31, 2016, no amounts have been drawn under this facility.
(7)   includes approximately 9,000 square feet of retail space at the proto at cambridge residential development, which is 0% leased.

contractual rental revenue, recoveries from tenants, other income from operations, available cash balances and draws on bplp's unsecured line of credit are the principal sources of capital that we use to pay operating expenses, debt service, maintenance capital expenditures, tenant improvements and the minimum distribution required to enable bxp to maintain its reit qualification. we seek to maximize income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. our sources of revenue also include third-party fees generated by our property management, leasing and development and construction businesses, as well as the sale of assets from time to time. we believe our revenue, together with our cash balances and proceeds from financing activities, will continue to provide the funds necessary for our short-term liquidity needs, including our properties under development and redevelopment.
82
material adverse changes in one or more sources of capital may adversely affect our net cash flows. such changes, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to fund operating expenses, dividends and distributions, debt service payments, maintenance and repositioning capital expenditures and tenant improvements. in addition, a material adverse change in the cash provided by our operations may affect our ability to comply with the financial covenants under bplp's unsecured line of credit and unsecured senior notes.
our primary uses of capital will be the completion of our current development and redevelopment projects. as of december 31, 2016, our share of the remaining development and redevelopment costs that we expect to fund through 2020 is approximately $1.0 billion. with approximately $289.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $869 million available under bplp's unsecured line of credit, as of february 22, 2017, we believe we have sufficient capital to complete these projects. we believe that our strong liquidity, including our availability under bplp's unsecured line of credit, and proceeds from debt financings and asset sales provide sufficient liquidity to fund our remaining capital requirements on existing development and redevelopment projects and pursue additional attractive investment opportunities. we also have full availability under bxp's $600 million at-the-market equity offering program ("atm program"). the atm program expires june 3, 2017 and we expect to establish a subsequent atm program.
our consolidated debt maturities through the end of 2017 consist of indebtedness secured by direct and indirect interests in 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building) in new york city totaling approximately $1.8 billion.  of this amount, approximately $0.2 billion represents outside members' notes payable, which are allocated to our partners through noncontrolling interest.  because the amount of each member loan as a percentage of the total amount of member loans is equal to each member's percentage ownership interest in the consolidated joint venture entity that owns 767 fifth avenue, we do not expect the joint venture to require newly raised cash to repay the loans.  based on our 60% ownership of the consolidated entity that owns 767 fifth avenue, our share of the remaining $1.6 billion of maturing debt is approximately $960 million.  these loans have a weighted-average coupon/stated interest rate of approximately 5.96% per annum, a gaap interest rate of approximately 3.01% per annum and mature in october 2017, and they may be prepaid without penalty beginning in june 2017.
to reduce the risk associated with potential future interest rate increases prior to refinancing this debt, 767 fifth partners llc, which is a subsidiary of the consolidated entity in which we have a 60% interest and that owns 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building) in new york city, entered into forward-starting interest rate swap contracts that fix the 10-year swap rate at a weighted-average rate of approximately 2.619% per annum on notional amounts aggregating $450 million. these swaps are targeting the refinancing of the property's mortgage/mezzanine loans on june 1, 2017, and we currently expect to refinance these loans with a new secured financing (see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).
given the relatively low interest rates currently available to us in the debt markets, we may seek to enhance our liquidity to provide sufficient capacity to meet our debt obligations and to fund our remaining capital requirements on existing development projects, our foreseeable potential development activity and pursue attractive additional investment opportunities. depending on interest rates and overall conditions in the public debt markets, we may determine to access the public debt markets in advance of the need for the funds and this may result in us carrying additional cash and cash equivalents pending bplp's use of the proceeds, and doing so would be dilutive to our earnings because it would increase our net interest expense.
reit tax distribution considerations dividend bxp as a reit is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that bxp currently distribute at least 90% of its annual taxable income (excluding capital gains and with certain other adjustments). our policy is for bxp to distribute at least 100% of its taxable income, including capital gains, to avoid paying federal tax. on december 19, 2016, the board of directors of bxp increased our regular quarterly dividend to $0.75 per common share. common and ltip unitholders of limited partnership interest in bplp, as of the close of business on december 30, 2016, received the same total distribution per unit, on january 30, 2017.
bxp's board of directors will continue to evaluate bxp's dividend rate in light of our actual and projected taxable income, liquidity requirements and other circumstances, and there can be no assurance that the future dividends declared by its board of directors will not differ materially.
application of recent regulations in september 2013, the internal revenue service released final regulations governing when taxpayers like us must capitalize and depreciate costs for acquiring, maintaining, repairing and replacing tangible property and when they can deduct such costs.  these final regulations are effective for tax years beginning on or after january 1, 2014. these regulations
83
permitted us to deduct certain types of expenditures that were previously required to be capitalized by us. they also allowed us to make a one-time election to immediately deduct certain amounts that were capitalized in previous years that are not required to be capitalized under the new regulations.  we analyzed how the application of the new regulations affects our business and decided to make the election for the 2014 tax year. although such an election had an immaterial impact on our gaap financial statements and funds from operations, it materially reduced our taxable income and therefore bxp's dividend payout requirements under applicable reit tax regulations for 2014. it also could have an impact on bxp's dividend payout requirements in future years, as the amounts deducted in 2014 will no longer be depreciated over time, and amounts expended and deducted in future periods will vary, potentially resulting in more variation in our distribution requirement from year to year depending on our annual cost of now-deductible expenditures that previously would have been capitalized.  although bxp made the election for tax year 2014, there can be no assurance concerning the impact, if any, on the dividends declared by the board of directors of bxp in future taxable years.
sales to the extent that we sell assets at a gain and cannot efficiently use the proceeds in a tax deferred manner for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, bxp would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce our indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities. such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then-current and anticipated leverage, the cost and availability of capital from other sources, the price of bxp's common stock and reit distribution requirements. at a minimum, we expect that bxp would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for bxp to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales.
cash flow summary the following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below.
cash and cash equivalents were approximately $0.4 billion and $0.7 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing a decrease of approximately $0.3 billion. the following table sets forth changes in cash flows:

our principal source of cash flow is related to the operation of our properties. the average term of our in-place tenant leases, including our unconsolidated joint ventures, is approximately 7.3 years with occupancy rates historically in the range of 90% to 94%. our properties generate a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service and fund regular quarterly dividend and distribution payment requirements. in addition, over the past several years, we have raised capital through the sale of some of our properties, secured and unsecured borrowings and equity offerings of bxp.
cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development, net investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and maintenance and repositioning capital expenditures. we selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing and property management skills and invest in existing buildings to enhance or maintain their market position. cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2016 consisted primarily of development projects, tenant improvements and capital contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of real estate. cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2015 consisted primarily of the defeasance of a mortgage loan, funding of our development projects and capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures partially offset by the proceeds from the sales of real estate as detailed below:

(3)   on august 16, 2016, we completed the sale of a parcel of land within our broad run business park property located in loudoun county, virginia. net cash proceeds totaled approximately $17.9 million. the sale of the land parcel was completed as part of a like-kind exchange under section 1031 of the internal revenue code.
on february 1, 2016, we completed the sale of our 415 main street property located in cambridge, massachusetts to the tenant for a gross sale price of approximately $105.4 million.  net cash proceeds totaled approximately $104.9 million. as of december 31, 2016, we had released from escrow approximately $104.7 million of the proceeds that were being held for possible investment in a like-kind exchange in accordance with section 1031 of the internal revenue code.
on december 17, 2015, we completed the sale of our innovation place property for a gross sale price of $207.0 million. net cash proceeds totaled approximately $199.3 million.
on october 1, 2015, we completed the sale of an additional parcel of land within our washingtonian north property located in gaithersburg, maryland for a gross sale price of approximately $13.3 million. net cash proceeds, which included reimbursements for certain infrastructure costs, totaled approximately $13.8 million.
on september 18, 2015, a consolidated entity in which we have a 50% interest completed the sale of its 505 9th street, n.w. property located in washington, dc for approximately $318.0 million, including the assumption by the buyer of
85
approximately $117.0 million of mortgage indebtedness.  net cash proceeds totaled approximately $194.6 million, of which our share was approximately $97.3 million.

(4)   cash released from escrow for investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2016 was related to the release of an escrow account related to the repayment of the secured debt collateralized by our fountain square property located in reston, virginia (see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements).
(5)   capital contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended december 31, 2016 were primarily due to cash contributions of approximately $507.1 million to fund our acquisition of a 49.8% interest in colorado center on july 1, 2016 (see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). in addition, we had capital contributions of approximately $33.1 million, $22.2 million and $13.1 million to our hub on causeway, dock 72 and 1265 main street joint ventures, respectively, which were primarily used to fund development activities.
capital contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended december 31, 2015 were primarily due to cash contributions of approximately $14.3 million, $11.9 million and $11.5 million to our hub on causeway, 1265 main street and dock 72 at the brooklyn navy yard joint ventures, respectively, which were primarily used to fund development activities.
(6)   capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended december 31, 2016 were primarily due to a return of capital made by the joint venture that owns 1265 main street located in waltham, ma. on december 8, 2016, the joint venture obtained mortgage financing totaling $40.4 million collateralized by the property and subsequently distributed the proceeds of the mortgage financing.
capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended december 31, 2015 were primarily due to a distribution made by the joint venture that owns 901 new york avenue located in washington, dc. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we received a distribution of approximately $24.5 million, which was generated from the excess loan proceeds from the joint venture's refinancing of its mortgage loan to a new 10-year mortgage loan totaling $225.0 million. our allocation of income and distributions for the year ended december 31, 2015 was not proportionate to our nominal ownership interest as a result of the achievement of specified investment return thresholds, as provided for in the joint venture agreement.
(7)   on october 20, 2016, we and our partner in the unconsolidated joint venture that owns metropolitan square located in washington, dc, completed the sale of an 80% interest in the joint venture for a gross sale price of approximately $282.4 million, including the assumption by the buyer of its pro rata share of the mortgage loan collateralized by the property totaling approximately $133.4 million. in addition, the buyer agreed to assume certain unfunded leasing costs totaling approximately $14.2 million. net proceeds to us totaled approximately $58.2 million, resulting in a gain on sale of investment totaling approximately $59.4 million. prior to the sale, we owned a 51% interest and our partner owned a 49% interest in the joint venture. following the sale, we continue to own a 20% interest in the joint venture with the buyer owning the remaining 80%. metropolitan square is an approximately 607,000 net rentable square foot class a office property.
(8)   on december 15, 2015, we legally defeased the mortgage loan collateralized by our 100 &amp; 200 clarendon street properties located in boston, massachusetts. the mortgage loan had an outstanding principal balance of $640.5 million, bore interest at a fixed rate of 5.68% per annum and was scheduled to mature on january 6, 2017. the cash outlay required for the defeasance in the net amount of approximately $667.3 million was based on the purchase price of u.s. government securities that will generate sufficient cash flow to fund continued interest payments on the loan from the effective date of the defeasance through, and the repayment of the loan on, october 6, 2016, which is the date on which we could repay the loan at par.
86
cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2016 totaled approximately $0.1 billion. this consisted primarily of the approximately $1.3 billion repayment of the secured debt collateralized by our fountain square, embarcadero center four and 599 lexington avenue properties and the approximately $671.6 million payment of our regular and special dividends and distributions to our shareholders and unitholders, partially offset by the issuances by bplp of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of its 3.650% senior unsecured notes due 2026 and $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of its 2.750% senior unsecured notes due 2026. future debt payments are discussed below under the heading "capitalization-debt financing."

consolidated debt to consolidated market capitalization ratio is a measure of leverage commonly used by analysts in the reit industry. we present this measure as a percentage and it is calculated by dividing (a) our consolidated debt by (b) our consolidated market capitalization, which is the market value of our outstanding equity securities plus our consolidated debt. consolidated market capitalization is the sum of:
(1) our consolidated debt; plus
(2) the product of (x) the closing price per share of bxp common stock on december 31, 2016, as reported by the new york stock exchange, multiplied by (y) the sum of:
(i)   the number of outstanding shares of common stock of bxp,
(ii)   the number of outstanding op units in bplp (excluding op units held by bxp),
(iii)   the number of op units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding ltip units, assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the ltip units,
(iv)   the number of op units issuable upon conversion of 2012 opp units that were issued in the form of ltip units, and
(v)   the number of op units issuable upon conversion of 2013 myltip units that were issued in the form of ltip units; plus
(3) the aggregate liquidation preference ($2,500 per share) of the outstanding shares of bxp's 5.25% series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock.
the calculation of consolidated market capitalization does not include ltip units issued in the form of myltip awards unless and until certain performance thresholds are achieved and they are earned. because their three-year performance periods have not yet ended, 2014, 2015 and 2016 myltip units (see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements) are not included in this calculation as of december 31, 2016.
we also present bxp's share of combined market capitalization, which is calculated in the same manner, except that bxp's share of combined debt is utilized instead of our consolidated debt in both the numerator and the denominator. bxp's share of combined debt is defined as our combined debt, minus our partners' share of debt from our consolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon the partners' percentage ownership interests). combined debt is defined as the sum of (x) our consolidated debt, plus (y) our share of debt from our unconsolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon our percentage ownership interest). management believes that combined debt provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition because it includes our share of debt from unconsolidated joint ventures and, for bxp's share of combined debt, excludes our partners' share of debt from consolidated joint ventures, in each case presented on the same basis. we have several significant joint ventures and presenting various measures of financial condition in this manner can help investors better understand our financial condition and/or results of operations after taking into account our economic interest in these joint ventures.  we caution investors that the ownership percentages used in calculating combined debt and bxp's share of combined debt may not completely and accurately depict all of the legal and economic implications of holding an interest in a consolidated or unconsolidated joint venture. for example, in addition to partners' interests in profits and capital, partnership agreements vary in the allocation of rights regarding decision making (both for routine and major decisions), distributions, transferability of interests, liquidations, etc. as a result, presentations of measures on a combined basis and showing bxp's share of a combined amount should be considered with and as a supplement to our financial information presented in accordance with gaap.
we present these supplemental ratios because our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes and because different investors and lenders consider one or both of these ratios. investors should understand that these ratios are, in part, a function of the market price of the common stock of bxp and as such will fluctuate with changes in such price, and they do not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations. however, for a company like bxp, whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, these ratios may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as they are evaluated along with the ratio of indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts and other financial ratios, as well as the various components of our outstanding indebtedness.

debt financing as of december 31, 2016, we had approximately $9.8 billion of outstanding consolidated indebtedness, representing approximately 31.00% of our consolidated market capitalization as calculated above consisting of approximately (1) $7.246 billion (net of discount) in publicly traded unsecured senior notes having a gaap weighted-average interest rate of 4.21% per annum and maturities in 2018 through 2026; (2) $2.1 billion of property-specific mortgage debt having a gaap weighted-average interest rate of 3.33% per annum and weighted-average term of 2.3 years, (3) $0.3 billion of mezzanine notes payable associated with 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building), having a gaap interest rate of 5.53% per annum and maturing on october 7, 2017 and (4) $0.2 billion of outside members' notes payable, that matures on june 9, 2017, which are allocated to our partners' through noncontrolling interest, associated with 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building) in new york city.

month period plus 1.00%, in each case, plus a margin ranging from 0.0% to 0.70% based on bplp's credit rating. the unsecured line of credit also contains a competitive bid option that allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to make loan advances to bplp at a reduced interest rate. in addition, bplp is also obligated to pay (1) in quarterly installments a facility fee on the total commitment at a rate per annum ranging from 0.125% to 0.35% based on bplp's credit rating and (2) an annual fee on the undrawn amount of each letter of credit equal to the libor margin. based on bplp's current credit ratings, the libor and cdor margin is 1.00%, the alternate base rate margin is 0.0% and the facility fee is 0.15%.
the terms of the unsecured line of credit require that bplp maintain a number of customary financial and other covenants on an ongoing basis, including: (1) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however, the leverage ratio may increase to no greater than 65% provided that it is reduced back to 60% within one year, (2) a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 55%, (3) a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.40, (4) an unsecured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however, the unsecured debt leverage ratio may increase to no greater than 65% provided that it is reduced back to 60% within one year, (5) an unsecured debt interest coverage ratio of at least 1.75 and (6) limitations on permitted investments. bplp believes it is in compliance with the financial and other covenants listed above.
as of december 31, 2016, bplp had no amounts outstanding and letters of credit totaling approximately $6.0 million outstanding under the unsecured line of credit, and the ability to borrow approximately $994.0 million. as of february 22, 2017, bplp had approximately $125 million outstanding and letters of credit totaling approximately $6.0 million outstanding under the unsecured line of credit, and the ability to borrow approximately $869.0 million.
unsecured senior notes, net on january 20, 2016, bplp completed a public offering of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of its 3.650% senior unsecured notes due 2026. the notes were priced at 99.708% of the principal amount to yield an effective rate (including financing fees) of approximately 3.766% per annum to maturity. the notes will mature on february 1, 2026, unless earlier redeemed. the aggregate net proceeds from the offering were approximately $988.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and transaction expenses.
on august 17, 2016, bplp completed a public offering of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of its 2.750% senior unsecured notes due 2026. the notes were priced at 99.271% of the principal amount to yield an effective rate, including financing fees and the impact of the settlement of certain forward-starting interest rate swap contracts (see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements), of approximately 3.495% per annum to maturity. the notes will mature on october 1, 2026, unless earlier redeemed. the aggregate net proceeds from the offering were approximately $984.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and transaction expenses.
the indenture under which our unsecured senior notes were issued contains restrictions on incurring debt and using our assets as security in other financing transactions and other customary financial and other covenants, including (1) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, (2) a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 50%, (3) an interest coverage ratio of greater than 1.50, and (4) unencumbered asset value to be no less than 150% of our unsecured debt. as of december 31, 2016, bplp believes it was in compliance with each of these financial restrictions and requirements.
for a description of bplp's outstanding unsecured senior notes as of december 31, 2016, see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
derivative instruments and hedging activities on february 19, 2015, bplp commenced a planned interest rate hedging program. during the year ended december 31, 2015, bplp entered into seventeen forward-starting interest rate swap contracts that fix the 10-year swap rate at a weighted-average rate of approximately 2.423% per annum on notional amounts aggregating $550.0 million. these interest rate swap contracts were entered into in advance of a financing with a target commencement date in september 2016 and maturity in september 2026. on august 17, 2016, in conjunction with bplp's offering of its 2.750% unsecured senior notes due 2026 (see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements), we terminated the forward-starting interest rate swap contracts and cash-settled the contracts by making cash payments to the counterparties aggregating approximately $49.3 million. we recognized approximately $0.1 million of losses on interest rate contracts during the year ended december 31, 2016 related to the partial ineffectiveness of the interest rate contracts. we will reclassify into earnings, as an increase to interest expense, approximately $49.2 million (or approximately $4.9 million per year over the 10-year term of the 2.750% senior unsecured notes due 2026) of the amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets within accumulated other comprehensive loss, which represents the effective portion of the applicable interest rate contracts.

in addition, beginning in 2015, our 767 fifth partners llc, which is a subsidiary of the consolidated entity in which we have a 60% interest and that owns 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building) in new york city, entered into sixteen forward-starting interest rate swap contracts that fix the 10-year swap rate at a weighted-average rate of approximately 2.619% per annum on notional amounts aggregating $450.0 million. these interest rate swap contracts were entered into in advance of a financing with a target commencement date in june 2017 and maturity in june 2027. our 767 fifth partners llc consolidated entity entered into the interest rate swap contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges to reduce its exposure to the variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in the 10-year swap rate in contemplation of obtaining 10-year fixed-rate financing in june 2017 (see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).

outside members' notes payable in conjunction with the consolidation of 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building), we recorded loans payable to the joint venture's partners totaling $450.0 million. the member loans bear interest at a fixed rate of 11.0% per annum and mature on june 9, 2017. we have eliminated in consolidation our member loan totaling $270.0 million and our share of the related accrued interest payable of approximately $230.6 million at december 31, 2016. the remaining notes payable to the outside joint venture partners and related accrued interest payable totaling $180.0 million and approximately $153.8 million as of december 31, 2016 have been reflected as outside members' notes payable and within accrued interest payable, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. the related interest expense from the outside members' notes payable totaling approximately $34.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 is fully allocated to the outside joint venture partners as an adjustment to noncontrolling interests in property partnerships in our consolidated statements of operations.
market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. our primary market risk results from our indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable rates. the fair value of our debt obligations are affected by changes in the market interest rates. we manage our market risk by matching long-term leases with long-term, fixed-rate, non-recourse debt of similar duration. we continue to follow a conservative strategy of generally pre-leasing development projects on a long-term basis to creditworthy tenants in order to achieve the most favorable construction and permanent financing terms. all of our outstanding debt, excluding our unconsolidated joint ventures, has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the interest rate risk through the maturity of such outstanding debt. we also manage our market risk by entering into hedging arrangements with financial institutions. our primary objectives when undertaking hedging transactions and derivative positions is to reduce our floating rate exposure and to fix a portion of the interest rate for anticipated financing and refinancing transactions. this in turn, reduces the risks that the variability of cash flows imposes on variable rate debt. our strategy mitigates against future increases in our interest rates.
at december 31, 2016, our weighted-average coupon/stated rate on all of our outstanding consolidated debt, all of which had a fixed interest rate, was 4.50% per annum. at december 31, 2016, we had no outstanding consolidated variable rate debt. the fixed interest rate excludes the outside members' notes payable because they are allocated to the partners.
funds from operations pursuant to the revised definition of funds from operations adopted by the board of governors of nareit, we calculate funds from operations, or "ffo," for each of bxp and bplp by adjusting net income (loss) attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income (loss) attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders, respectively, (computed in accordance with gaap) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, impairment losses on depreciable real estate consolidated on our balance sheet, impairment losses on our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures, real estate-related depreciation and amortization, and our share of income (loss) from unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. ffo is a non-gaap financial measure, but we believe the presentation of ffo, combined with the presentation of required gaap financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful. management generally considers ffo to be
93
useful measures for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), ffo can help investors compare the operating performance of a company's real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies.
our computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently. we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership as presented in our consolidated financial statements. ffo should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders or net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders (determined in accordance with gaap) or any other gaap financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with gaap.

net operating income ("noi") is a non-gaap financial measure equal to net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders, the most directly comparable gaap financial measures, plus (1) preferred dividends/distributions, noncontrolling interests, impairment loss, losses from interest rate contracts, losses (gains) from early extinguishments of debt, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, transaction costs and general and administrative expense less (2) discontinued operations, gains on sales of real estate, gains (losses) from investments in securities, interest and other income, gains on consolidation of joint ventures, gain on sale of investment in unconsolidated joint venture, income from unconsolidated joint ventures and development and management services income. we use noi internally as a performance measure and believe it provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because, when compared across periods, it reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders. for example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. similarly, interest expense may be incurred at the property level even though the financing proceeds may be used at the corporate level (e.g., for other investment activity). in addition, because of historical
101
cost accounting and useful life estimates, depreciation and amortization may distort operating performance measures at the property level.
noi presented by us may not be comparable to noi reported by other reits or real estate companies that define noi differently. we believe that, in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, noi should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders as presented in our consolidated financial statements. noi should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders or net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders (determined in accordance with gaap) or any other gaap financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with gaap.

_______________
(1)   amounts include principal and interest payments.
(2)   committed tenant-related obligations based on executed leases as of december 31, 2016 (tenant improvements and lease commissions).
(3)   includes 100% of the obligations for our consolidated entities and only our share for the unconsolidated joint ventures.
(4)   includes capital lease obligations that we have at two properties.
we have various standing or renewable service contracts with vendors related to our property management. in addition, we have certain other contracts we enter into in the ordinary course of business that may extend beyond one year. these contracts are not included as part of our contractual obligations because they include terms that provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties. contract terms are generally between three to five years.
during 2016, we paid approximately $326.4 million to fund tenant-related obligations, including tenant improvements and leasing commissions, and incurred approximately $438 million of new tenant-related obligations associated with approximately 5.6 million square feet of second generation leases, or approximately $78 per square foot. in addition, we signed leases for approximately 748,000 square feet at our development properties. the tenant-related obligations for the development properties are included within the projects' "estimated total investment" referred to in "item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-liquidity and capital resources." in the aggregate, during 2016, we signed leases for approximately 6.4 million square feet of space and incurred aggregate tenant-related obligations of approximately $512 million, or approximately $80 per square foot.
off-balance sheet arrangements-joint venture indebtedness we have investments in unconsolidated joint ventures with our effective ownership interests ranging from 20% to 60%. eight of these joint ventures have mortgage indebtedness. we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities and therefore they are presently accounted for using the equity method of accounting. see also note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. at december 31, 2016, the aggregate carrying amount of debt, including both our and our
102
partners' share, incurred by these ventures was approximately $865.7 million (of which our proportionate share is approximately $318.2 million). the table below summarizes the outstanding debt of these joint venture properties at december 31, 2016. from time to time, we (or the applicable joint venture) have also agreed to guarantee portions of the principal, interest or other amounts in connection with other unconsolidated joint venture borrowings. in addition, we have agreed to customary construction completion guarantees for construction loans, environmental indemnifications and nonrecourse carve-outs (e.g., guarantees against fraud, misrepresentation and bankruptcy) on certain of the loans.

(1)   gaap interest rate differs from the stated interest rate due to the inclusion of the amortization of financing charges.
(2)   the loan requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity.
(3)   mortgage loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to libor plus 1.50% per annum.
(4)   on april 11, 2016, a joint venture in which we have a 50% interest received an event of default notice from the lender. subsequently, the cash flows generated from the property have become insufficient to fund debt service payments and capital improvements necessary to lease and operate the property and the joint venture is not prepared to fund additional cash shortfalls at this time. consequently, the joint venture is not current on making debt service payments and remains in default. the lender notified the joint venture that it has elected to charge the default interest rate on the loan equal to libor plus 5.75% per annum. the joint venture is currently in discussions with the lender regarding the event of default, although there can be no assurance as to the outcome of those discussions. (see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).
(5)   the loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to libor plus 2.25% per annum.
(6)   the loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to libor plus 2.35% per annum and matures on december 7, 2019, with three, one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions.
(7)   no amounts have been drawn under the $250.0 million construction facility. the construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to libor plus 2.25% per annum and matures on december 18, 2020 with two, one-year extension option, subject to certain conditions.
environmental matters it is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update phase i environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys in connection with our acquisition of properties. these pre-purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and we are not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to our properties that we believe would have such a material adverse effect. however, from time to time environmental conditions at our properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing and/or regulatory filings, as well as remedial action.
in february 1999, we (through a joint venture) acquired from exxon corporation a property in massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain

soil and groundwater contamination. we developed an office park on the property. we engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction. under the property acquisition agreement, exxon agreed to (1) bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to our ownership, (2) continue monitoring and/or remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3) indemnify us for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions. any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses, and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges.
environmental investigations at some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source properties. in each case we engaged a licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments, and to prepare any required submittals to the regulatory authorities. in each case the environmental consultant concluded that the properties qualify under the regulatory program or the regulatory practice for a status which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site. we also believe that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory provisions or regulatory practices regarding upgradient releases. although we believe that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may bear responsibility for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, we will take such further response actions (if any) that we deem necessary or advisable. other than periodic testing at some of these properties, no such additional response actions are anticipated at this time.
some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical use of the areas have caused site contamination. accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures and/or include particular building design features in connection with development, construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and/or ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner. in these situations, it is our practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination, including potential issues associated with contaminant migration, assess potential liability risks and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures. we then use this information as part of our decision-making process with respect to the acquisition, deal structure and/or development of the property. for example, we own a parcel in massachusetts which was formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility. pre-purchase testing indicated that the site contained relatively low levels of certain contaminants. we have developed an office park on this property. prior to and during redevelopment activities, we engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory submittals based on the results of an environmental risk characterization. a submittal has been made to the regulatory authorities in order to achieve regulatory closure at this site. the submittal included an environmental deed restriction that mandates compliance with certain protective measures in a portion of the site where low levels of residual soil contamination have been left in place in accordance with applicable laws.
we expect that resolution of the environmental matters described above will not have a material impact on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. however, we cannot assure you that we have identified all environmental liabilities at our properties, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties, that we will be indemnified, in full or at all, or that we will have insurance coverage in the event that such environmental liabilities arise.
new accounting pronouncements for a discussion of the new accounting pronouncements that may have an effect on our consolidated financial statements (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).
inflation substantially all of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations over a base amount. in addition, many of our leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed increases. we believe that inflationary increases in costs may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and operating expense escalations.

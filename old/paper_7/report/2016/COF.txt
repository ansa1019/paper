our common equity tier 1 capital ratio as calculated under the basel iii standardized approach, including transition provisions, was 10.1% and 11.1% as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. see "md&a-capital management" below for additional information.
on june 29, 2016, we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion in shares of our common stock ("2016 stock repurchase program") from the third quarter of 2016 through the end of the second quarter of 2017. through the end of 2016, we repurchased approximately $2.1 billion of common stock as part of the 2016 stock repurchase program and expect to complete the 2016 stock repurchase program by the end of the second quarter of 2017. see "md&a-capital management" below for additional information.
below are additional highlights of our performance in 2016. these highlights are generally based on a comparison between the results of 2016 and 2015, except as otherwise noted. the changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our financial condition and credit performance as of december 31, 2016 compared to our financial condition and credit performance as of december 31, 2015. we provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the sections following this "executive summary and business outlook."

total company performance
•   earnings: our net income decreased by $299 million to $3.8 billion in 2016 compared to 2015. the decrease was primarily due to:
◦   higher provision for credit losses driven by higher charge-offs in our credit card, taxi medallion, and oil and gas lending portfolios, as well as larger allowance builds in our credit card and auto loan portfolios; and
◦   higher operating and marketing expenses associated with loan growth, as well as continued investments in technology and infrastructure.
these higher expenses were partially offset by:
◦   higher interest income due to growth in our credit card and commercial loan portfolios.
•   loans held for investment:
◦   period-end loans held for investment increased by $15.7 billion to $245.6 billion as of december 31, 2016 from december 31, 2015 primarily driven by growth in our credit card, auto and commercial loan portfolios, partially offset by the continued run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio.
◦   average loans held for investment increased by $22.5 billion to $233.3 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by continued growth in our commercial, credit card and auto loan portfolios, including loans acquired in the hfs acquisition, partially offset by the continued run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio.
•   net charge-off and delinquency metrics: our net charge-off rate increased by 42 basis points to 2.17% in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to:
◦   growth and seasoning of recent credit card loan originations; and
◦   rising losses in our taxi medallion and oil and gas lending portfolios.
these increases were partially offset by:
◦   continued growth in our domestic credit card loan portfolio.
our 30+ day delinquency rate increased by 27 basis points to 3.27% as of december 31, 2016 from december 31, 2015, primarily due to growth and seasoning of recent credit card loan originations, partially offset by continued growth in our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios.
we provide additional information on our credit quality metrics below under "md&a-business segment financial performance" and "md&a -credit risk profile."
•   allowance for loan and lease losses: our allowance for loan and lease losses increased by $1.4 billion to $6.5 billion as of december 31, 2016 from december 31, 2015, and the allowance coverage ratio increased by 42 basis points to 2.65% as of december 31, 2016 from december 31, 2015. the increases were primarily driven by:
◦   continued growth and seasoning in our credit card loan portfolio;
◦   continued growth in our auto loan portfolio, increasing loss expectations on recent originations and a build reflecting a change in accounting estimate of the timing of charge-offs of bankrupt accounts; and
◦   continued adverse industry conditions impacting our taxi medallion and oil and gas lending portfolios in our commercial banking business.
business outlook we discuss below our current expectations regarding our total company performance over the near-term based on market conditions, the regulatory environment and our business strategies as of the time we filed this annual report on form 10-k. the statements contained in this section are based on our current expectations regarding our outlook for our financial results and business strategies. our expectations take into account, and should be read in conjunction with, our expectations regarding economic trends and
37      capital one financial corporation (cof)
analysis of our business as discussed in "part i-item 1. business" and "part ii-item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of this report. certain statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. actual results could differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements. except as otherwise disclosed, forward-looking statements do not reflect:
•   any change in current dividend or repurchase strategies;
•   the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or similar transactions that have not been previously disclosed; or
•   any changes in laws, regulations or regulatory interpretations, in each case after the date as of which such statements are made.
see "part i-item 1. business-forward-looking statements" in this report for more information on the forward-looking statements included in this report and "part i-item 1a. risk factors" in this report for factors that could materially influence our results.
we believe we are positioned to deliver attractive growth and returns, as well as significant capital distribution, subject to regulatory approval.
we have improved efficiency by growing revenues and managing costs across the company, realizing analog cost savings and other efficiency gains as we become more digital. we expect that our near-term annual efficiency ratio, excluding adjusting items, will be in the 52%s, plus or minus a reasonable margin of volatility. over the longer-term, we believe that we should be able to achieve gradual efficiency improvement, driven by growth and digital productivity gains.
we expect our strong growth over the last two years puts us in a position to deliver solid eps growth in 2017, excluding adjusting items, assuming no substantial change in the broader credit and economic cycles.
we believe our actions have created a well-positioned balance sheet with strong capital and liquidity. pursuant to our approved 2016 capital plan, our board of directors has authorized repurchases of up to $2.5 billion of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2017. we reduced our net share count by 47 million shares in 2016. the timing and exact amount of any common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including market conditions, opportunities for growth, utilizing rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. see "md&a-capital management-dividend policy and stock purchases" for more information.
consolidated results of operations the section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance for 2016 and 2015. we provide a discussion of our business segment results in the following section, "md&a-business segment financial performance." you should read this section together with our "md&a-executive summary and business outlook," where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations.
net interest income net interest income represents the difference between the interest income, including certain fees, earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense on our interest-bearing liabilities. interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets, while our interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, and other borrowings. generally, we include in interest income any past due fees on loans that we deem collectible. our net interest margin, based on our consolidated results, represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the notional impact of non-interest-bearing funding. we expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

(1)   past due fees included in interest income totaled approximately $1.5 billion in 2016 and $1.4 billion in both 2015 and 2014.
(2)   some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our commercial banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory rate of 35% with offsetting reclassifications to the other category.
(3)   interest income and interest expense and the calculation of average yields on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities include the impact of hedge accounting.

net interest income increased by $2.0 billion to $20.9 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily driven by:
•   growth in our credit card and commercial loan portfolios, including loans acquired from the hfs acquisition; and
•   higher yields as a result of higher interest rates.
net interest margin increased by 12 basis points to 6.78% in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily driven by:
•   continued growth in our credit card loan portfolio; and
•   continued run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio in our consumer banking business.
this increase was partially offset by:
•   the impact of loans acquired from the hfs acquisition, which generally have lower net interest margins compared to our total company portfolio; and
•   margin compression in our auto loan portfolio.
net interest income increased by $1.0 billion to $18.8 billion in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase was primarily driven by growth in our credit card and commercial loan portfolios, as well as our auto loan portfolio in our consumer banking business. net interest margin decreased by 1 basis point to 6.66% in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily driven by:
•   the decline of yields in our auto, commercial, credit card and investment securities portfolios.
the decrease was substantially offset by:
•   continued growth in our domestic credit card loan portfolio and the continued run-off of the acquired home loan portfolio in our consumer banking business; and
•   lower wholesale funding costs.
table 2 displays the change in our net interest income between periods and the extent to which the variance is attributable to:

(1)   we calculate the change in interest income and interest expense separately for each item. the portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate is allocated proportionately when the calculation results in a positive value. when the portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate results in a negative value, the total amount is allocated to volume or rate, depending on which amount is positive.
(2)   some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our commercial banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory rate of 35% with offsetting reclassifications to the other category.
non-interest income non-interest income primarily consists of interchange fees net of rewards expense, service charges and other customer-related fees and other non-interest income. other non-interest income includes the pre-tax net benefit (provision) for mortgage representation and warranty losses related to continuing operations, gains and losses on free-standing derivatives not accounted for in hedge accounting relationships and hedge ineffectiveness.

__________
(1)   we made certain non-interest income reclassifications in the fourth quarter of 2016 to conform to the current period presentation. the primary net effects of the reclassifications for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 were (i) increases to service charges and other customer-related fees of $141 million for both periods and (ii) decreases to other non-interest income of $168 million and $187 million, respectively. we have also consolidated the non-interest income presentation of other-than-temporary impairment ("otti") with net realized gains or losses from investment securities into a new net securities gains (losses) line. see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" for additional information.
(2)   represents the benefit (provision) for mortgage representation and warranty losses recorded in continuing operations.
non-interest income increased by $49 million to $4.6 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by:
•   an increase in interchange fees driven by higher purchase volume in our credit card business, net of rewards expense from the continued expansion of our rewards franchise; and
•   higher revenue attributable to our multifamily business in our commercial banking business.
these increases were partially offset by:
•   lower service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to the exit of our legacy payment protection products in our domestic card business during the first quarter of 2016.
non-interest income increased by $107 million to $4.6 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily driven by:
•   an increase in interchange fees due to higher purchase volume in our credit card business.
this increase was partially offset by:
•   increased rewards expense due to a greater proportion of customers with rewards coupled with increased spend on products with higher rewards; and
•   lower service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to the continued run-off of our payment protection products in our domestic card business.
provision for credit losses our provision for credit losses in each period is driven by net charge-offs, changes to the allowance for loan and lease losses and changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. we recorded a provision for credit losses of $6.5 billion, $4.5 billion and $3.5 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the provision for credit losses as a percentage of net interest income was 30.9%, 24.1% and 19.9% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
42      capital one financial corporation (cof)
our provision for credit losses increased by $1.9 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by:
•   higher charge-offs and a larger allowance build in our credit card loan portfolio due to growth and portfolio seasoning;
•   higher charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio as a result of continued adverse industry conditions impacting our taxi medallion and oil and gas lending portfolios; and
•   higher allowance in our auto loan portfolio due to continued loan growth, increasing loss expectations on recent originations and a build reflecting a change in accounting estimate of the timing of charge-offs of bankrupt accounts.
the increase in provision for credit losses of $995 million in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily driven by:
•   a larger allowance build in our domestic credit card loan portfolio in 2015 due to continued loan growth coupled with our expectations for rising charge-off rates; and
•   a larger build in both the allowance and reserve for unfunded lending commitments resulting from adverse market conditions impacting our oil and gas portfolio and taxi medallion lending portfolio in our commercial banking business.
we provide additional information on the provision for credit losses and changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses within "md&a-credit risk profile," "note 4-loans" and "note 5-allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments." for information on the allowance methodology for each of our loan categories, see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies."
non-interest expense non-interest expense consists of ongoing operating expenses, such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, professional services, communications and data processing expenses and other non-interest expenses, as well as marketing costs and amortization of intangibles.

(1)   we made certain non-interest expense reclassifications in the fourth quarter of 2016. the net effects of the reclassifications for the year ended 2015 and year ended 2014 were increased communications and data processing expense by $172 million and $163 million, respectively, with corresponding decreases to professional services. see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" for additional information.
non-interest expense increased by $562 million to $13.6 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to:
•   higher operating and marketing expenses associated with loan growth, as well as continued investments in technology and infrastructure;
43      capital one financial corporation (cof)
•   higher bank optimization charges; and
•   higher fdic surcharges and premiums.
non-interest expense increased by $816 million to $13.0 billion in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase was primarily due to:
•   higher personnel expenses and charges for severance and related benefits pursuant to our ongoing benefit programs and certain site closures, as a result of the realignment of our workforce;
•   higher operating and marketing expenses associated with loan growth, as well as acquisition and operating expenses related to the hfs acquisition; and
•   continued technology and infrastructure investments.
these increases in 2015 compared to 2014 were partially offset by a decline in the amortization of intangibles.
income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax income (loss) from discontinued operations consists of results from the discontinued mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit, greenpoint mortgage funding, inc. ("greenpoint") and the discontinued manufactured housing operations of greenpoint credit, llc, a subsidiary of greenpoint, both of which were acquired as part of the north fork bancorporation, inc. ("north fork") acquisition in december 2006. loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $19 million in 2016, compared to income of $38 million in 2015 and income of $5 million in 2014. we recorded a provision net of tax for mortgage representation and warranty reserve of $13 million ($21 million before tax) in 2016, compared to benefit net of tax of $41 million ($64 million before tax) in 2015 and a benefit net of tax of $4 million ($7 million before tax) in 2014.
we provide additional information on the discontinued operations in "note 2-discontinued operations" and on the net benefit (provision) for mortgage representation and warranty losses and the related reserve for representation and warranty claims in "md&a-consolidated balance sheets analysis-mortgage representation and warranty reserve" and "note 19-commitments, contingencies, guarantees and others."
income taxes we recorded income tax provisions of $1.7 billion (31.3% effective income tax rate), $1.9 billion (31.8% effective income tax rate) and $2.1 billion (32.7% effective income tax rate) in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations varies between periods due, in part, to fluctuations in our pre-tax earnings, which affects the relative tax benefit of tax-exempt income, tax credits and other permanent tax items.
the decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily due to lower income before taxes and increased tax credits. this decrease was partially offset by reduced discrete tax benefits and a reduced benefit of lower taxed foreign earnings.
the decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2015, compared to 2014, was primarily due to lower income before taxes, higher discrete tax benefits and increased net tax credits. this decrease was partially offset by a reduced benefit of lower taxed foreign earnings.
we recorded net discrete tax benefits of $2 million and $15 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and net discrete tax expenses of $33 million in 2014. our effective income tax rate, excluding the impact of discrete tax items discussed above, was 31.3%, 32.0% and 32.2% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
we provide additional information on items affecting our income taxes and effective tax rate under "note 16-income taxes."

consolidated balance sheets analysis total assets increased by $23.0 billion to $357.0 billion as of december 31, 2016 from december 31, 2015, primarily due to:
•   an increase of $15.7 billion in loans held for investment primarily driven by growth in our credit card, auto and commercial loan portfolios, partially offset by the continued run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio.
total liabilities increased by $22.8 billion to $309.5 billion as of december 31, 2016, primarily driven by:
•   an increase in deposits primarily driven by the issuance of brokered deposits and growth in our consumer banking business.
stockholders' equity increased by $230 million to $47.5 billion as of december 31, 2016, primarily due to:
•   our net income of $3.8 billion in 2016; and
•   $1.1 billion of proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock.
these increases were partially offset by:
•   $3.7 billion of share repurchases under our 2015 and 2016 stock repurchase programs; and
•   $1.0 billion of dividend payments to our common and preferred stockholders.
the following is a discussion of material changes in the major components of our assets and liabilities during 2016. period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities that are intended to ensure the adequacy of capital while managing the liquidity requirements of the company and our customers and our market risk exposure in accordance with our risk appetite.
investment securities our investment portfolio consists primarily of the following: u.s. treasury securities; u.s. government-sponsored enterprise or agency ("agency") and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities ("rmbs"); agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities ("cmbs"); other asset-backed securities ("abs"); and other securities. the carrying value of our investments in u.s. treasury and agency securities represented 91% and 90% of our total investment securities as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
the fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio was $40.7 billion as of december 31, 2016, an increase of $1.7 billion from $39.1 billion as of december 31, 2015. the fair value of our held to maturity securities portfolio was $26.2 billion as of december 31, 2016, an increase of $879 million from $25.3 billion as of december 31, 2015. the increase in the fair value of both of these portfolios was primarily driven by purchase volume activities, partially offset by decreases in fair value due to higher interest rates.
gross unrealized gains on our available for sale securities portfolio decreased to $539 million as of december 31, 2016 compared to $578 million as of december 31, 2015 and gross unrealized losses on this portfolio increased to $535 million as of december 31, 2016 compared to $321 million as of december 31, 2015, both of which were primarily driven by an increase in interest rates. of the $535 million gross unrealized losses as of december 31, 2016, $116 million was related to securities that had been in a loss position for 12 months or longer. we provide information on otti recognized in earnings on our investment securities above in "md&a-consolidated results of operations-non-interest income."

deposits our deposits represent our largest source of funding for our operations and provide a consistent source of low-cost funds. total deposits increased by $19.0 billion to $236.8 billion as of december 31, 2016 from december 31, 2015. the increase in deposits was primarily driven by the issuance of brokered deposits and growth in our consumer banking business. we provide information on the composition of our deposits, average outstanding balances, interest expense and yield in "md&a-liquidity risk profile."
securitized debt obligations securitized debt obligations increased to $18.8 billion as of december 31, 2016, from $16.2 billion as of december 31, 2015, as debt issuances exceeded maturities during 2016. we provide additional information on our borrowings in "md&a-liquidity risk profile" and in "note 9-deposits and borrowings."
other debt other debt, which consists primarily of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, senior and subordinated notes, and federal home loan banks ("fhlb") advances, totaled $41.6 billion as of december 31, 2016, of which $40.6 billion represented long-term debt and the remainder represented short-term borrowings. other debt totaled $42.9 billion as of december 31, 2015, of which $42.0 billion represented long-term debt and the remainder represented short-term borrowings.

the decrease in other debt of $1.3 billion in 2016 was primarily attributable to a decrease in our fhlb advances outstanding, partially offset by an increase in our senior and subordinated notes. we provide additional information on our borrowings in "md&a-liquidity risk profile" and in "note 9-deposits and borrowings."
mortgage representation and warranty reserve we acquired three subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold these loans to various purchasers, including purchasers who created securitization trusts. these subsidiaries are capital one home loans, llc, which was acquired in february 2005; greenpoint, which was acquired in december 2006 as part of the north fork acquisition; and ccb, which was acquired in february 2009 and subsequently merged into cona.
we have established representation and warranty reserves for losses associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable, including both litigation and non-litigation liabilities. these reserves are reported on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities. the reserve setting process relies heavily on estimates, which are inherently uncertain, and requires judgment. we evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis. we build our representation and warranty reserves through the provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses, which we report in our consolidated statements of income as a component of non-interest income for loans originated and sold by ccb and capital one home loans, llc and as a component of discontinued operations for loans originated and sold by greenpoint. the aggregate reserve for all three entities totaled $630 million as of december 31, 2016, compared to $610 million as of december 31, 2015.
as part of our business planning processes, we have considered various outcomes relating to the future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying an incremental reserve under applicable accounting standards. our current best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond what was in our reserve as of december 31, 2016, is approximately $1.5 billion, a decline from our estimate of $1.6 billion as of december 31, 2015. the decrease in this estimate was primarily driven by favorable rulings in representation and warranty-related litigation.
we provide additional information related to the representation and warranty reserve, including factors that may impact the adequacy of the reserve and the ultimate amount of losses incurred by our subsidiaries, in "note 19-commitments, contingencies, guarantees and others."
deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of future reversals of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management's judgment that realization is more likely than not. we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of expected taxable income from all sources, including taxable income in carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. these sources of income rely heavily on estimates. we use our historical experience and our short and long-range business forecasts to provide insight.
as of december 31, 2016, we have recorded deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowances, of approximately $4.3 billion, which is an increase of $648 million from december 31, 2015. we have recorded a valuation allowance of $179 million and $166 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we expect to fully realize the 2016 net deferred tax asset amounts in future periods. if changes in circumstances lead us to change our judgment about our ability to realize deferred tax assets in future years, we will adjust our valuation allowances in the period that our change in judgment occurs and record a corresponding increase or charge to income.
we provide additional information on income taxes in "md&a-consolidated results of operations" and in "note 16-income taxes."

off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, we engage in certain activities that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, generally referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements. these activities typically involve transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities ("vies") as well as other arrangements, such as letter of credits, loan commitments and guarantees, to meet the financing needs of our customers and support their ongoing operations. we provide additional information regarding these types of activities in the "md&a-liquidity risk profile" as well as "note 6-variable interest entities and securitizations" and "note 19-commitments, contingencies, guarantees and others."
business segment financial performance our principal operations are currently organized into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking. the operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized corporate treasury group, are included in the other category.
the results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources.we may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. our business segment results are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. we use an internal management and reporting process to derive our business segment results. our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. total interest income and net fees are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. the net interest income of each segment reflects the results of our funds transfer pricing process, which is primarily based on a matched maturity method that takes into consideration of market interest rates. our funds transfer pricing process provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our consumer banking and commercial banking businesses, and a funds charge for the use of funds by each segment. the allocation process is unique to each business segment and acquired businesses. we regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods.
we refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our "managed" presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on u.s. gaap. there is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to u.s. gaap; therefore, the managed presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial services companies. in addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with u.s. gaap.
below we summarize our business segment results for 2016, 2015 and 2014 and provide a comparative discussion of these results, as well as changes in our financial condition and credit performance metrics as of december 31, 2016 compared to december 31, 2015. we also provide information on the outlook for each of our business segments. we provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated results in "note 18-business segments."

(1)   total net revenue (loss) consists of net interest income and non-interest income.
(2)   net income (loss) for our business segments and the other category is based on income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax.
(3)   some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our commercial banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate of 35% with offsetting reclassifications to the other category.
(4)   the other category includes the residual impact of the allocation of our centralized corporate treasury group activities, unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments and other items as described in "note 18-business segments."
credit card business the primary sources of revenue for our credit card business are interest income, net interchange income and fees collected from customers. expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses.
our credit card business generated net income from continuing operations of $2.2 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

(1)   we recognize billed finance charges and fee income on open-ended loans in accordance with the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements and estimate the uncollectible amount on a quarterly basis. the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees is reflected as a reduction in revenue and is not included in our net charge-offs. total net revenue was reduced by $1.1 billion, $732 million and $645 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees and related losses. the finance charge and fee reserve totaled $402 million and $262 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
(2)   period-end loans held for investment and average loans held for investment include billed finance charges and fees, net of the estimated uncollectible amount.
(3)   average yield on loans held for investment is calculated by dividing interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. interest income excludes various allocations including funds transfer pricing that assigns certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses attributable to each business segment.
(4)   total net revenue margin is calculated by dividing total net revenue for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. interest income also includes interest income on loans held for sale.
(5)   purchase volume consists of purchase transactions, net of returns, for the period for loans both classified as held for investment and held for sale. excludes cash advance and balance transfer transactions.
(6)   allowance coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the period-end allowance for loan and lease losses by period-end loans held for investment.
key factors affecting the results of our credit card business for 2016 compared to 2015, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015 include the following:
•   net interest income: net interest income increased by $1.5 billion to $12.6 billion in 2016 primarily driven by loan growth in our domestic card business.
•   non-interest income: non-interest income was flat at $3.4 billion in 2016 as an increase in interchange fees driven by higher purchase volume was largely offset by:
◦   higher rewards expense from the continued expansion of our rewards franchise; and
◦   lower service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to the exit of our legacy payment protection products in our domestic card business during the first quarter of 2016.
•   provision for credit losses: the provision for credit losses increased by $1.5 billion to $4.9 billion in 2016 primarily driven by higher charge-offs and a larger allowance build due to continued loan growth and portfolio seasoning.
•   non-interest expense: non-interest expense increased by $201 million to $7.7 billion in 2016 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses associated with loan growth as well as continued investments in technology, partially offset by operating efficiencies.
•   loans held for investment: period-end loans held for investment increased by $9.4 billion to $105.6 billion as of december 31, 2016 from december 31, 2015, and average loans held for investment increased by $9.8 billion to $96.6 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, both primarily due to continued loan growth in our domestic card business.
•   net charge-off and delinquency metrics: the net charge-off rate increased by 73 basis points to 4.09% in 2016 compared to 2015, and the 30+ day delinquency rate increased by 54 basis points to 3.94% as of december 31, 2016 from december 31, 2015. these increases were primarily driven by growth and seasoning of credit card loan originations, partially offset by continued growth in our domestic credit card loan portfolio.
key factors affecting the results of our credit card business for 2015 compared to 2014, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 include the following:

•   net interest income: net interest income increased by $851 million to $11.2 billion in 2015 primarily driven by loan growth in our domestic card business.
•   non-interest income: non-interest income increased by $110 million to $3.4 billion in 2015. the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in interchange fees driven by higher purchase volume, partially offset by:
◦   increased rewards expense due to a greater proportion of customers with rewards coupled with increased spend on products with higher rewards; and
◦   lower service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to the continued run-off of our payment protection products in our domestic card business.
•   provision for credit losses: the provision for credit losses increased by $667 million to $3.4 billion in 2015 primarily driven by:
◦   a larger allowance build in our domestic credit card loan portfolio in 2015 due to continued loan growth coupled with our expectations for rising charge-off rates; and
◦   higher charge-offs as new loan balances season.
•   non-interest expense: non-interest expense increased by $439 million to $7.5 billion in 2015. the increase was due to higher operating and marketing expenses associated with loan growth, partially offset by operating efficiencies and lower intangibles amortization expense.
•   loans held for investment: period-end loans held for investment increased by $10.2 billion to $96.1 billion as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014, and average loans held for investment increased by $7.8 billion to $86.7 billion in 2015 compared to 2014. the increases were primarily due to loan growth in our domestic credit card loan portfolio, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates in our international card loan portfolio driven by the strengthening of the u.s. dollar in 2015.
•   net charge-off and delinquency statistics: the net charge-off rate decreased by 10 basis points to 3.36% in 2015 compared to 2014 driven by our international card loan portfolio, which benefited from growth in our international portfolio in canada. the 30+ day delinquency rate increased by 10 basis points to 3.40% as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014 due to the seasoning of our domestic credit card portfolio growth which has begun to put upward pressure on delinquencies.
domestic card business expectations in our domestic card business, we expect the full-year 2017 charge-off rate will be in the mid-four percent range, with quarterly variability. the impact of the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loans season and become a larger portion of our overall portfolio is expected to moderate in 2017 and only have a modest effect beyond that.
domestic card business domestic card generated net income from continuing operations of $2.1 billion in 2016 and $2.2 billion in both 2015 and 2014. over 2016, 2015 and 2014, domestic card accounted for greater than 90% of both total net revenues and net income of our credit card business.

(1)   we recognize billed finance charges and fee income on open-ended loans in accordance with the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements and estimate the uncollectible amount on a quarterly basis. the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees is reflected as a reduction in revenue and is not included in our net charge-offs.
(2)   period-end loans held for investment and average loans held for investment include billed finance charges and fees, net of the estimated uncollectible amount.
(3)   average yield on loans held for investment is calculated by dividing interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. interest income excludes various allocations including funds transfer pricing that assigns certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses attributable to each business segment.
(4)   total net revenue margin is calculated by dividing total net revenue for the period by average loans held for investment during the period.
(5)   purchase volume consists of purchase transactions, net of returns, for the period for loans both classified as held for investment and held for sale. excludes cash advance and balance transfer transactions.
(6)   allowance coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the period-end allowance for loan and lease losses by period-end loans held for investment.
because our domestic card business accounts for the substantial majority of our credit card business, the key factors driving the results are similar to the key factors affecting our total credit card business. net income for our domestic card business decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily driven by higher provision for credit losses and higher operating expenses associated with continued loan growth, partially offset by higher net interest income resulting from loan growth.
net income for our domestic card business remained flat in 2015 compared to 2014 as continued loan growth drove increases in revenue, provision for credit losses, operating and marketing expenses.

consumer banking business segment expectations in our consumer banking business, we expect that decreasing margins and modestly rising charge-offs in the auto finance business, as well as continued run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio, will negatively affect consumer banking revenues, efficiency ratio and net income, even as we continue to manage costs.
consumer banking business the primary sources of revenue for our consumer banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income from service charges and customer-related fees. expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses.

(1)   average consumer banking loans held for investment includes purchased credit-impaired loans ("pci loans") of $16.4 billion, $20.7 billion and $25.6 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. period-end consumer banking loans held for investment includes pci loans with carrying values of $14.5 billion and $18.6 billion as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. see "md&amp;a-glossary and acronyms" for the definition of "pci loans."
(2)   average yield on loans held for investment is calculated by dividing interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. interest income excludes various allocations including funds transfer pricing that assigns certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses attributable to each business segment.
(3)   see "md&amp;a-credit risk profile" and "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" for additional information on the impact of pci loans on our credit quality metrics.
(4)   nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, real estate owned ("reo") and other foreclosed assets. the total nonperforming asset rate is calculated based on total nonperforming assets divided by the combined period-end total loans held for investment, reo and other foreclosed assets. prior to q4 2016, the nonperforming asset rate for our consumer banking business excluded the impact of reos related to our acquired home loan portfolio which, if included, would increase the nonperforming asset rate by approximately 10 basis points in each of the prior periods presented.
(5)   allowance coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the period-end allowance for loan and lease losses by period-end loans held for investment.
(6)   excluding the impact of the pci home loan amounts in footnote 1 above, the allowance coverage ratios for our home loan portfolio and total consumer banking were 0.51% and 1.83%, respectively, as of december 31, 2016, compared to 0.50% and 1.60%, respectively, as of december 31, 2015.
key factors affecting the results of our consumer banking business for 2016 compared to 2015, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015 include the following:
•   net interest income: net interest income was flat at $5.8 billion in 2016 as growth in our auto loan portfolio was offset by the continued run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio and margin compression in our auto loan portfolio.
◦   consumer banking loan yield increased by 8 basis points to 6.3% in 2016 compared to 2015. the increase was primarily driven by changes in the product mix in consumer banking as a result of the continued run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio and growth in our auto loan portfolio, partially offset by declining yield in our auto loan portfolio.
◦   average yield on auto loans decreased by 33 basis points to 7.7% in 2016, primarily attributable to a higher proportion of prime auto loans in 2016 compared to 2015.
◦   the average yield on our home loan portfolio increased by 9 basis points to 4.0% in 2016 primarily as a result of higher yield on our acquired home loan portfolio.
•   non-interest income: non-interest income was substantially flat at $733 million in 2016.
55      capital one financial corporation (cof)
•   provision for credit losses: the provision for credit losses increased by $236 million to $1.1 billion in 2016 primarily driven by:
◦   a higher allowance in our auto loan portfolio due to continued loan growth, increasing loss expectations on recent originations and a build reflecting a change in accounting estimate of the timing of charge-offs of bankrupt accounts; and
◦   higher charge-offs in our auto loan portfolio due to seasoning of recent growth.
•   non-interest expense: non-interest expense increased by $113 million to $4.1 billion in 2016 primarily due to:
◦   higher operating expenses driven by growth in our auto loan portfolio; and
◦   increased marketing expenses in our retail banking business.
•   loans held for investment: period-end loans held for investment increased by $2.7 billion to $73.1 billion as of december 31, 2016 from december 31, 2015, and average loans held for investment increased by $272 million to $71.4 billion in 2016 compared to 2015. the increases were primarily due to growth in our auto loan portfolio, partially offset by the continued run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio.
•   deposits: period-end deposits increased by $9.2 billion to $181.9 billion as of december 31, 2016 from december 31, 2015 as a result of strong growth in our deposit products that are sold directly to both existing and new customers.
•   net charge-off and delinquency metrics: the net charge-off rate increased by 12 basis points to 1.15% in 2016 compared to 2015. the increase reflects the greater portion of auto loans in our total consumer banking loan portfolio, which generally have higher charge-off rates than other products within this portfolio. the 30+ day delinquency rate was flat at 4.67% as of both december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015.
key factors affecting the results of our consumer banking business for 2015 compared to 2014 and changes in financial condition and credit performance between december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 include the following:
•   net interest income: net interest income remained flat at $5.8 billion in 2015 as the higher net interest income generated by the growth in our auto loan portfolio was partially offset by lower net interest income from our home loan portfolio attributable to the continued run-off of the acquired portfolio and margin compression in auto loans.
◦   consumer banking loan yield remained flat at 6.3% in 2015 as the decrease in average loan yield in our auto loan portfolio was offset by changes in the product mix in consumer banking as a result of growth in our auto loan portfolio and the continued run-off of the acquired home loan portfolio.
◦   the increase in our auto loan portfolio in relation to our total consumer banking loan portfolio drove an increase in the total consumer banking yield, even as the average yield on auto loans decreased by 65 basis points to 8.0% in 2015. this decrease was primarily attributable to a shift to a higher proportion of prime auto loans and continued competition across the auto business.
◦   the average yield on the home loan portfolio increased by 6 basis points to 3.9% in 2015, as a result of higher yield on our acquired home loan portfolio.
•   non-interest income: non-interest income increased by $26 million to $710 million in 2015 primarily due to the gain recognized on loans originated and sold within our home loan portfolio.
•   provision for credit losses: the provision for credit losses increased by $116 million to $819 million in 2015 driven by an allowance build across our consumer banking loan portfolios, coupled with higher net charge-offs due to continued growth in our auto loan portfolio.
•   non-interest expense: non-interest expense increased by $157 million to $4.0 billion in 2015 largely due to increased operating expenses due to continued technology and infrastructure investments in our retail banking business and growth in our auto loan portfolio.
•   loans held for investment: period-end loans held for investment decreased by $1.1 billion to $70.4 billion as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014 primarily due to the continued run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio, partially offset
56      capital one financial corporation (cof)
by growth in our auto loan portfolio. average loans held for investment were substantially flat, increasing by $186 million, or 0.3%, to $71.2 billion in 2015 compared to 2014.
•   deposits: period-end deposits increased by $4.6 billion to $172.7 billion as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014 as a result of strong growth in our deposit products, as well as modest growth in products sold through our local franchise.
•   net charge-off and delinquency statistics: the net charge-off rate increased by 8 basis points to 1.03% in 2015 compared to 2014. the 30+ day delinquency rate increased by 44 basis points to 4.67% as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014. the increases in the net charge-off and 30+ day delinquency rates reflected the continued run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio, which generally does not have charge-offs or delinquencies since these loans were recorded at fair value at acquisition, and a greater portion of auto loans in our portfolio, which have a higher charge-off and delinquency rate than other products within the total consumer banking loan portfolio.
commercial banking business the primary sources of revenue for our commercial banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income from customer fees and other transactions. because we have some investments that generate tax-exempt income or tax credits, we make certain reclassifications to our commercial banking business results to present revenues on a taxable-equivalent basis. expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses.
our commercial banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $575 million, $570 million and $659 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. table 11 summarizes the financial results of our commercial banking business and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.

(1)   some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our commercial banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate of 35% with offsetting reclassifications to the other category.
(2)   the provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. our reserve for unfunded lending commitments totaled $129 million, $161 million and $106 million as of december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
(3)   average commercial banking loans held for investment includes pci loans of $770 million, $215 million and $217 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. period-end commercial banking loans held for investment includes pci loans with carrying values of $613 million and $958 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. see "md&amp;a-glossary and acronyms" for the definition of "pci loans."
(4)   average yield on loans held for investment is calculated by dividing interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. interest income excludes various allocations including funds transfer pricing that assigns certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses attributable to each business segment.

key factors affecting the results of our commercial banking business for 2016 compared to 2015, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015 include the following:
•   net interest income: net interest income increased by $351 million to $2.2 billion in 2016 primarily driven by loan growth, including loans acquired in the hfs acquisition.
•   non-interest income: non-interest income increased by $91 million to $578 million in 2016 primarily driven by fee-based services, including impacts from the hfs acquisition, and products attributable to our multifamily finance business.
•   provision for credit losses: the provision for credit losses increased by $181 million to $483 million in 2016 primarily driven by higher charge-offs, partially offset by a smaller allowance build, due to continued adverse industry conditions impacting our taxi medallion and oil and gas lending portfolios.
•   non-interest expense: non-interest expense increased by $251 million to $1.4 billion in 2016 driven by higher operating expenses due to costs associated with the hfs acquisition and continued growth in our commercial banking business.
•   loans held for investment: period-end loans held for investment increased by $3.7 billion to $66.9 billion as of december 31, 2016 from december 31, 2015 driven by growth in our commercial loan portfolios. average loans held for investment increased by $12.5 billion to $65.2 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily driven by the hfs acquisition and growth in our commercial loan portfolios.
•   deposits: period-end deposits decreased by $391 million to $33.9 billion as of december 31, 2016 from december 31, 2015.
58      capital one financial corporation (cof)
•   net charge-off and nonperforming metrics: the net charge-off rate increased by 36 basis points to 0.45% in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting rising losses in our taxi medallion and oil and gas lending portfolios. increased credit risk rating downgrades in these same lending portfolios resulted in the nonperforming loan rate increasing by 66 basis points to 1.53% as of december 31, 2016 from december 31, 2015.
key factors affecting the results of our commercial banking business for 2015 compared to 2014, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 include the following:
•   net interest income: net interest income increased by $114 million to $1.9 billion in 2015. the increase was due to growth in commercial and industrial and commercial and multifamily real estate average loans, partially offset by lower loan yields driven by market and competitive pressures.
•   non-interest income: non-interest income increased by $37 million to $487 million in 2015 primarily driven by increased revenue from products and services provided to our commercial customers.
•   provision for credit losses: the provision for credit losses increased by $209 million to $302 million in 2015. the increase was primarily driven by a larger build in both the allowance and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments resulting from adverse market conditions impacting our oil and gas portfolio and taxi medallion lending portfolio.
•   non-interest expense: non-interest expense increased by $73 million to $1.2 billion in 2015 driven by higher operating expenses due to costs associated with the hfs acquisition and continued growth in our commercial banking business.
•   loans held for investment: period-end loans held for investment increased by $12.4 billion to $63.3 billion as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014 driven by the hfs acquisition as well as growth in our commercial and multifamily real estate loan portfolios. average loans held for investment increased by $4.9 billion to $52.8 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily driven by growth in our commercial and multifamily real estate loan portfolios.
•   deposits: period-end deposits increased by $2.3 billion to $34.3 billion as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014 driven by our strategy to strengthen existing relationships with and increase liquidity from our commercial customers.
•   net charge-off and nonperforming statistics: the net charge-off rate increased by 7 basis points to 0.09% in 2015 compared to 2014. the nonperforming loans rate increased by 53 basis points to 0.87% as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014. the increases in these rates reflect losses and credit risk rating downgrades in our oil and gas portfolio and taxi medallion lending portfolio.

(1)   some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our commercial banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate of 35% with offsetting reclassifications to the other category.
**   change is not meaningful.
net income from continuing operations recorded in the other category was $165 million in 2016 compared to $54 million in 2015. the increase in 2016 was primarily driven by:
•   higher net interest income due to balance sheet growth, as well as the impact of rates on our other treasury-related activities; and
•   lower restructuring charges for severance and related benefits pursuant to our ongoing benefit programs as a result of the realignment of our workforce.
these drivers were partially offset by:
•   higher bank optimization charges and an impairment charge associated with certain acquired intangible and software assets within non-interest expense;
•   lower non-interest income due to rate-driven hedge ineffectiveness; and
•   a reduced income tax benefit as a result of higher income before taxes and increased discrete tax expense, partially offset by increased tax credits.
net income from continuing operations recorded in the other category was $54 million in 2015 compared to $90 million in 2014. the reduction in net income in 2015 was primarily due to charges associated with:
•   severance and related benefits pursuant to our ongoing benefit program as a result of the realignment of our workforce; and
•   certain planned site closures.
these drivers were partially offset by higher discrete tax benefits and net tax credits.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses on the consolidated financial statements. understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. we provide a summary of our significant accounting policies under "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies."
we have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. these critical accounting policies govern:
•   loan loss reserves
•   asset impairment
•   fair value of financial instruments
•   representation and warranty reserves
•   customer rewards reserve we evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them, as necessary, based on changing conditions. management has discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors.
loan loss reserves we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses that represents management's estimate of incurred loan and lease losses inherent in our held-for-investment credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking loan portfolios as of each balance sheet date. we also separately reserve for binding unfunded lending commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees.
we build our allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments through the provision for credit losses. our provision for credit losses in each period is driven by charge-offs, changes to allowance for loan and lease losses, and changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. we recorded a provision for credit losses of $6.5 billion, $4.5 billion and $3.5 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
we have an established process, using analytical tools and management judgment, to determine our allowance for loan and lease losses. losses are inherent in our loan portfolio and we calculate the allowance for loan and lease losses by estimating incurred losses for segments of our loan portfolio with similar risk characteristics and record a provision for credit losses. the allowance totaled $6.5 billion as of december 31, 2016, compared to $5.1 billion as of december 31, 2015.
we review and assess our allowance methodologies and adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses on a quarterly basis. our assessment involves evaluating many factors including, but not limited to, historical loss and recovery experience, recent trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, risk ratings, the impact of bankruptcy filings, the value of collateral underlying secured loans, account seasoning, changes in our credit evaluation, underwriting and collection management policies, seasonality, general economic conditions, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and uncertainties in forecasting and modeling techniques used in estimating our allowance for loan and lease losses. key factors that have a significant impact on our allowance for loan and lease losses include assumptions about unemployment rates, home prices, and the valuation of commercial properties and other collateral, consumer real estate, and automobiles.
in addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we review and assess our estimate of probable losses related to binding unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit and financial guarantees, and unfunded loan commitments on a quarterly basis. the factors impacting our assessment generally align with those considered in our evaluation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial banking business. changes to the reserve for losses on unfunded lending commitments are recorded through the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income and to other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
although we examine a variety of externally available data, as well as our internal loan performance data, to determine our allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments, our estimation process is subject to risks and
61      capital one financial corporation (cof)
uncertainties, including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance. accordingly, our actual credit loss experience may not be in line with our expectations. we provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses for each of our loan portfolio segments in "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies." we provide information on the components of our allowance, disaggregated by impairment methodology, and changes in our allowance in "note 5-allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments."
finance charge and fee reserves finance charges and fees on credit card loans, net of amounts that we consider uncollectible, are included in loan receivables and revenue when the finance charges and fees are earned. we continue to accrue finance charges and fees on credit card loans until the account is charged-off; however, when we do not expect full payment of billed finance charges and fees, we reduce the balance of our credit card loan receivables by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue. total net revenue was reduced by $1.1 billion, $732 million and $645 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees. the finance charge and fee reserve totaled $402 million as of december 31, 2016, compared to $262 million as of december 31, 2015.
we review and assess the adequacy of the uncollectible finance charge and fee reserve on a quarterly basis. our methodology for estimating the uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees is consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for incurred losses on the principal portion of our credit card loan receivables.
asset impairment in addition to our loan portfolio, we review other assets for impairment on a regular basis in accordance with applicable impairment accounting guidance. this process requires significant management judgment and involves various estimates and assumptions. our investment securities, goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets excluding loans. accordingly, below we describe our process for assessing impairment of these assets and the key estimates and assumptions involved in this process.
investment securities we regularly review our investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment ("otti") using both quantitative and qualitative criteria. if we intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, the entire difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its fair value is recognized in income. if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost, we evaluate other quantitative and qualitative criteria to determine whether a credit loss exists. our evaluation requires significant management judgment and a consideration of many factors, including, but not limited to, the extent and duration of the impairment; the health of and specific prospects for the issuer, including whether the issuer has failed to make scheduled interest or principal payments; recent events specific to the issuer and/or industry to which the issuer belongs; the payment structure of the security; external credit ratings; the value of underlying collateral and current market conditions. quantitative criteria include assessing whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows. see "note 3-investment securities" for additional information.
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date.
goodwill totaled $14.5 billion as of both december 31, 2016 and 2015. intangible assets, which we report on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets, consist primarily of purchased credit card relationships ("pccr"), core deposit and other intangibles. the net carrying amount of intangible assets decreased to $665 million as of december 31, 2016, from $1.0 billion as of december 31, 2015 primarily due to amortization. goodwill and intangible assets together represented 4% and 5% of our total assets as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we did not recognize any goodwill impairment in 2016, 2015 or 2014. see "note 7-goodwill and intangible assets" for additional information.

goodwill we perform our goodwill impairment test annually on october 1 at a reporting unit level. we are also required to test goodwill for impairment whenever events or circumstances make it more-likely-than-not that impairment may have occurred. as of october 1, 2016, we had five reporting units which included domestic card, international card, auto, other consumer banking and commercial banking.
the goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. the first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. if the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step is not necessary. if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, then the second step, which requires measurement of any potential impairment, must be performed. the second step of goodwill impairment testing requires an extensive effort to build the specific reporting unit's balance sheet for the test based on applicable accounting guidance.
for the purpose of our goodwill impairment testing, we calculate the carrying amount of a reporting unit using an allocated capital approach based on each reporting unit's specific regulatory capital, economic capital requirements, and underlying risks. the carrying amount for a reporting unit is the sum of its respective capital requirements, goodwill and intangibles balances. we then compare the carrying amount to our total consolidated stockholders' equity to assess the reasonableness of our methodology. the total carrying amount of our five reporting units was $39.2 billion, as compared to consolidated stockholder's equity of $48.2 billion as of october 1, 2016. the $9.0 billion excess in consolidated stockholder's equity was primarily attributable to capital allocated to our other category, preferred stock and other future capital needs such as dividends and share buy-backs. there was no remaining unallocated equity after factoring in these items.
determining the fair value of a reporting unit and the associated assets, liabilities and intangible assets, is a subjective process that requires the use of estimates and the exercise of significant judgment. the fair value of the domestic card, auto, other consumer banking and commercial banking reporting units was calculated using a discounted cash flow ("dcf") calculation, a form of the income approach. this income approach calculation used projected cash flows based on each reporting unit's internal forecast and the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. our dcf analysis requires management to make estimates about future loan, deposit and revenue growth, as well as credit losses and capital rates. these cash flows and terminal values were then discounted using discount rates based on our external cost of equity with adjustments for the risk inherent in each reporting unit. discount rates used in 2016 ranged from 8% to 13%. the reasonableness of the dcf approach was assessed by reference to a market-based approach using comparable market multiples and recent market transactions where available. the results of the 2016 annual impairment test for the domestic card, auto, other consumer banking and commercial banking reporting units indicated that the estimated fair values of these four reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying amounts.
our international card businesses operate in canada and the united kingdom ("u.k.") and as of october 1, 2016, had goodwill of $913 million. as part of our internal analysis, management forecasted a decline in the excess of fair value above carrying value of the international card reporting unit as compared to the prior year. these declines were primarily attributable to the adverse changes in foreign exchange rates due to the general uncertainties following the u.k. referendum to leave the european union. although the referendum has raised uncertainties, we have not experienced any significant negative impacts to our results of operations in the u.k. attributable specifically to it, nor do we currently forecast significant changes to this business due to the referendum. our operations in canada continue to forecast loan growth and strong operating results. as a result of these uncertainties, management engaged an independent valuation specialist to assist in the determination of the international card reporting unit fair value for the 2016 goodwill impairment test. we employed both the dcf and the market approach to calculate the fair value of our international card reporting unit. the outputs from both methods were relatively consistent and indicated that the international card reporting unit's fair value exceed its carrying value by approximately 9%. as a result of this analysis, the second step of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary for our international card reporting unit.
during december 2016, subsequent to the annual goodwill impairment test described above, as a result of the evolution of the business and certain leadership changes in the overall credit card business, management re-evaluated the organizational structure of this business. we concluded the domestic and international card components of the credit card operating segment should be aggregated into a single reporting unit because they share similar economic characteristics, products, types of customers, operations, assets and other resources, and goodwill is recoverable from the businesses working in concert. the business has evolved since the international card reporting unit was created, in particular our canadian business now comprises the majority of the reporting unit's assets, such that there are now more shared characteristics and resources with our domestic operations, such as common technology platforms. as a result of this change, as of december 31, 2016, capital one had four reporting units: credit card, auto, other consumer banking and commercial banking for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment. as this change only
63      capital one financial corporation (cof)
impacted the two reporting units both under our credit card operating segment and did not impact the reporting units under the consumer banking or commercial banking operating segments, the goodwill amounts previously allocated to the international card reporting unit of $913 million and domestic card reporting unit of $4.1 billion were combined into the new credit card reporting unit. the change did not impact our operating segments and our chief executive officer ("ceo") continues to be the chief operating decision maker ("codm").
by definition, assumptions used in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit are judgmental and inherently uncertain. a significant change in the economic conditions of a reporting unit, such as declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, deterioration in market conditions, adverse estimates of regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of our reporting units to decline in the future, and increase the risk of a goodwill impairment charge to earnings in a future period.
intangible assets intangible assets with definitive useful lives are amortized over their estimated lives and evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset's or asset group's carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. an impairment loss, generally calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying amount. during 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of $17 million related to certain other intangibles. there were no meaningful intangible asset impairments in 2015 or 2014.
see "note 7-goodwill and intangible assets" for additional information.
fair value fair value, also referred to as an exit price, is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. the fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. this hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2: observable market-based inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 3: unobservable inputs the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted prices in active markets or observable market parameters. when quoted prices and observable data in active markets are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. changes in market conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value.
we have developed policies and procedures to determine when markets for our financial assets and liabilities are inactive if the level and volume of activity has declined significantly relative to normal conditions. if markets are determined to be inactive, it may be appropriate to adjust price quotes received. when significant adjustments are required to price quotes or inputs, it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based primarily on unobservable inputs.
significant judgment may be required to determine whether certain financial instruments measured at fair value are classified as level 2 or level 3. in making this determination, we consider all available information that market participants use to measure the fair value of the financial instrument, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used. based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category, judgments are made regarding the significance of the level 3 inputs to the instruments' fair value measurement in its entirety. if level 3 inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as level 3. the process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions. we discuss changes in the valuation inputs and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our
64      capital one financial corporation (cof)
financial instruments, including the extent to which we have relied on significant unobservable inputs to estimate fair value and our process for corroborating these inputs, in "note 17-fair value measurement."
fair value measurement we have a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable. our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties. our control processes include review and approval of new transaction types, price verification and review of valuation judgments, methods, models, process controls and results.
groups independent of our trading and investing functions participate in the review and validation process. tasks performed by these groups include periodic verification of fair value measurements to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable, including comparing prices from third-party pricing services to other available market information.
our fair value committee ("fvc"), which includes representation from business areas, risk management and finance divisions, provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment. the fvc regularly reviews and approves our fair valuations to ensure that our valuation practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance.
we have a model policy, established by an independent model risk office, which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for pricing and fair value measurements. the model risk office validates all models and provides ongoing monitoring of their performance.
the fair valuation governance process is set up in a manner that allows the chairperson of the fvc to escalate valuation disputes that cannot be resolved by the fvc to a more senior committee called the valuations advisory committee ("vac") for resolution. the vac is chaired by the chief financial officer and includes other members of senior management. the vac is only required to convene to review escalated valuation disputes.
representation and warranty reserve in connection with the sales of mortgage loans, certain subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about, among other things, the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, the loan's compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the purchaser, including underwriting guidelines and the ongoing existence of mortgage insurance, and the loan's compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws. we may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan, indemnify the investor or insurer, or reimburse the investor for losses incurred on the loan in the event of a material breach of contractual representations or warranties.
we have established representation and warranty reserves for losses that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary, including both litigation and non-litigation liabilities. the reserve-setting process relies heavily on estimates, which are inherently uncertain, and requires the application of judgment. in establishing the representation and warranty reserves, we rely on historical data and consider a variety of factors, depending on the category of purchaser. these factors include, but are not limited to, the historical relationship between loan losses and repurchase outcomes; the percentage of current and future loan defaults that we anticipate will result in repurchase requests over the lifetime of the loans; the percentage of those repurchase requests that we anticipate will result in actual repurchases; and estimated collateral valuations. we evaluate these factors and update our loss forecast models on a quarterly basis to estimate our lifetime liability.
our aggregate representation and warranty mortgage reserve, which we report as a component of other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, totaled $630 million and $610 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the adequacy of the reserve and the ultimate amount of losses incurred by us or one of our subsidiaries will depend on, among other things, actual future mortgage loan performance, the actual level of future repurchase and indemnification requests, the actual success rates of claimants, developments in litigation, actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions (including unemployment levels and housing prices).
as part of our business planning processes, we have considered various outcomes relating to the potential future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying an incremental accrual under applicable accounting standards. our current best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond what was in our reserve as of december 31, 2016 is approximately $1.5 billion, a decline from our estimate of $1.6 billion as of december 31, 2015. notwithstanding our ongoing

attempts to estimate a reasonably possible amount of future losses beyond our current accrual levels based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and our current estimate of the amount of reasonably possible losses. this estimate involves considerable judgment, and reflects that there is still significant uncertainty regarding the numerous factors that may impact the ultimate loss levels, including, but not limited to, anticipated litigation outcomes, future repurchase and indemnification claim levels, ultimate repurchase and indemnification rates, future mortgage loan performance levels, actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions (including unemployment levels and housing prices). in light of the significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability our subsidiaries may incur from these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period. see "note 19-commitments, contingencies, guarantees and others" for additional information.
customer rewards reserve we offer products, primarily credit cards, which include programs that allow members to earn rewards, in the form of points, that can be redeemed for cash (primarily in the form of statement credits), gift cards, airline tickets or merchandise, based on account activity. the amount of rewards that a customer earns varies based on the terms and conditions of the rewards program and product. the majority of our rewards do not expire and there is no limit on the number of rewards points an eligible card member can earn. customer rewards costs, which we generally record as an offset to interchange income, are driven by various factors, such as card member purchase volume, the terms and conditions of the rewards program and rewards redemption cost. we establish a customer rewards reserve that reflects management's judgment regarding rewards earned that are expected to be redeemed and the estimated redemption cost.
we use financial models to estimate ultimate redemption rates of rewards earned to date by current card members based on historical redemption trends, current enrollee redemption behavior, card product type, year of program enrollment, enrollment tenure and card spend levels. our current assumption is that the vast majority of all rewards earned will eventually be redeemed. we use a weighted-average cost per point redeemed during the previous twelve months, adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in redemption costs, including mix of rewards redeemed, to estimate future redemption costs. we continually evaluate our reserve and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, changes to the terms and conditions of the rewards program and other factors. changes in the ultimate redemption rate and weighted-average cost per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the reserve through the current period provision by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by card members as of the end of the reporting period. we recognized customer rewards expense of $3.2 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.0 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. our customer rewards liability, which is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, totaled $3.6 billion and $3.2 billion as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

capital management the level and composition of our capital are determined by multiple factors, including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements and internal risk-based capital assessments such as internal stress testing and economic capital. the level and composition of our capital may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments.
capital standards and prompt corrective action we are subject to capital adequacy standards adopted by the federal reserve, occ and fdic (collectively, the "federal banking agencies"), including the capital rules that implemented the basel iii capital framework ("basel iii capital rule") developed by the basel committee on banking supervision ("basel committee"). moreover, the banks, as insured depository institutions, are subject to pca capital regulations.
in july 2013, the federal banking agencies adopted the basel iii capital rule, which, in addition to implementing the basel iii capital framework, also implemented certain dodd-frank act and other capital provisions, and updated the pca capital framework to reflect the new regulatory capital minimums. the basel iii capital rule amended both the basel i and basel ii advanced approaches frameworks, established a new common equity tier 1 capital requirement and set higher minimum capital ratio requirements. we refer to the amended basel i framework as the "basel iii standardized approach," and the amended advanced approaches framework as the "basel iii advanced approaches."
at the end of 2012, we met one of the two independent eligibility criteria set by banking regulators for becoming subject to the advanced approaches capital rules. as a result, we have undertaken a multi-year process of implementing the advanced approaches regime for calculating risk-weighted assets and regulatory capital levels. we entered parallel run under advanced approaches on january 1, 2015, during which we are required to calculate capital ratios under both the basel iii standardized approach and the basel iii advanced approaches, though we continue to use the standardized approach for purposes of meeting regulatory capital requirements.
the basel committee has proposed, but has not finalized, changes to the basel iii capital framework. there is uncertainty around any final changes that the basel committee might adopt, which of those changes thereafter may be adopted in the united states, and how those changes may impact the basel iii standardized approach and the basel iii advanced approaches.
for additional information about the capital adequacy guidelines we are subject to, see "part 1-item 1. business-supervision and regulation."
the market risk rule supplements both the basel iii standardized approach and the basel iii advanced approaches by requiring institutions subject to the market risk rule to adjust their risk-based capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading portfolios. the market risk rule applies to institutions with aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to the lesser of (i) 10% or more of total assets or (ii) $1 billion or more. see "md&a-market risk profile" below for additional information. we began reporting risk-based capital ratios including market risk-weighted assets for the company and cona pursuant to the market risk rule for positions covered by such rule in the third quarter of 2016. this change did not have a material impact on the risk-based capital ratios of these two entities. as of december 31, 2016, cobna is not subject to the market risk rule.
table 13 provides a comparison of our regulatory capital ratios under the basel iii standardized approach subject to transition provisions, the regulatory minimum capital adequacy ratios and the pca well-capitalized level for each ratio (where applicable) as of december 31, 2016 and 2015.

(1)   capital ratios are calculated based on the basel iii standardized approach framework, subject to applicable transition provisions, such as the inclusion of the unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale included in aoci and adjustments related to intangible assets other than goodwill. the inclusion of aoci and the adjustments related to intangible assets are phased-in at 40% for 2015, 60% for 2016, 80% for 2017 and 100% for 2018.
(2)   common equity tier 1 capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on common equity tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets.
(3)   tier 1 capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets.
(4)   total capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on total capital divided by risk-weighted assets.
(5)   tier 1 leverage ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average assets.
(6)   supplementary leverage ratio ("slr") is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure.
in addition to the above statutory capital ratios, we also disclose a non-gaap tce ratio in "part ii-item 6. summary of selected financial data." this capital measure is not necessarily comparable to similarly-titled capital measures reported by other companies. we provide information on the calculation of this ratio in "md&a-table f-reconciliation of non-gaap measures and calculation of regulatory capital measures."
the company exceeded the minimum capital requirements and each of the banks exceeded the minimum regulatory requirements and were well capitalized under pca requirements as of both december 31, 2016 and 2015.
the basel iii capital rule requires banks to maintain a capital conservation buffer of common equity tier 1 capital of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum ratio and an incremental countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% of common equity tier 1 capital to be set at the discretion of the federal banking agencies (currently zero percent as of december 31, 2016). both the capital conservation buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer are being phased in over a transition period of four years that commenced on january 1, 2016. the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer is 0.625% in 2016 making the minimum capital requirement plus regulatory buffers for common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital ratios, 5.125%, 6.625% and 8.625%, respectively, for the company and the banks during 2016.
a common equity tier 1 capital ratio, tier 1 capital ratio, or total capital ratio below the applicable regulatory minimum ratio and the combined capital conservation buffer and the countercyclical buffer might restrict a bank's ability to distribute capital and make discretionary bonus payments. as of december 31, 2016, the company and each of the banks are all above the applicable combined thresholds.

additionally, banks designated as global systemically important banks ("g-sibs") are subject to an additional regulatory capital surcharge above the combined capital conservation and countercyclical capital buffers established by the basel iii capital rule. we are currently not designated as a g-sib and therefore not subject to this surcharge.
the following table compares our common equity tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as of december 31, 2016, subject to applicable transition provisions, to our estimated fully phased-in common equity tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets, as it applies for advanced approaches banks such as ourselves that have not yet exited parallel run. our estimated common equity tier 1 capital, risk-weighted assets and common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the fully phased-in basel iii standardized approach are non-gaap financial measures that we believe provide useful information in evaluating compliance with regulatory capital requirements that are not effective yet. they are calculated based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and is subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. as we continue to engage with our regulators, there could be further changes to the calculation.

__________
(1)   estimated common equity tier 1 capital, risk-weighted assets, and common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the fully phased-in basel iii standardized approach are non-gaap financial measures.
(2)   assumes adjustments are fully phased-in.
(3)   includes credit and market risk-weighted assets.
(4)   adjustments include higher risk weights for items that are included in capital based on the threshold deduction approach, such as mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets. the adjustments also include removal of risk weights for items that are deducted from common equity tier 1 capital.
(5)   calculated by dividing estimated common equity tier 1 capital by estimated risk-weighted assets, which are both calculated under the basel iii standardized approach, as it applies when fully phased-in for advanced approaches banks that have not yet exited parallel run.
under the basel iii capital rule, when we complete our parallel run for the advanced approaches, our minimum risk-based capital requirement will be determined by the greater of our risk-weighted assets under the basel iii standardized approach and the basel iii advanced approaches. see "part i-item 1. business-supervision and regulation" for additional information. once we exit parallel run, based on clarification of the basel iii capital rule from our regulators, any amount by which our expected credit losses exceed eligible credit reserves, as each term is defined under the basel iii capital rule, will be deducted from our basel iii standardized approach numerator, subject to transition provisions. inclusive of this impact, based on current capital rules and our business mix, we estimate that our basel iii advanced approaches ratios will be lower than our basel iii standardized approach ratios. however, there is uncertainty whether this will remain the case in light of potential changes to the united states capital rules.
capital planning and regulatory stress testing on april 5, 2016, we submitted our capital plan to the federal reserve as part of the 2016 ccar cycle. on june 29, 2016, the federal reserve informed us that they had "no objection" to our ccar 2016 capital plan submission. as a result of this non-objection to our capital plan, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of shares of our common stock from the third quarter of 2016 through the end of the second quarter of 2017, in addition to share repurchases related to employee compensation. the board of directors also authorized the quarterly dividend on our common stock of $0.40 per share. for the description of the regulatory capital planning rules we are subject to, see "part i-item 1. business-supervision and regulation."

non-cumulative the declaration and payment of dividends to our stockholders, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors. as a bhc, our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. regulatory restrictions exist that limit the ability of the banks
70      capital one financial corporation (cof)
to transfer funds to our bhc. as of december 31, 2016, funds available for dividend payments from cobna and cona were $3.9 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. there can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends to stockholders.
consistent with our 2016 stock repurchase program, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of shares of common stock beginning in the third quarter of 2016 through the end of the second quarter of 2017. through the end of 2016, we repurchased approximately $2.1 billion of shares of common stock as part of the 2016 stock repurchase program.
the timing and exact amount of any future common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including market conditions, opportunities for growth, our capital position and amount of retained earnings. our stock repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. for additional information on dividends and stock repurchases, see "part i-item 1. business-supervision and regulation-dividends, stock repurchases and transfer of funds."
risk management risk framework we use a risk framework to provide an overall enterprise-wide approach for effectively managing risk. we execute against our risk framework with the "three lines of defense" risk management model to demonstrate and structure the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities in the organization for taking and managing risk.
the "first line of defense" is comprised of the business areas that through their day-to-day business activities take risk on our behalf. as the business owner, the first line is responsible for identifying, assessing, managing and controlling that risk. this principle places ultimate accountability for the management of risks and ownership of risk decisions with the ceo and business heads. the "second line of defense" provides oversight of first line risk taking and management, and is primarily comprised of our risk management organization. the second line assists in determining risk appetite and the strategies, policies and structures for managing risks. the second line is both an "expert advisor" to the first line and an "effective challenger" of first line risk activities. the "third line of defense" is comprised of our internal audit and credit review functions. the third line provides independent and objective assurance to senior management and to the board of directors that first and second line risk management and internal control systems and its governance processes are well-designed and working as intended.
the risk framework is also used to guide design of risk programs and performance of risk activity within each risk category and across the entire enterprise.
our risk framework, which is built around governance, processes and people, consists of the following eight key elements:
establish governance processes, accountabilities and risk appetites the starting point of our risk framework is the establishment of governance processes, accountabilities and risk appetites. our board of directors and senior management establish the tone at the top regarding the importance of internal control, including standards of conduct and the integrity and ethical values of the company. management reinforces expectations at the various levels of the organization. this portion of the framework sets the foundation for the methods for governing risk taking, the interactions within and among the lines of defense, and the risk appetites and tolerance limits for risk taking.
identify and assess risks and ownership identifying and assessing risks and ownership is the beginning of the more detailed day-to-day process of managing risk. this portion of the framework clarifies the importance of strong first-line management and accountability for identifying and assessing risk while specifying the role of the second line to identify and assess risk, particularly when taking on new initiatives.
develop and operate controls, monitoring and mitigation plans we develop, operate and monitor controls to manage risk within tolerance levels. the first line develops controls to oversee and manage identified risks. controls may prevent risks from occurring or measure the amount of risk being taken so that the amount may be proactively managed. whenever possible, plans are implemented to mitigate risks or reduce them to lower levels. the first line leads mitigation, control and monitoring actions. the second line is a consultant on control design when needed.
71      capital one financial corporation (cof)
test and detect control gaps and perform corrective action while the first line is principally accountable for taking, controlling and monitoring risk, the second line oversees and monitors first line risk taking, including the effectiveness of first line controls, and the third line independently tests and oversees first and second line risk taking. these activities provide the second and third lines of defense with the ability to reduce the likelihood of unauthorized or unplanned risk taking within the organization. control gaps are closed by first line corrective action.
escalate key risks and gaps to executive management and when appropriate, the board of directors escalation is an important component of our risk framework. use of escalation is encouraged and does not necessarily indicate a failure on the part of first, second, or third line risk management. through escalation in the first line, decisions requiring judgment can be raised to executives who have the broadest possible context and experience to make challenging decisions. escalation in the second and third lines of defense can also demonstrate part of their core responsibilities of effective challenge. if appropriate, risks are escalated to the board of directors to ensure alignment with the most material risk decisions and/or transparency to the largest risks facing the organization.
calculate and allocate capital in alignment with risk management and measurement processes (including stress testing)
capital ultimately is held to protect the company from unforeseen risks or unexpected risk severity. as such, it is important that capital planning processes be well linked with risk management practices to ensure the appropriate capital protections are in place for the safety and soundness of the company. stress testing and economic capital measurement, both of which incorporate inputs from across the risk spectrum, are key tools for evaluating our capital position and risk adjusted returns.
support with the right culture, talent and skills the right culture, talent and skills are critical to effective risk management. our risk framework is supported with the right culture that promotes the foundation and values of the risk management organization. skills necessary to effectively manage risk are reinforced through performance management systems. when needed, risk talent is augmented through recruitment of industry experts as well as training and development of internal associates.
enabled by the right data, infrastructure and programs data, infrastructure and programs are key enablers of our risk management processes and practices. these core requirements enable effective risk modeling, efficient first, second and third line risk activity performance, and cross-line interaction. in addition, effective program design of each risk category is regularly assessed to ensure risk practices continue to evolve with leading industry practices, and continue to interact across categories as desired for a strong overall risk management program.
risk appetite risk appetite defines the parameters for taking and accepting risks and are used by management and our board of directors to make business decisions. risk appetite refers to the level of risk our business is willing to take in pursuit of our corporate business objectives. the board of directors approves our risk appetite including risk appetite statements and associated metrics, board notification thresholds, and board limits for each of our eight risk categories. we communicate risk appetite statements, limits and thresholds to the appropriate levels in the organization and monitor adherence. while first line executives manage risk on a day-to-day basis, the chief risk officer provides effective challenge and independent oversight to ensure that risks are within the appetite and specific limits established by the board of directors. the chief risk officer reports to the board of directors regularly on the nature and level of risk across all eight risk categories. in addition to his broader management responsibilities, our chief executive officer is responsible for developing the strategy and mission of our organization, determining and leading our culture, and reviewing and providing input into our risk appetite.
risk categories we apply our risk framework to protect our company from the eight major categories of risk that we are exposed to through our business activities. our eight major categories of risk are:
•   compliance risk: compliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations. compliance risk can also arise from nonconformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures, contractual obligations, or ethical standards that reinforce those laws, rules, or regulations;
72      capital one financial corporation (cof)
•   credit risk: credit risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from an obligor's failure to meet the terms of any contract with the company or otherwise perform as agreed;
•   legal risk: legal risk is the risk of material adverse impact due to: new and changed laws and regulations; interpretations of law; drafting, interpretation and enforceability of contracts; adverse decisions/consequences arising from litigation or regulatory action; the establishment, management and governance of our legal entity structure; and the failure to seek/follow appropriate legal counsel when needed;
•   liquidity risk: liquidity risk is the risk that the company will not be able to meet its future financial obligations as they come due, or invest in future asset growth because of an inability to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable time period;
•   market risk: market risk is the risk that an institution's earnings or the economic value of equity could be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or other market factors;
•   operational risk: operational risk is the risk of loss, capital impairment, adverse customer experience, or reputational impact resulting from failure to comply with policies and procedures, failed internal processes or systems, or from external events;
•   reputation risk: reputation risk is the risk to market value, recruitment and retention of talented associates and maintenance of a loyal customer base due to the negative perceptions of our internal and external constituents regarding our business strategies and activities; and
•   strategic risk: strategic risk is the risk of a material impact on current or anticipated earnings, capital, franchise or enterprise value arising from: (i) the company's competitive and market position and evolving forces in the industry that can affect that position; (ii) lack of responsiveness to these conditions; (iii) strategic decisions to change the company's scale, market position or operating model; or (iv) failure to appropriately consider implementation risks inherent in the company's strategy.
below we provide an overview of how we manage our eight primary risk categories.
compliance risk management we recognize that compliance requirements for financial institutions are increasingly complex and that there are heightened expectations from our regulators and our customers. in response, we continuously evaluate the regulatory environment and proactively adjust our compliance risk program to fully address these expectations.
our compliance management program establishes expectations for determining compliance requirements, assessing the risk of new product offerings, creating appropriate controls and training to address requirements, monitoring for control performance, and independently testing for adherence to compliance requirements. the program also establishes regular compliance reporting to senior business leaders, the executive committee and the board of directors.
the chief compliance officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing our compliance risk management program. business areas incorporate compliance requirements and controls into their business policies, standards, processes and procedures. they regularly monitor and report on the efficacy of their compliance controls and corporate compliance periodically independently tests to validate the effectiveness of business controls.
credit risk management we recognize that we are exposed to cyclical changes in credit quality. consequently, we try to ensure our credit portfolio is resilient to economic downturns. our most important tool in this endeavor is sound underwriting. in unsecured consumer loan underwriting, we generally assume that loans will be subject to an environment in which losses are higher than those prevailing at the time of underwriting. in commercial underwriting, we generally require strong cash flow, collateral and covenants and guarantees. in addition to sound underwriting, we continually monitor our portfolio and take steps to collect or work out distressed loans.
the chief risk officer, in conjunction with the consumer and commercial chief credit officers, is responsible for establishing credit risk policies and procedures, including underwriting and hold guidelines and credit approval authority, and monitoring credit exposure and performance of our lending-related transactions. these responsibilities are fulfilled by the chief consumer credit officer and the chief commercial credit officer who are responsible for evaluating the risk implications of credit strategy and for oversight of credit for both the existing portfolio and any new credit investments. the chief consumer credit officer and the
73      capital one financial corporation (cof)
chief commercial credit officer have formal approval authority for various types and levels of credit decisions, including individual commercial loan transactions. division presidents within each segment are responsible for managing the credit risk within their divisions and maintaining processes to control credit risk and comply with credit policies and guidelines. in addition, the chief risk officer establishes policies, delegates approval authority and monitors performance for non-loan credit exposure entered into with financial counterparties or through the purchase of credit sensitive securities in our investment portfolio.
our credit policies establish standards in five areas: customer selection, underwriting, monitoring, remediation and portfolio management. the standards in each area provide a framework comprising specific objectives and control processes. these standards are supported by detailed policies and procedures for each component of the credit process. starting with customer selection, our goal is to generally provide credit on terms that generate above hurdle returns. we use a number of quantitative and qualitative factors to manage credit risk, including setting credit risk limits and guidelines for each of our lines of business. we monitor performance relative to these guidelines and report results and any required mitigating actions to appropriate senior management committees and our board of directors.
legal risk management the general counsel provides legal evaluation and guidance to the enterprise and business areas and partners with other risk management functions such as compliance and internal audit. this evaluation and guidance is based on an assessment of the type and degree of legal risk associated with the internal business area practices and activities and of the controls the business has in place to mitigate legal risks.
liquidity risk management the head of finance and corporate development and the chief risk officer, in conjunction with the chief market and liquidity risk officer, are responsible for the establishment of liquidity risk management policies and standards for governance and monitoring of liquidity risk at a corporate level. we assess liquidity strength by evaluating several different balance sheet metrics under severe stress scenarios to ensure we can withstand significant funding degradation through idiosyncratic, systematic, and combined liquidity stress scenarios. we continuously monitor market and economic conditions to evaluate emerging stress conditions and appropriate action plans in accordance with our contingency funding plan. management reports liquidity metrics to appropriate senior management committees and our board of directors no less than quarterly.
we seek to mitigate liquidity risk strategically and tactically. from a strategic perspective, we have acquired and built deposit gathering businesses and significantly reduced our loan to deposit ratio. from a tactical perspective, we have accumulated a sizable liquidity reserve comprised of cash, high-quality, unencumbered securities and committed collateralized credit lines. we also continue to maintain access to secured and unsecured markets through ongoing issuance. this combination of stable and diversified funding sources and our stockpile of liquidity reserves enables us to maintain confidence in our liquidity position.
market risk management the head of finance and corporate development and the chief risk officer, in conjunction with the chief market and liquidity risk officer, are responsible for the establishment of market risk management policies and standards for the governance and monitoring of market risk at a corporate level. market risk is inherent from the financial instruments associated with our business operations and activities including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and derivatives. we manage market risk exposure, which is principally driven by balance sheet interest rate risk, centrally and establish quantitative risk limits to monitor and control our exposure.
we recognize that interest rate and foreign exchange risk is inherent in the banking business due to the nature of the assets and liabilities of banks. banks typically manage the trade-off between near-term earnings volatility and market value volatility by targeting moderate levels of each. in addition to using industry accepted techniques to analyze and measure interest rate and foreign exchange risk, we perform sensitivity analysis to identify our risk exposures under a broad range of scenarios. investment securities and derivatives are the main levers for the management of interest rate and foreign exchange risk.
the market risk positions for the company and each of the banks are calculated separately and in aggregate, and analyzed against pre-established limits. results are reported to the asset liability committee monthly and to the risk committee of the board of directors no less than quarterly. management is authorized to utilize financial instruments as outlined in our policy to actively manage market risk exposure.
74      capital one financial corporation (cof)
operational risk management we recognize the criticality of managing operational risk on both a strategic and day-to-day basis and that there are heightened expectations from our regulators and our customers. we have implemented appropriate operational risk management policies, standards, processes and controls to enable the delivery of high quality and consistent customer experiences and to achieve business objectives in a controlled manner.
the chief operational risk officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing our operational risk management program. in accordance with basel iii advanced approaches requirements, the program establishes practices for assessing the operational risk profile and executing key control processes for operational risks. corporate operational risk management enforces these practices and delivers reporting of operational risk results to senior business leaders, the executive committee and the board of directors.
reputation risk management we recognize that reputation risk is of particular concern for financial institutions in the current environment marked by increased scrutiny and widespread regulatory changes. we manage both strategic and tactical reputation issues and build our relationships with government officials, media, community and consumer advocates, and other constituencies to help strengthen the reputations of both our company and industry. our actions include implementing pro-customer practices in our business and serving low to moderate income communities in our market area consistent with a quality bank. the general counsel is responsible for managing our overall reputation risk program. day-to-day activities are controlled by the frameworks set forth in our reputation risk management policy and other risk management policies.
strategic risk management we monitor external market and industry developments to identify potential areas of strategic opportunity or risk. these items provide input for development of the company's strategy led by the chief executive officer and other senior executives. through the ongoing development and vetting of the corporate strategy, the chief risk officer identifies and assesses risks associated with the strategy across all risk categories and monitors them throughout the year.

credit risk profile our loan portfolio accounts for the substantial majority of our credit risk exposure. our lending activities are governed under our credit policy and are subject to independent review and approval. below we provide information about the composition of our loan portfolio, key concentrations and credit performance metrics.
we also engage in certain non-lending activities that may give rise to credit and counterparty settlement risk, including the purchase of securities for our investment securities portfolio, entering into derivative transactions to manage our market risk exposure and to accommodate customers, short-term advances on syndication activity (including bridge financing transactions we have underwritten), certain operational cash balances in other financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and customer overdrafts. we provide additional information on credit risk related to our investment securities portfolio under "md&a-consolidated balance sheets analysis-investment securities" and credit risk related to derivative transactions in "note 10-derivative instruments and hedging activities."
primary loan products we provide a variety of lending products. our primary loan products include credit cards, auto, home loans and commercial.
•   credit cards: we originate both prime and subprime credit cards through a variety of channels. our credit cards generally have variable interest rates. credit card accounts are primarily underwritten using an automated underwriting system based on predictive models that we have developed. the underwriting criteria, which are customized for individual products and marketing programs, are established based on an analysis of the net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, subject to further analysis using a variety of stress conditions. underwriting decisions are generally based on credit bureau information, including payment history, debt burden and credit scores, such as fico, and on other factors, such as applicant income. we maintain a credit card securitization program and selectively sell charged-off credit card loans.
•   auto: we originate both prime and subprime auto loans. customers are acquired through a network of auto dealers and direct marketing. our auto loans generally have fixed interest rates and loan terms of 75 months or less and can go up to 84 months. loan size limits are customized by program and are generally less than $75,000. similar to credit card accounts, the underwriting criteria are customized for individual products and marketing programs and based on analysis of net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, subject to maintaining resilience under a variety of stress conditions. underwriting decisions are generally based on an applicant's income, estimated debt-to-income ratio, and credit bureau information, along with collateral characteristics such as loan-to-value ("ltv") ratio. we generally retain all of our auto loans, though we have securitized and sold auto loans in the past and may do so in the future.
•   home loans: most of the existing home loans in our loan portfolio were originated by banks we acquired. currently, we originate residential mortgage and home equity loans through our branches, direct marketing, and dedicated home loan officers. our home loan products include conforming and non-conforming fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans, as well as first and second lien home equity loans and lines of credit. in general, our underwriting policy limits for these loans include:
◦   a maximum ltv ratio of 80% for loans without mortgage insurance;
◦   a maximum ltv ratio of 95% for loans with mortgage insurance or for home equity products;
◦   a maximum debt-to-income ratio of 50%; and
◦   a maximum loan amount of $3 million.
our underwriting procedures are intended to verify the income of applicants and obtain appraisals to determine home values. we may, in limited instances, use automated valuation models to determine home values. our underwriting standards for conforming loans are designed to meet the underwriting standards required by the agencies at a minimum, and we sell most of our conforming loans to the agencies. we generally retain non-conforming mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit.
•   commercial: we offer a range of commercial lending products, including loans secured by commercial real estate and loans to middle market commercial and industrial companies. our commercial loans may have a fixed or variable interest rate; however, the majority of our commercial loans have variable rates. our underwriting standards require an analysis of the
76      capital one financial corporation (cof)
borrower's financial condition and prospects, as well as an assessment of the industry in which the borrower operates. where relevant, we evaluate and appraise underlying collateral and guarantees. we maintain underwriting guidelines and limits for major types of borrowers and loan products that specify, where applicable, guidelines for debt service coverage, leverage, ltv ratio and standard covenants and conditions. we assign a risk rating and establish a monitoring schedule for loans based on the risk profile of the borrower, industry segment, source of repayment, the underlying collateral and guarantees (if any) and current market conditions. although we generally retain commercial loans, we may syndicate positions for risk mitigation purposes (including bridge financing transactions we have underwritten). in addition, we originate and service multifamily commercial real estate loans which are sold to the government-sponsored enterprises.
loans held for investment portfolio composition our loan portfolio consists of loans held for investment, including loans held in our consolidated trusts, and loans held for sale. table 16 presents the composition of our portfolio of loans held for investment, including pci loans, by portfolio segment as of december 31, 2016 and 2015. table 16 and the credit metrics presented in this section exclude loans held for sale, which are carried at lower of cost or fair value and totaled $1.0 billion and $904 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

(1)   industry categories are based on our interpretation of the north american industry classification system codes as they pertain to each individual loan.
(2)   in addition to loans outstanding, we also have unfunded lending commitments of approximately $2.9 billion and $3.4 billion to oil and gas companies as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. for information on our total unfunded lending commitments to extend credit see "note 19-commitments, contingencies, guarantees and others."
(3)   includes our taxi medallion lending portfolio among other portfolios.
purchased credit-impaired loans our portfolio of loans includes certain of our consumer and commercial loans acquired in business acquisitions that were recorded at fair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for using the guidance for accounting for pci loans and debt securities, which is based upon expected cash flows. these pci loans totaled $15.1 billion as of december 31, 2016 compared to $19.5 billion as of december 31, 2015. see "md&a-glossary and acronyms" for the definition of "pci loans."
the difference between the fair value at acquisition and expected cash flows represents the accretable yield, which is recognized in interest income over the life of the loans. the difference between the contractual payments on the loans and expected cash flows represents the nonaccretable difference or the amount of principal and interest not considered collectible, which incorporates future expected credit losses over the life of the loans. we regularly update our estimate of expected principal and interest to be collected from these loans and evaluate the results for each accounting pool that was established at acquisition based on loans with common risk characteristics. probable decreases in expected cash flows would trigger the recognition of an allowance for loan and lease losses through our provision for credit losses. probable and significant increases in expected cash flows would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan and lease losses established subsequent to acquisition, with any remaining increase in expected cash flows recognized prospectively in interest income over the remaining estimated life of the underlying loans. see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" for additional information on pci loans that are accounted for based on expected cash flows.

home loans the majority of our home loan portfolio are pci loans acquired from the ing direct and ccb acquisitions, representing 67% and 73% of our total home loan portfolio as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. see "md&a-glossary and acronyms" for the definition of ing direct and ccb acquisitions. the expected cash flows for the pci loans in our home loan portfolio are significantly impacted by future expectations of home prices and interest rates. decreases in expected cash flows that result from declining conditions, particularly associated with these variables, could result in an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses and reduction in accretable yield. charge-offs on these loans are not recorded until the expected credit losses within the nonaccretable difference are depleted. in addition, pci loans are not classified as delinquent or nonperforming as we expect to collect our net investment in these loans and the nonaccretable difference is expected to absorb the majority of the losses associated with these loans.

__________
(1)   due to the revolving nature of credit card loans, we report the majority of our variable-rate credit card loans as due in one year or less. we report fixed-rate credit card loans with introductory rates that expire after a certain period of time as due in one year or less. we assume that the rest of our remaining fixed-rate credit card loans will mature within one to three years.
(2)   we report the maturity period for the home loans portfolio included in the consumer banking business based on the earlier of the next re-pricing or contractual maturity date of the loan.
credit risk measurement we closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk. key metrics we track in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming asset rates, as well as net charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger balance commercial loans. trends in delinquency rates are a primary indicator of credit risk within our consumer loan portfolios, as changes in delinquency rates provide an early warning of changes in credit losses. the primary indicator of credit risk in our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings. because we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming, the level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. in addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of our loans provides insight as to the exposure of the portfolio to regional economic conditions.
we underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models, which are typically based on credit bureau data, including borrower credit scores, along with application information and, where applicable, collateral and deal structure data. we continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. we also use borrower credit scores for subprime classification, for competitive benchmarking and, in some cases, to drive product segmentation decisions.

(1)   credit scores generally represent fico scores. these scores are obtained from one of the major credit bureaus at origination and are refreshed monthly thereafter. we approximate non-fico credit scores to comparable fico scores for consistency purposes. balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 660 or below category.
(2)   credit scores generally represent average fico scores obtained from three credit bureaus at the time of application and are not refreshed thereafter. balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 620 or below category.
we present information in the section below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio.
see "note 4-loans" in this report for additional credit quality information. also, see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" for information on our accounting policies for delinquent and nonperforming loans, net charge-offs and tdrs for each of our loan categories.
delinquency rates we consider the entire balance of an account to be delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the customer's due date, measured at the reporting date. our 30+ day delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due, whereas our 30+ day performing delinquency metrics include loans that are 30 or more days past due but are currently classified as performing and accruing interest. the 30+ day delinquency and 30+ day performing delinquency metrics are the same for domestic credit card loans, as we continue to classify loans as performing until the account is charged off, typically when the account is 180 days past due. see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories. we provide additional information on our credit quality metrics above under "md&a-business segment financial performance."

table 24 summarizes loans that were 90+ days delinquent as to interest or principal, and still accruing interest as of december 31, 2016 and 2015. these loans consist primarily of credit card accounts between 90 days and 179 days past due. as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the ffiec, we continue to accrue interest and fees on domestic credit card loans through the date of charge-off, which is typically in the period the account becomes 180 days past due. while domestic credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until the loan is charged off, we reduce the balance of our credit card receivables by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue.

(1)   we recognized interest income for loans classified as nonperforming of $45 million and $44 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. interest income foregone related to nonperforming loans was $59 million and $53 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. foregone interest income represents the amount of interest income that would have been recorded during the period for nonperforming loans as of the end of the period had the loans performed according to their contractual terms.
(2)   excluding the impact of pci loans, the nonperforming loan rates for our home loan and total consumer banking portfolios were 3.81% and 0.90%, respectively, as of december 31, 2016, compared to 4.68% and 1.08%, respectively, as of december 31, 2015.
(3)   excluding the impact of domestic credit card loans, nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment was 1.08% and 0.83% as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
(4)   the denominator used in calculating the nonperforming asset ratios consists of total loans held for investment and total other nonperforming assets.
(5) includes the net realizable value of auto loans that have been charged off as a result of a bankruptcy and repossessed assets obtained in satisfaction of auto loans.

net charge-offs net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine to be uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. we charge off loans as a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses when we determine the loan is uncollectible and record subsequent recoveries of previously charged off amounts as increases to the allowance for loan and lease losses. we exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and certain fraud losses from charge-offs. generally, costs to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expenses and included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense as incurred. our charge-off policy for loans varies based on the loan type. see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" for information on our charge-off policy for each of our loan categories.

troubled debt restructurings as part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide short-term (three to twelve months) or long-term (greater than twelve months) modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectability of the loan and to avoid the need for foreclosure or repossession of collateral.

in the credit card business, the majority of our credit card loans modified in tdrs involve reducing the interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. the effective interest rate in effect immediately prior to the loan modification is used as the effective interest rate for purposes of measuring impairment using the present value of expected cash flows. in some cases, the interest rate on a credit card account automatically increases due to non-payment, late payment or similar events. in all cases, we cancel the customer's available line of credit on the credit card. if the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms, likely resulting in any loan outstanding reflected in the appropriate delinquency category, and charged off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy.
in the consumer banking business, the majority of our loans modified in tdrs receive an extension, an interest rate reduction or principal reduction, or a combination of both. in addition, tdrs also occur in connection with bankruptcy of the borrower. in certain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is written down to the collateral value and the charged off amount is reported as principal reduction. their impairment is determined using the present value of expected cash flows or a collateral evaluation for certain auto and home loans where the collateral value is lower than the recorded investment.
in the commercial banking business, the majority of loans modified in tdrs receive an extension, with a portion of these loans receiving an interest rate reduction. the impairment on modified commercial loans is generally determined based on the underlying collateral value. we provide additional information on modified loans accounted for as tdrs, including the performance of those loans subsequent to modification, in "note 4-loans."
impaired loans a loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan. generally, we report loans as impaired based on the method for measuring impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. loans defined as individually impaired include larger balance commercial nonperforming loans and tdrs. loans held for sale are not reported as impaired, as these loans are recorded at lower of cost or fair value. impaired loans also exclude pci loans accounted for based on expected cash flows because this accounting methodology takes into consideration future credit losses expected to be incurred.

impaired loans, including tdrs, totaled $3.2 billion and $2.5 billion as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. modified tdr loans accounted for $2.5 billion and $1.8 billion of impaired loans as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we provide additional information on our impaired loans, including the allowance for loan and lease losses established for these loans, in "note 4-loans" and "note 5-allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments."
allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments our allowance for loan and lease losses represents management's best estimate of incurred loan and lease credit losses inherent to our held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date. the allowance for loan and lease losses is increased through the provision for credit losses and reduced by net charge-offs. we provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses under "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies."
our allowance for loan and lease losses increased by $1.4 billion to $6.5 billion as of december 31, 2016 from december 31, 2015, and the allowance coverage ratio increased by 42 basis points to 2.65% as of december 31, 2016 from december 31, 2015. the increases were primarily driven by:
•   continued growth and seasoning in our credit card loan portfolio;
•   continued growth in our auto loan portfolio, increasing loss expectations on recent originations and a build reflecting a change in accounting estimate of the timing of charge-offs of bankrupt accounts; and
•   continued adverse industry conditions impacting our taxi medallion and oil and gas lending portfolios in our commercial banking business.
table 28 presents changes in our allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments for 2016 and 2015, and details by portfolio segment for the provision for credit losses, charge-offs and recoveries recognized in our consolidated statements of income.

liquidity risk profile we have established liquidity practices that are intended to ensure that we have sufficient asset-based liquidity to withstand the potential impact of deposit attrition or diminished liquidity in the funding markets. our practices are intended to maintain adequate liquidity reserves to cover our funding requirements as well as any potential deposit run-off and maintain access to diversified funding sources to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. our liquidity reserves consist of readily-marketable or pledgable assets which can be used as a source of liquidity, if needed.

__________
(1)   the weighted-average life of our securities was approximately 6.0 years and 5.8 years as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
(2)   as part of our liquidity management strategy, we pledge securities to secure borrowings from counterparties and to secure trust and public deposits and other purposes as required or permitted by law. we pledged securities available for sale with a fair value of $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we also pledged securities held to maturity with a carrying value of $8.1 billion and $8.7 billion as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
our liquidity reserves increased by $2.1 billion to $74.1 billion as of december 31, 2016 from december 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in our investment securities portfolio. see "md&a-risk management" for additional information on our management of liquidity risk.
we are subject to the final lcr rule issued by the federal banking agencies. the final lcr rule came into effect in january 2015 and required us to calculate the lcr as of the last business day of each month from january 2015 until june 2016, and requires us to calculate the lcr on a daily basis as of july 1, 2016. the minimum lcr standard is phased-in at 80% by january 1, 2015, 90% by january 1, 2016 and 100% by january 1, 2017 and thereafter. at december 31, 2016, we exceeded the fully phased-in lcr requirement. the calculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on

changes to future regulations and interpretations. see "part i-item 1. business-supervision and regulation" for additional information.
borrowing capacity we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec on march 31, 2015, which expires in march 2018. under this shelf registration, we may periodically offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. there is no limit under this shelf registration to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell, subject to market conditions. we also filed a new shelf registration statement with the sec on january 12, 2016, which expires in january 2019 and allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $23 billion of securitized debt obligations from our credit card loan securitization trust.
in addition to our issuance capacity under the shelf registration statements, we also have access to fhlb advances with a maximum borrowing capacity of $24.9 billion as of december 31, 2016, of which $7.3 billion was still available to us to borrow as of december 31, 2016. we pledged loan collateral with an outstanding balance of $29.3 billion to secure this borrowing capacity. the ability to draw down funding is based on membership status and the amount is dependent upon the banks' ability to post collateral. our fhlb membership is secured by our investment in fhlb stock of $760 million and $884 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which was determined in part based on our outstanding advances. we also have access to the federal reserve discount window through which we had a borrowing capacity of $7.9 billion as of december 31, 2016. although available, we do not view this borrowing capacity as a primary source of liquidity and did not utilize it during 2016 or 2015.
funding the company's primary source of funding comes from deposits, which provide us with a stable and relatively low cost of funds. in addition to deposits, the company raises funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, fhlb advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios, the issuance of securitized debt obligations, the issuance of brokered deposits, federal funds purchased and other borrowings. a key objective in our use of these markets is to maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources.

our deposits include brokered deposits, which we obtained through the use of third-party intermediaries. those brokered deposits are reported as interest-bearing checking, saving deposits and time deposits in the above table and totaled $22.5 billion and $12.0 billion as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
the fdic limits the acceptance of brokered deposits by well-capitalized insured depository institutions and, with a waiver from the fdic, by adequately-capitalized institutions. cobna and cona were well-capitalized, as defined under the federal banking regulatory guidelines, as of both december 31, 2016 and 2015. see "part i-item 1. business-supervision and regulation" for additional information.

short-term borrowings and long-term debt we access the capital markets to meet our funding needs through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations, and federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. in addition, we may utilize short-term and long-term fhlb advances secured by our investment securities, residential home loans, multifamily real estate loans, commercial real estate loans and home equity lines of credit. substantially all of our long-term fhlb advances are structured with either a one-month or a three-month call option at our discretion.
our short-term borrowings include those borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less and do not include the current portion of long-term debt. the short-term borrowings, which consist of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, and short-term fhlb advances, increased by $11 million to $992 million as of december 31, 2016 from december 31, 2015.
our long-term debt, which primarily consists of securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, and long-term fhlb advances, increased by $1.3 billion to $59.5 billion as of december 31, 2016 from december 31, 2015, as issuances outpaced maturities.

credit ratings our credit ratings impact our ability to access capital markets and our borrowing costs. rating agencies base their ratings on numerous factors, including liquidity, capital adequacy, asset quality, quality of earnings and the probability of systemic support. significant changes in these factors could result in different ratings. such ratings help to support our cost effective unsecured funding as part of our overall financing programs.

market risk profile market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities, including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and derivatives. below we provide additional information about our primary sources of market risk, our market risk management strategies and the measures we use to evaluate our market risk exposure.
primary market risk exposures our primary source of market risk is interest rate risk. we also have exposure to foreign exchange risk and customer-related trading risk, both of which we believe are minimal after considering the impact of our associated risk management activities discussed below.
interest rate risk interest rate risk, which represents exposure to instruments whose yield or price varies with the volatility of interest rates, is our most significant source of market risk exposure. banks are inevitably exposed to interest rate risk due to differences in the timing between the maturities or re-pricing of assets and liabilities.
foreign exchange risk foreign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. our primary exposure to foreign exchange risk is related to the operations of our international businesses in the u.k. and canada. the largest foreign exchange exposure arising from these operations is the funding they are provided in the great british pound ("gbp") and the canadian dollar ("cad"), respectively. we also have foreign exchange exposure through our net equity investments in these operations and through the dollar-denominated value of future earnings and cash flows they generate.
our intercompany funding exposes our consolidated statements of income to foreign exchange transaction risk, while our equity investments in our foreign operations result in translation risk in aoci and our capital ratios. we manage our transaction risk by entering into forward foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to foreign currency-denominated intercompany borrowings. we use foreign currency derivative contracts as net investment hedges to manage our aoci exposure. as of december 31, 2016, we apply hedge accounting to both our intercompany funding hedges and our net investment hedges, with the primary net investments subject to hedging those denominated in gbp.
the intercompany borrowings to our international businesses were 786 million gbp and 893 million gbp as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 6.2 billion cad and 5.9 billion cad as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we hedge all the cash flows associated with these borrowings with forward foreign currency derivative contracts.
in regard to our non-dollar-denominated equity, we measure our total exposure by regularly tracking the value of net equity invested in our foreign operations, the largest of which is in our u.k. and canadian operations. our measurement of net equity includes the impact of net investment hedges where applicable. we apply a 30% u.s. dollar appreciation shock against these net investment exposures, which we believe approximates a significant adverse foreign exchange movement over a one-year time horizon. our gross equity exposures in our u.k. and canadian operations were 1.5 billion gbp and 1.4 billion gbp as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 863 million cad and 686 million cad as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
as a result of our derivative management activities, we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal.
customer-related trading risk we offer various interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity derivatives as an accommodation to our customers within our commercial banking business and offset the majority of these exposures through derivative transactions with other counterparties. these exposures are measured and monitored on a daily basis. as a result of offsetting our customer exposures with other counterparties, we believe our net exposure to customer-related trading risk is minimal.
93      capital one financial corporation (cof)
we employ value-at-risk ("var") as the primary method to both measure and monitor the market risk in our customer-related trading activities. var is a statistical-based risk measure used to estimate the potential loss from adverse market movements in a normal market environment. we employ a historical simulation approach using the most recent 500 business days and use a 99 percent confidence level and a holding period of 1 business day. we use internal models to produce a daily var measure of the market risk of all customer-related trading exposures.
for further information on our customer-related trading exposures, see "note 10-derivative instruments and hedging activities."
market risk management we employ several techniques to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk, which include, but are not limited to, altering the duration and re-pricing characteristics of our various assets and liabilities through interest rate derivatives and mitigating the foreign exchange exposure of certain non-dollar-denominated equity or transactions through derivatives. our current market risk management policies include the use of derivatives, which are one of the primary tools we use in managing interest rate and foreign exchange risk. we execute our derivative contracts in both over-the-counter ("otc") and exchange-traded derivative markets and have exposure to both bilateral and clearinghouse counterparties. although the majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps, we also use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage both our interest rate and foreign currency risk. the outstanding notional amount of our derivative contracts increased to $142.9 billion as of december 31, 2016 from $105.9 billion as of december 31, 2015 primarily driven by an increase in our hedging activities.
market risk measurement we have risk management policies and limits established by our market risk management policies and approved by the board of directors. our objective is to manage our asset and liability risk position and exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and prescribed limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. because no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk, we use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analysis to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar-denominated earnings and non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations. we provide additional information below in "economic value of equity."
we consider the impact on both net interest income and economic value of equity in measuring and managing our interest rate risk. because the federal funds target range is currently 0.50% to 0.75%, we use a 50 basis points decrease as our declining interest rate scenario, since a scenario where interest rates would decline by 200 basis points is unlikely. in scenarios where a 50 basis points decline would result in a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0%. below we discuss the assumptions used in calculating each of these measures.
net interest income sensitivity this sensitivity measure estimates the impact on our projected 12-month base-line interest rate-sensitive revenue resulting from movements in interest rates. interest rate-sensitive revenue consists of net interest income and certain components of other non-interest income significantly impacted by movements in interest rates, including changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and free-standing interest rate swaps. adjusted net interest income consists of net interest income and changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, including related derivative hedging activity, and changes in the fair value of free-standing interest rate swaps. in addition to our existing assets and liabilities, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions, such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast. in measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our projected interest rate-sensitive revenue, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of +200 basis points, +100 basis points, +50 basis points and -50 basis points to spot rates, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above. at the current level of interest rates, we are asset sensitive in the +50 and +100 basis points scenarios and liability sensitive in the +200 basis points scenario. the switch to liability sensitivity in the +200 basis points scenario compared with the +100 basis points scenario is mainly driven by the assumption that deposit repricing increases with higher interest rates.
economic value of equity our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including derivative hedging activity, resulting from movements in interest rates. our economic value of equity sensitivity measures are calculated based on our existing assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and do not incorporate business growth assumptions
94      capital one financial corporation (cof)
or projected plans for funding mix changes. in measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of +200 basis points, +100 basis points, +50 basis points and -50 basis points to spot rates, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above.
calculating our economic value of equity and its sensitivity to interest rates requires projecting cash flows for assets, liabilities and derivative instruments and discounting those cash flows at the appropriate discount rates. key assumptions in our economic value of equity calculation include projecting rate sensitive prepayments for mortgage securities, loans and other assets, term structure modeling of interest rates, discount spreads, and deposit volume and pricing assumptions.
during the second quarter of 2016, we updated our projected deposit re-pricing assumptions as part of our regular evaluation and assessment of the assumptions and models used to measure our interest rate risk sensitivity. this update reduced our estimated asset sensitivity as shown in our projected base-line net interest income measure and had a minor impact to our economic value of equity measures.
our current economic value of equity sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity generally decreases as interest rates increase indicating that the economic value of our assets and derivative positions is more sensitive to interest rate changes than our liabilities.
table 35 shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected base-line net interest income and economic value of equity calculated under our revised methodology described above as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, as well as under our previous methodology as of december 31, 2015. our base-line net interest income sensitivity decreased as compared to december 31, 2015 as a result of higher market interest rates as well as the enhancements to our deposit re-pricing assumptions noted above. our economic value of equity sensitivity increased as compared to december 31, 2015 primarily due to higher market interest rates, updates to long-term cash flow estimates and discount spreads for certain credit card balances and the treatment of intangible assets in this calculation.

in addition to these industry standard measures, we will continue to factor into our internal interest rate risk management decisions the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios, such as stressed rate shocks as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios.
limitations of market risk measures the interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. we regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities.

there are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. the sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet and, in some cases, expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions. the strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections, which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis.

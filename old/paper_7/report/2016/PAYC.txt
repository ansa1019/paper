item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements (prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("u.s. gaap")) and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k (this "form 10-k"). the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. see part i "special note regarding forward-looking statements" for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks, and assumptions associated with those statements. actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward- looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10-k, particularly in the section entitled "risk factors." unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, the terms "we," "us," "our" and the "company" refer to paycom software, inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
overview we are a leading provider of comprehensive, cloud-based human capital management ("hcm") software delivered as software-as-a-service.  we provide functionality and data analytics that businesses need to manage the complete employment life cycle from recruitment to retirement.  our solution requires virtually no customization and is based on a core system of record maintained in a single database for all hcm functions, including talent acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management and human resources ("hr") management applications.  our user-friendly software allows for easy adoption of our solution by employees, enabling self-management of their hcm activities in the cloud, which reduces the administrative burden on employers and increases employee productivity.
we serve a diverse client base in terms of size and industry. we have over 17,800 clients, none of which constituted more than one-half of one percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016. we stored data for more than 2.7 million persons employed by our clients during the year ended december 31, 2016.
our revenues are primarily generated through our sales force that solicits new clients and our client relations representatives who sell additional applications to existing clients.  we have 42 sales teams located in 24 states and plan to open additional sales offices to further expand our presence in the u.s. market.  during the year ended december 31, 2016, we opened six new sales offices, with one new sales office located in each of chicago, cleveland, pasadena, sacramento, san antonio and stamford.  our continued growth depends on attracting new clients through further penetration of our existing markets, geographic expansion and the introduction of new applications to our existing client base.  we also expect that changes in certain factors affecting our performance will correlate with improvement or deterioration in the labor market. our principal marketing programs include email campaigns, social and digital media, search engine marketing methods and tradeshows.
during the last three years, we have developed several new applications. we believe our ability to continue to develop new applications and to improve existing applications will enable us to increase revenues in the future, and the number of our new applications adopted by our clients has been a significant factor in our revenue growth over the last three years.
trends, opportunities and challenges our payroll application is the foundation of our solution and all of our clients are required to utilize this application in order to access our other applications.  as a result of our evolving revenue mix as clients add more non-payroll applications, coupled with the unique client benefits that our solution provides (e.g., enabling our clients to scale the number of hcm applications that they use on an as-needed basis), we are presented with a variety of opportunities and challenges.
we generate revenues from (i) fixed amounts charged per billing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed or (ii) fixed amounts charged per billing period.  we do not require clients to enter into long-term contractual commitments with us.  our billing period varies by client based on when they pay their employees, which is either weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly.
for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our gross margins were approximately 84%, 84% and 82%, respectively.  although our gross margins may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonality and hiring trends, we expect that our gross margins will remain relatively consistent in future periods.
growing our business has also resulted in, and will continue to result in, substantial investment in sales professionals, operating expenses, systems development and programming costs and general and administrative expenses, which has and will continue to increase our expenses. we intend to obtain new clients by (i) continuing to expand our presence in metropolitan areas where we currently have an existing sales office through adding sales teams or offices and increasing the number of our sales professionals and (ii) opening sales offices in new metropolitan areas. our ability to increase revenues and improve operating results depends on our ability to add new clients.
the average size of our clients has grown significantly as we have organically grown our operations and increased the number of applications we offer. based on our total revenues, we have grown at an approximately 44% cagr from january 1, 2012 through
29
december 31, 2016. because we charge our clients on a per employee basis for certain services we provide, any increase or decrease in the number of employees that our clients have will have a positive or negative impact, respectively, on our results of operations. our solution requires no adjustment to serve larger clients. we believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of potential clients and to increase our revenues per client, with limited incremental cost to us.
we believe the challenges of managing the ever-changing complexity of payroll and human resources will continue to drive companies to turn to outsourced providers for help with their hcm needs. the hcm industry historically has been driven, in part, by legislation and regulatory action, including cobra, changes to the minimum wage laws or overtime rules, and legislation from federal, state or municipal taxation authorities. the implementation of the affordable care act (the "aca") is the most recent example of legislation that has created demand in the hcm industry.  we generate aca-related revenues (i) on an annual basis in connection with processing and filing forms 1094 and 1095 on behalf of clients and (ii) from clients who have purchased our enhanced aca application as part of the fixed, bundled price charged per billing period.  while we generally do not track our revenues on an application-by-application basis (because applications are often sold in various groupings and configurations for a single price), we estimate that, if the aca is not modified or repealed, revenues from our enhanced aca application and aca forms filings business will represent approximately 5% of total projected revenues for the year ending december 31, 2017.
throughout our history, we have built strong relationships with our clients. as the hcm needs of our clients evolve, we believe that we are well-positioned to gain additional share of the hcm spending of our clients, and we believe this opportunity is significant. to be successful, we must continue to demonstrate the operational and economic benefits of our solution, as well as effectively hire, train, motivate and retain qualified personnel.
key metrics in addition to the u.s. gaap and non-gaap metrics discussed elsewhere in this form 10-k, we also monitor the following metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance and identify trends affecting our business:

key performance indicators:

•   clients. when we calculate the number of clients at period end, we treat client accounts with separate taxpayer identification numbers as separate clients, which often separates client accounts that are affiliated with the same parent organization. we track the number of our clients to provide an accurate gauge of the size of our business. unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to clients throughout this form 10-k refer to this metric.

•   clients (based on parent company grouping). when we calculate the number of clients based on parent company grouping at period end, we combine client accounts that have identified the same person(s) as their decision-maker regardless of whether the client accounts have separate taxpayer identification numbers, which often combines client accounts that are affiliated with the same parent organization. we track the number of our clients based on parent company grouping to provide an alternate measure of the size of our business and clients.

•   sales teams. we monitor our sales professionals by the number of sales teams at period end. each team consists of a sales manager and approximately six to eight sales professionals. certain larger metropolitan areas can support more than one sales team. we believe that the number of sales teams is an indicator of potential revenues for future periods.

•   annual revenue retention rate. our annual revenue retention rate tracks the percentage of revenues that we retain from our existing clients. we monitor this metric because it is an indicator of client satisfaction and revenues for future periods.

components of results of operations sources of revenues revenues are comprised of recurring revenues, and implementation and other revenues. we expect our revenues to increase as we introduce new applications, expand our client base and renew and expand relationships with existing clients. as a percentage of total revenues, we expect our mix of recurring revenues, and implementation and other revenues to remain relatively constant.

recurring. recurring revenues include fees for our talent acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management and hr management applications as well as fees charged for delivery of client payroll checks and reports. these revenues are derived from (i) fixed amounts charged per billing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed or (ii) fixed amounts charged per billing period. because recurring revenues are based, in part, on fees for use of our applications and the delivery of checks and reports that are levied on a per-employee basis, our recurring revenues increase as our clients hire more employees.  recurring revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered.  as of april 1, 2016, recurring revenues also include interest earned on funds held for clients.  we collect funds from clients in advance of either the applicable due date for payroll tax submissions or the applicable disbursement date for employee payment services. these collections from clients are typically disbursed from one to 30 days after receipt, with some funds being held for up to 120 days. we typically invest funds held for clients in money market funds, demand deposit accounts, commercial paper and certificates of deposit until they are paid to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees. we expect that interest earned on funds held for clients will increase as we introduce new applications, expand our client base and renew and expand relationships with existing clients.  the amount of interest we earn from the investment of client funds is also impacted by changes in interest rates.
implementation and other. implementation and other revenues are comprised of implementation fees for the deployment of our solution and other revenues from sales of time clocks as part of our time and attendance services. non-refundable implementation fees are charged to new clients at inception and upon the addition of certain incremental applications for existing clients. these fees range from 10% to 30% of the annualized value of the transaction.  implementation revenues are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the life of the client, which is estimated to be 10 years, and other revenues are recognized upon shipment of time clocks. implementation and other revenues comprised approximately 1.7% of our total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016.
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists of expenses related to hosting and supporting our applications, hardware costs, systems support and technology and depreciation and amortization. these costs include employee-related expenses (including non-cash stock-based compensation expenses) and other expenses related to client support, bank charges for processing ach transactions, certain implementation expenses, delivery charges and paper costs. they also include our cost for time clocks sold and ongoing technology and support costs related to our systems. the amount of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment allocated to cost of revenues is determined based upon an estimate of assets used to support our operations.
administrative expenses administrative expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, general and administrative and depreciation and amortization. sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for our direct sales and marketing staff (such as commissions and bonuses and non-cash stock-based compensation expenses), marketing expenses and other related costs. research and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses (including non-cash stock-based compensation expenses) for our development staff, net of capitalized software costs for internally developed software. we expect to grow our research and development efforts as we continue to broaden our payroll and hr solution offerings and extend our technological solutions by investing in the development of new applications and introducing them to new and existing clients. general and administrative expenses consist of employee-related expenses for finance and accounting, legal, human resources and management information systems personnel (including non-cash stock-based compensation expenses), legal costs, professional fees and other corporate expenses. depreciation and amortization expenses consist of (i) the amount of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment allocated to administrative expenses (based upon an estimate of assets used to support our selling, general and administrative functions) and (ii) amortization of intangible assets.
net loss on early repayment of debt during 2014, we wrote off $4.1 million related to the discount associated with the repayment of certain related party debt.
interest expense interest expense includes interest on debt related to our corporate headquarters and, with respect to the year ended december 31, 2014 only, related party debt.
other income, net other income, net includes interest earned on our own funds and any gain or loss on the sale or disposal of fixed assets.  prior to april 1, 2016, other income, net also included interest earned on funds held for clients.
31
provision for income taxes our consolidated financial statements include a provision for income taxes incurred for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. under this method, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as for any operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized.
results of operations the following tables set forth selected consolidated statements of income data and such data as a percentage of total revenues for each of the periods indicated:

(iv) growth in the number of employees of our clients, (v) an increase in average revenues per client as we continued to sell our applications to larger clients, (vi) additional revenues in the first quarter attributable to the strong performance of our tax form filing business and (vii) additional revenues in the fourth quarter resulting from clients seeking to accelerate implementation of our enhanced aca application that we believe would have typically deferred implementation until after year-end. as a result of increased sales, implementation and other revenues, a component of total revenues, increased to $4.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 from $2.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, representing an increase of $2.0 million, or 71%.

provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended december 31, 2016, income tax expense decreased as a percentage of revenue compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2015.  the decrease primarily resulted from the recognition of excess tax benefits from share-based payment awards due to the company's adoption of accounting standards update no. 2016-09, "compensation - stock compensation (topic 718):  improvements to employee share-based payment accounting" ("asu 2016-09").  see note 2 under adoption of new pronouncements for further discussion in connection with the adoption of asu 2016-09.

quarterly revenues trends excluding changes in quarterly revenues due to seasonal factors, our quarterly revenues increased sequentially for the periods presented due to a combination of factors, including the addition of clients in mature sales offices, as well as contributions from sales offices that are reaching maturity, the addition of new clients in more recently opened sales offices and the sale of additional applications to our existing clients. there are also seasonal factors that affect our revenues. recurring revenues include revenues relating to the annual processing of payroll forms such as form w-2 and form 1099, as well as the processing and filing of aca-related forms. because these forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year, first quarter revenue and margins are generally higher than subsequent quarters. in addition, unscheduled payroll runs at the end of the year often result in increased revenue in the fourth quarter.
quarterly expenses trends sales and marketing expenses are generally higher in the fourth and first quarters as sales representatives achieve sales goals throughout the year, resulting in higher commission rates. these sales goals reset annually on february 1.
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, which totaled $60.2 million and $50.7 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. our cash and cash equivalents are comprised primarily of demand deposit accounts,
36
money market funds and certificates of deposit. we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over at least the next 12 months.
we have historically financed our operations from cash flows generated from operations, cash from the sale of debt and equity securities and borrowings under our loans. since inception, we have raised $125.1 million of equity capital, $64.3 million of which was the net proceeds raised in our initial public offering that closed in april 2014. we incurred related party debt as part of corporate reorganizations that occurred in april 2012 and january 2014.  such debt has since been repaid.  although we have funded most of the costs for ongoing construction projects at our corporate headquarters from available cash, we have incurred indebtedness for a portion of these costs.  further, to date, all purchases under our stock repurchase plan have been paid for from available cash and, to the extent we repurchase additional shares in the future, we expect to continue to use cash.
recent liquidity developments withholding shares to cover taxes.  during the year ended december 31, 2016, we withheld 302,424 shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations with respect to the delivery of vested shares of restricted stock to certain employees.  our payment of the taxes on behalf of those employees resulted in an expenditure of $14.4 million in cash and, as such, we subtract the amounts attributable to such withheld shares from the aggregate amount available for future purchases under our stock repurchase plan.
stock repurchase plan.  on may 26, 2016, we announced that our board of directors approved a stock repurchase plan under which we were authorized to purchase (in the aggregate) up to $50 million of our outstanding common stock, par value $0.01 per share, over a 24-month period.  during the year ended december 31, 2016, we repurchased an aggregate of 1.1 million shares of common stock (including shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations, as discussed above) for an aggregate cost of $50.0 million.  on february 8, 2017, we announced that our board of directors amended and extended this stock repurchase plan, such that we are authorized to purchase (in the aggregate) up to an additional $50.0 million of common stock through january 2019.
oklahoma city economic development trust incentive.  in the first quarter of 2016, we entered into a local incentive package with the oklahoma city economic development trust worth up to approximately $1.2 million, depending on the number of new jobs we create for local employees through 2021 and the average annual salary level for such employees.
2021 consolidated loan. as of december 31, 2016, we had a term note under the 2021 consolidated loan due to kirkpatrick bank that matures on may 30, 2021 (the "2021 consolidated loan") with an outstanding principal balance of $25.0 million. under the 2021 consolidated loan, interest is payable monthly and accrues at a fixed rate of 4.75% per annum. the 2021 consolidated loan is secured by a mortgage covering our headquarters and certain personal property relating to our headquarters.
we are required to comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants under the 2021 consolidated loan, including maintaining a fixed charge coverage ratio of ebitda to fixed charges (defined as current maturities of long-term debt, interest expense, rent expense and distributions) of greater than 1.2 to 1.0, which is measured on a quarterly basis. further, until amounts under the 2021 consolidated loan are repaid, we may not, subject to certain exceptions, (i) create any mortgages or liens, (ii) make any loans, advances or extensions of credit with certain affiliates or enter into any other transactions with certain affiliates, (iii) lease any mortgaged property, (iv) make any distributions as long as an event of default exists, (v) make any material change in methods of accounting, (vi) enter into any sale and leaseback arrangement, (vii) amend, modify, restate, cancel or terminate our organizational documents, (viii) sell, transfer or convey any mortgaged property or (ix) incur funded outside debt. an event of default under the 2021 consolidated loan includes, among other events, (i) failure to pay principal or interest when due, (ii) breaches of certain covenants, (iii) any failure to meet the required financial covenants and (iv) an institution of bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation or receivership.  as of december 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the 2021 consolidated loan.
2015 construction loan and 2023 term loan.  on may 13, 2015, we entered into a loan agreement with kirkpatrick bank to partially finance the construction of our third headquarters building (the "2015 construction loan").  the 2015 construction loan allowed us to borrow a maximum aggregate principal amount equal to the lesser of (i) $11.0 million or (ii) 80% of the appraised value of the constructed property.  on august 1, 2016, we converted the $5.0 million outstanding principal balance of the 2015 construction loan into an 84-month term loan ("2023 term loan") with interest payable monthly and accruing at a fixed rate of 3.4% per annum.
at december 31, 2016, the principal balance outstanding on the 2023 term loan was $4.9 million.  the 2023 term loan matures on august 31, 2023 and is secured by a mortgage covering our headquarters and certain personal property relating to our headquarters.  the 2023 term loan includes the same covenants as those disclosed above with respect to the 2021 consolidated loan.  we were in compliance with all of the covenants as of december 31, 2016.
2016 construction loan.  on august 2, 2016, we entered into a new construction loan with kirkpatrick bank, which is available to finance the ongoing construction of a fourth headquarters building and new parking garage (the "2016 construction loan").  as of december 31, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under the 2016 construction loan.  the 2016 construction loan allows us to borrow a maximum aggregate principal amount equal to the lesser of (i) $28.6 million or (ii) 80% of the appraised value of the constructed properties.  the 2016 construction loan matures on the earlier of the completion of construction or february 2, 2019, with interest accruing at the greater of (i) the prime rate, plus 50 basis points or (ii) 4.0%.  at maturity, the outstanding principal
37
balance of the 2016 construction loan, if any, will be automatically converted to an 84-month term loan that will accrue fixed interest at the prevailing 7/20 london interbank offered rate swap interest rate in effect as of the commencement date, plus 225 basis points cash flow analysis our cash flows from operating activities have historically been significantly impacted by profitability, implementation revenues received but deferred, research and development, and our investment in sales and marketing to drive growth. our ability to meet future liquidity needs will be driven by our operating performance and the extent of continued investment in our operations. failure to generate sufficient revenues and related cash flows could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our liquidity needs and achieve our business objectives.
as our business grows, we expect our capital expenditures and our investment activity to continue to increase. depending on certain growth opportunities, we may choose to accelerate investments in sales and marketing, acquisitions, technology and services. actual future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our future revenues, cash from operating activities and the level of expenditures in all areas of our business, and may use available cash to repurchase shares of our common stock.
as part of our payroll and payroll tax filing services, we collect funds from our clients for federal, state and local employment taxes, which we remit to the appropriate tax agencies. we invest these funds in money market funds, demand deposit accounts, commercial paper and certificates of deposit from which we earn interest income during the period between their receipt and disbursement.
our cash flows from investing and financing activities are influenced by the amount of funds held for clients, which varies significantly from quarter to quarter. the balance of the funds we hold depends on our clients' payroll calendars, and therefore such balance changes from period to period in accordance with the timing of each payroll cycle.
our cash flows from financing activities are also affected by the extent to which we use available cash to purchase shares of common stock under our stock repurchase plan as well as restricted stock vesting events that may result in the company paying withholding taxes on behalf of certain employees.
the following table summarizes the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. on an ongoing basis, we continually evaluate our estimates and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. actual amounts and results may materially differ from these estimates made by management under different assumptions and conditions.
certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates, and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position, are described below. accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
adoption of new pronouncements in march 2016, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued asu 2016-09, which simplified the accounting related to certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. the new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recognized within the income statement when share-based payment awards vest or are settled. in addition, cash flows related to excess tax benefits are not separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows in the statement of cash flows.  this guidance also allows us to repurchase more of an employee's vesting shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting, clarifies that all cash payments made to taxing authorities on an employee's behalf for withheld shares be presented as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows, and provides an accounting policy election to account for award forfeitures as they occur or continue to estimate forfeitures. we elected to early adopt the new guidance in the third quarter of 2016.  as such, we are required to present any adjustments as of january 1, 2016, the beginning of the annual period that includes the interim period of adoption. the primary impact of our adoption of asu 2016-09 was the recognition of excess tax benefits in our provision for income taxes of $7.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, which otherwise would have been recognized as paid in capital. early adoption had no impact on retained earnings as of january 1, 2016, or on the comparability of the prior period financial statements as there were no excess tax benefits recognized during 2015. we elected to continue to estimate expected forfeitures to determine the amount of stock compensation cost to be recognized in each period.  the presentation requirements for cash flows related to excess benefits and for cash flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld shares had no impact on any of the periods previously presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
we adopted on a retrospective basis the recently issued guidance by the fasb accounting standards update no. 2015-03, "interest - imputation of interest (subtopic 835-30): simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs" ("asu 2015-03"). asu 2015-03 requires companies with debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to present such issuance costs in the consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability.  our adoption of asu 2015-03 resulted in a reclassification that decreased deposits and other assets by $0.1 million and decreased net long-term debt, less current portion by $0.1 million on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2015. the adoption of asu 2015-03 had no impact on our stockholders' equity or the results of our operations.
revenue recognition our total revenues are comprised of recurring revenues, and implementation and other revenues. we recognize revenues in accordance with accounting standards for software and service companies when all of the following criteria have been met:
•   there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;

•   the service has been or is being provided to the customer;

•   collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and

•   the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.

recurring revenues are derived primarily from our talent acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management and hr management applications. these services are rendered during each client's payroll period with the agreed-upon fee being charged and collected as part of the client's payroll. revenues are recognized at time of billing of each client's payroll period. collectability is reasonably assured as the fees are collected through ach as part of the client's payroll cycle or through direct wire
40
transfer, which minimizes the default risk. our implementation and other revenues represent non-refundable conversion fees which are charged to new clients to offset the expense of new client set-up and revenues from sale of time clocks as part of our employee time and attendance services. because these conversion fees and sale of time clocks relate to our recurring revenues, we have evaluated such arrangements under the accounting guidance that governs multiple element arrangements.
for arrangements with multiple elements, we evaluate whether each element represents a separate unit of accounting. in order to treat deliverables in a multiple element arrangement as separate units of accounting, the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery. if the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately and revenue is recognized for the respective deliverables as they are delivered. if one or more of the deliverables does not have standalone value upon delivery, the deliverables that do not have standalone value are generally combined with the final deliverable within the arrangement and treated as a single unit of accounting.
for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we determined that there was no standalone value associated with the upfront conversion fees as they did not have value to our clients on a standalone basis nor were they offered as an individual service; therefore, the conversion fees were deferred and are recognized ratably over the estimated life of our clients, based on our historical client attrition rate, which we estimate to be ten years. revenues from the sale of time clocks are recognized when they are delivered.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is not amortized, but we are required to test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually, or earlier if, at the reporting unit level, an indicator of impairment arises. the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. if impairment exists, a write-down to fair value is recorded. our business is largely homogeneous and, as a result, goodwill is associated with one reporting unit. we have selected june 30 as our annual goodwill impairment testing date and determined there was no impairment as of june 30, 2016. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, there were no indicators of impairment. intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
impairment of long-lived assets long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. we have determined that there is no impairment of long-lived assets for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
restricted common stock in connection with a corporate reorganization (the "2014 reorganization") completed in anticipation of our initial public offering ("ipo"), on january 1, 2014 we issued 8,121,101 shares of restricted stock (the "2014 restricted stock") under the paycom software, inc. 2014 long-term incentive plan (the "ltip") and 1,148,520 shares of common stock, in each case upon conversion of outstanding incentive units of paycom payroll holdings, llc ("holdings"). vested incentive units were converted to shares of common stock and 2014 restricted stock at various conversion ratios that ranged from approximately 1:02 to 1:24. unvested incentive units were converted to shares of 2014 restricted stock at various conversion ratios that ranged from 1:24 to 1:47. the conversion ratios were determined based on the underlying conditions of the pre-conversion incentive units and reflected any pre-existing vesting conditions.
given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock and incentive units prior to our ipo, and in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants (the "aicpa"), audit and accounting practice aid series: valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation, our board of directors exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous factors existing at such time in order to determine the best estimate of the fair value of the 2014  restricted stock and incentive units, including:
•   valuation analyses performed by an unrelated third-party specialist (including the application of appropriate valuation techniques and inputs);

•   characteristics and specific terms of the shares as noted in the equity grant agreements;

•   value of the shares as determined by the absence of a liquidation value on the date of grant, the ability to participate in our future profits, growth and appreciation and the lack of an exercise price for the shares;

•   lack of marketability of our common stock;

•   our historical and actual operating and financial performance;

41
•   our stage of development;

•   revenue and expense projections;

•   likelihood of achieving a liquidating event (ipo or sale);

•   market performance of comparable publicly traded companies;

•   industry factors; and

•   overall u.s. and global economic and capital market conditions.

we used a monte carlo simulation model to value the 2014 restricted stock and for restricted stock with market-based vesting conditions issued after our ipo.  our simulation model requires various subjective assumptions as inputs, including expected life, volatility, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield. the assumptions used in the simulation model represent our best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment as follows:
•   risk-free interest rate - for purposes of valuing shares of 2014 restricted stock, we determined the risk-free interest rate based on the implied yield available on 5 year u.s. treasury securities. for purposes of valuing shares of restricted stock issued following our ipo, we determine the risk-free interest rate based on an implied yield available on u.s. treasury securities ranging from 5 to 10 year maturities, with a term equivalent to that of the restricted stock as of the valuation date.

•   volatility - we determined the volatility input based on the historical volatilities of comparable guideline companies. to determine the comparable guideline companies, we consider cloud-based application providers and select those that are similar to us in nature of services provided. we intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until information regarding the volatility of our own pricing changes, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation.

•   expected life -the expected life represents the period that the shares of restricted stock are expected to be outstanding. we determined the expected life assumption based on the vesting terms and contractual terms of the restricted stock.

•   expected dividend yield -we have not paid dividends and therefore apply an expected dividend yield of 0%. our board of directors will determine if and when dividends will be declared and paid in the future based on our financial position at the relevant time.

the fasb accounting standards codification, section 718-20-53-3 indicates that if the terms and conditions of an existing equity incentive compensation plan are to be modified, then an entity should record additional compensation cost for any incremental value associated with the modification. the incremental compensation cost is measured as the excess of the fair value of the modified awards over the fair value of the original awards immediately before its terms are modified. based on the terms of the 2014 restricted stock, we concluded that there was a modification of the existing equity incentive units. based upon a valuation by an independent third-party, management determined there was no additional compensation cost created in the conversion, as the value of the incentive units given up was less than the value of the 2014 restricted stock received. as such, there was no additional compensation recorded.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we issued an aggregate of 741,931 shares of restricted stock under the ltip to all of our executive officers and certain employees (the "2015 restricted stock"). during the year ended december 31, 2016, we issued (i) an aggregate of 1,575,429 shares of restricted stock under the ltip to all of our executive officers, certain employees and certain members of our board of directors (the "2016 restricted stock" and, collectively with the 2014 restricted stock and the 2015 restricted stock, the "ltip stock").  all shares of ltip stock are subject to either time-based or market-based vesting conditions.
the following tables present a summary of the grant-date fair values and related assumptions with respect to shares of ltip stock. the grant-date fair values were determined based on the monte carlo simulation model.

in addition to assumptions used in the simulation model, we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest. our forfeiture estimate is based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures. we will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover, and other factors.

with respect to shares of 2014 restricted stock subject to market-based vesting conditions, 50% of such shares vested when the company's total enterprise value (as defined in the applicable restricted stock award agreement, "tev") reached $1.4 billion on december 1, 2014 and 50% of such shares vested when the company's tev reached $1.8 billion on march 2, 2015. with respect to shares of 2015 restricted stock subject to market-based vesting conditions ("2015 market-based ltip stock"), 50% of such shares vested when the company's tev reached $2.65 billion on august 1, 2016, and the remaining 50% will vest if the company's tev equals or exceeds $3.5 billion.  the tev threshold for shares of 2016 restricted stock subject to market-based vesting conditions ("2016 market-based ltip stock") varies depending on the grant date. all shares of 2016 market-based ltip stock granted on april 15, 2016 vested when the company's tev reached $2.65 billion on july 28, 2016.  due to differences in the number of shares outstanding at the respective grant dates, which affected the tev calculation, there was a two trading day gap between the vesting of shares of 2016 market-based ltip stock and shares of 2015 market-based ltip stock at the $2.65 billion tev threshold. the remaining shares of 2016 market-based ltip stock are subject to tev vesting thresholds of $3.9 billion and $4.2 billion.

recent accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the fasb issued accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606)." this authoritative guidance includes a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. the fasb has since issued several additional amendments to this guidance. in april 2015, the fasb proposed a one year deferral of the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard for public and non-public entities reporting under u.s. gaap and on july 9, 2015, the fasb approved the one year deferral.  the effective date of the amended standard will begin in periods beginning after december 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted but no earlier than for reporting periods beginning after december 31, 2016. the company has an ongoing project to assess the impact of the standard that has been conducted with the assistance of an international accounting firm. the company has not fully determined the impact of the new revenue recognition standard on its systems, processes and consolidated financial statements; however, we expect the new standard will have a material impact on the manner in which we account for certain costs to acquire new contracts (i.e., selling and commission costs) and costs to fulfill contracts (i.e., costs related to implementation services performed). generally, as it relates to these types of costs, the provisions of the new standard will result in the deferral of these costs on the consolidated balance sheets and subsequently the amortizing of these costs to the consolidated statements of income over the expected life of our client relationships, which we have determined to be an average of 10 years. the company is still evaluating whether implementation services contain an implied performance obligation in the form of a material right to the customer and if so, what impact that would have on the recognition of implementation revenues.  we expect to complete our assessment process, including selecting a transition method for adoption, by the end of the third quarter of 2017 and will complete our implementation process prior to the adoption of this asu on january 1, 2018.
44
in july 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-11, "inventory (topic 330): simplifying the measurement of inventory."  under the new guidance, an entity should measure inventory (as defined within the scope of the guidance) at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  the new guidance applies to all inventory except inventory measured using last-in, first-out (lifo) or the retail inventory method.  net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predicable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.  the new guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  accordingly, the standard is effective for us on january 1, 2017.  we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in january 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-01, "financial instruments - overall (subtopic 825-10):  recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities."  the amendments in this guidance require all equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for under equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee). the amendments in this guidance also require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. in addition the amendments in this guidance eliminate the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet for public business entities. the new guidance is effective for us for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.
in february 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-02 "leases (topic 842)." the purpose of the guidance is to increase the transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet as well as providing additional disclosure requirements related to leasing arrangements. the new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2018, though early adoption is permitted.  full retrospective application is prohibited. we anticipate that the adoption of this accounting standard will materially affect our consolidated balance sheets and may require changes to the system and processes that we use to account for leases. we have not yet made any decision on the timing of adoption or method of adoption with respect to the optional practical expedients.
non-gaap financial measures management uses adjusted ebitda and non-gaap net income as supplemental measures to review and assess the performance of our core business operations and for planning purposes. we define (i) adjusted ebitda as net income plus interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, net loss on early repayment of debt and certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations, and (ii) non-gaap net income as net income plus non-cash stock-based compensation expense, net loss on early repayment of debt and certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations, each of which is adjusted for the effect of income taxes. adjusted ebitda and non-gaap net income are metrics that provide investors with greater transparency to the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.  we believe these metrics are useful to investors because they facilitate comparisons of our core business operations across periods on a consistent basis, as well as comparisons with the results of peer companies, many of which use similar non-gaap financial measures to supplement results under u.s. gaap.  in addition, adjusted ebitda is a measure that provides useful information to management about the amount of cash available for reinvestment in our business, repurchasing common stock and other purposes.  management believes that the non-gaap measures presented in this form 10-k, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business and performance.
adjusted ebitda and non-gaap net income are not measures of financial performance under u.s. gaap, and should not be considered a substitute for net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measure. adjusted ebitda and non-gaap net income have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, you should not consider adjusted ebitda or non-gaap net income in isolation, or as a substitute for net income or other consolidated statements of income data prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. adjusted ebitda and non-gaap net income may not be comparable to similar titled measures of other companies and other companies may not calculate such measures in the same manner as we do.

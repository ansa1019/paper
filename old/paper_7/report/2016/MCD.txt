item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview description of the business the company franchises and operates mcdonald's restaurants. of the 36,899 restaurants in 120 countries at year-end 2016, 31,230 were franchised (reflects 21,559 franchised to conventional franchisees, 6,300 licensed to developmental licensees and 3,371 licensed to foreign affiliates ("affiliates")-primarily japan) and 5,669 were operated by the company.
under mcdonald's conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and décor of their restaurant business, and by reinvesting in the business over time. the company generally owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. this maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees enabling restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry. in certain circumstances, the company participates in the reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants in an effort to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives.
under mcdonald's developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the company generally has no capital invested. in addition, the company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market.
mcdonald's is primarily a franchisor and believes franchising is paramount to delivering great-tasting food, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. franchising enables an individual to be his or her own employer and maintain control over all employment-related matters, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the financial strength and global experience of mcdonald's. however, directly operating restaurants is important to being a credible franchisor and provides company personnel with restaurant operations experience. in company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, mcdonald's further develops and refines operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that the company believes are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants. mcdonald's continually reviews its mix of company-operated and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance, with a goal to be approximately 95% franchised over the long term.
the company's revenues consist of sales by company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. fees vary by type of site, amount of company investment, if any, and local business conditions. these fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms.
the business is structured into the following segments that combine markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth, and reflect how management reviews and evaluates operating performance:
•   u.s. - the company's largest segment.
•   international lead markets - established markets including australia, canada, france, germany, the u.k. and related markets.
•   high growth markets - markets that the company believes have relatively higher restaurant expansion and franchising potential including china, italy, korea, the netherlands, poland, russia, spain, switzerland and related markets.
•   foundational markets &amp; corporate - the remaining markets in the mcdonald's system, each of which the company believes have the potential to operate under a largely franchised model. corporate activities are also reported within this segment.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, the u.s., international lead markets and high growth markets accounted for 34%, 29% and 25% of total revenues, respectively.
in analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures which are considered to be non-gaap, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, systemwide sales growth, return on incremental invested capital ("roiic"), free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate, as described below.
•   constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases most incentive compensation plans on these results because the company believes this better represents its underlying business trends.
•   comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of the impact of the company's initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the company or franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. typically, pricing has a greater impact on average check than product mix. the goal is to achieve a relatively balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check.
•   systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants. while franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the company, management believes the information is important in understanding the company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.
•   roiic is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. the return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. the calculation uses a constant average mcdonald's corporation 2016 annual report 13
foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation.
•   free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the company's ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value.
strategic direction and financial performance the strength of the alignment among the company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the "system") is key to mcdonald's long-term success. by leveraging the system, mcdonald's is able to identify, implement and scale ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. mcdonald's continually builds on its competitive advantages of system alignment and geographic diversification to deliver consistent, yet locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers as an integral part of their communities.
progress on the company's turnaround the turnaround plan, introduced in 2015, represented a significant step change in how mcdonald's operates and a recommitment to putting customers first. with an aspiration of being recognized by customers as a modern and progressive burger company, the company prioritized fewer, more strategic initiatives that focused on running better restaurants, driving operational growth, returning excitement to the brand and enhancing financial value.
building on these initial steps, the company made purposeful changes in 2016. the company continued to right-size the organization and put the appropriate talent in place by blending executives with deep mcdonald's experience with new executives to generate fresh energy and innovative ideas, while successfully executing against the key elements of its turnaround plan. as reflected by improved customer satisfaction measures across most of the major markets, customers have taken notice.
in addition to the customer-relevant changes in the restaurants, the company has enhanced financial value through its refranchising efforts, cost savings initiatives and cash return to shareholders, as follows:
•   refranchising - the company expects to achieve its refranchising target of 4,000 restaurants by the end of 2017, a full year ahead of the original target date, with a long-term goal to become approximately 95% franchised. since 2015, the company has pursued its refranchising goal through the expansion of its conventional franchisee base and the addition of new developmental licensees that bring strong strategic capabilities and financial resources that will enable accelerated expansion and innovation.
moving to a more heavily franchised business model will benefit the company's performance over the long term, as the rent and royalty income received from franchisees will provide a more predictable and stable revenue stream with significantly lower operating costs and risks. this model is less capital intensive as franchisees are responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses.
•   cost savings - the company made meaningful progress towards its goal of reducing net g&amp;a levels by $500 million by the end of 2018 from the company's g&amp;a base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015. actions taken in 2015 and 2016, including the redesign of the organization to eliminate layers and increase spans of control, more centralization of non-customer facing business processes and execution against its refranchising targets, have resulted in savings of more than $200 million.
•   cash return to shareholders - the strength and reliability of the company's significant and growing free cash flow, strong investment grade credit rating and continued access to credit provide the flexibility to fund capital expenditures as well as return cash to shareholders. by the end of 2016, the company achieved its three-year target of $30 billion cash return to shareholders. optimization of the company's capital structure by adding a meaningful amount of additional debt was instrumental in meeting this target.
2016 financial performance the company's progress in executing the turnaround plan is evident by its stronger business results, including the highest comparable sales growth since 2011. in mcdonald's heavily franchised business model, growing comparable sales is key to increasing operating income and returns. in 2016, global comparable sales increased 3.8%, including positive comparable sales across all segments. comparable guest counts were negative 0.3%, as positive guest traffic in the foundational markets and international lead markets was more than offset by negative guest traffic in the u.s. and high growth markets.
•   comparable sales in the u.s. increased 1.7%, due in part to a higher average check, while comparable guest counts declined 2.1% amidst continued industry softness. the growth in comparable sales was supported by all-day breakfast and everyday value under the mcpick 2 platform.
•   comparable sales in the international lead markets increased 3.4% and comparable guest counts increased 1.5%, reflecting solid comparable sales performance across most of the segment, led by the u.k.
•   in the high growth markets, comparable sales increased 2.8%, while comparable guest counts declined 0.8%. the increase in comparable sales reflected positive results across most of the segment, led by china.
•   comparable sales in the foundational markets increased 10.0% and comparable guest counts increased 1.9%, led by very strong performance in japan and certain markets in latin america, as well as solid results across the remainder of the segment.
in addition to improved comparable sales performance, the company achieved the following financial results in 2016:
•   consolidated revenues decreased 3% (flat in constant currencies) due to the impact of refranchising, partly offset by positive comparable sales.
•   systemwide sales increased 3% (5% in constant currencies).
•   consolidated operating income increased 8% (11% in constant currencies).
•   operating margin, defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues, increased from 28.1% in 2015 to 31.5% in 2016.
•   diluted earnings per share of $5.44 increased 13% (16% in constant currencies).
•   cash provided by operations was $6.1 billion.
•   capital expenditures of $1.8 billion were allocated mainly to reinvestment in existing restaurants and, to a lesser extent, to new restaurant openings. across the system, about 900
14 mcdonald's corporation 2016 annual report restaurants were opened and over 1,700 existing locations were reimaged.
•   free cash flow was $4.2 billion and the company's free cash flow conversion rate was 90% (see reconciliation in exhibit 12).
•   one-year roiic was 62.7% and three-year roiic was 5.1% for the period ended december 31, 2016 (see reconciliation in exhibit 12).
•   the company increased its quarterly cash dividend per share by 6% to $0.94 for the fourth quarter, equivalent to an annual dividend of $3.76 per share.
•   the company returned $14.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases for the year, achieving the company's targeted return of $30 billion for the three-year period ended 2016.
strategic direction building on the momentum established in 2016, the company is beginning to shift focus from revitalizing the business to longer-term growth. the company will move with increased velocity to drive sustainable guest count growth, a reliable long-term measure of the company's strength that is vital to growing the company's sales and shareholder value.
in order to drive guest count growth in an ever-changing customer environment, the company developed a customer-centric growth strategy for 2017 and beyond, informed by deep customer research across multiple markets. the company's greatest opportunities are at the heart of the brand - in its food, value and customer experience - and within defined customer groups. this strategy is built on the following three pillars, which will position mcdonald's as a modern and progressive burger company that "makes delicious, feel good moments easy for everyone."
•   retaining existing customers. the company will renew its focus on areas where the company already has a strong foothold in the ieo, including family occasions and food-led breakfast.
•   regaining lost customers. the company plans to regain customers by recommitting to areas of historic strength, namely quality, convenience and value.
•   converting casual to committed customers. the company will focus on building stronger relationships with customers so they visit more often, by elevating and leveraging the mccafé coffee brand and enhancing snack and treat offerings.
the company will continue to build upon its investments in experience of the future ("eotf"), which focuses on restaurant modernization and technology, in order to transform the restaurant service experience. the company is also accelerating its pursuit of the following two initiatives designed to further drive growth.
•   digital. as the company accelerates its pace of converting restaurants to eotf, it is placing renewed emphasis on improving its existing service model (i.e., eat in, take out, or drive-thru) and strengthening its relationships with customers through technology. by evolving the technology platform, the company will simplify how customers order, pay and are served through additional functionality on its global mobile app, self-order kiosks and technology-driven models that enable table service and curb-side pick-up.
•   delivery. the company is accelerating its focus and investment on its delivery platform as a way to expand the convenience customers expect from mcdonald's. the company is conducting various pilot tests in the u.s., europe and asia and plans to scale quickly based on results of these pilots.
areas of focus by segment u.s.
while the u.s. has begun to build sales momentum, its greatest opportunity is guest count growth, by focusing on actions that collectively transform the customer experience.
a focus on food taste and quality will remain a key priority, including offering the company's best tasting burger. in 2017, the u.s. is planning to introduce its signature crafted offering, a premium platform focused on authentic ingredients that allows customers to customize their sandwiches. in addition, the u.s. will remain focused on strengthening its customer-relevant value proposition.
the u.s. expects to launch its mobile order and pay functionality as well as curbside pick-up across all traditional restaurants in the fourth quarter 2017. further, most of the system's traditional restaurants are expected to be converted to eotf by 2020. in addition, the u.s. will continue to test its delivery platform.
international lead markets the international lead markets are deepening their connection with customers and meeting their changing needs with meaningful enhancements in menu, accessibility and experience.
the segment is focused on providing quality, great taste, value and choice across the entire menu. entry-level value programs appeal to teens and young adults, while other platforms provide budget-conscious customers affordable meal bundles. programs across the segment are energizing the core menu, and every market has successfully extended into premium chicken and beef with locally relevant offerings. all of this is supported by modernized cooking and service platforms that expand capacity and enable hotter, fresher products. the segment will also remain focused on enhancing and expanding the mccafé coffee brand and pastry offerings.
the international lead markets continues to lead the mcdonald's system in the development and deployment of eotf.
high growth markets mcdonald's high growth markets have leveraged learnings from the international lead markets to enhance the customer experience through design, digital, people, menu innovation and value.
in addition to driving operational growth in existing restaurants, targeted new restaurant development and refranchising initiatives are top priorities. in early 2017, the company announced the planned sale of its businesses in china and hong kong to a developmental licensee.
foundational markets the foundational markets is a diverse group of markets that share common goals of enhancing the critical elements that differentiate mcdonald's - the menu and the customer experience. the segment is committed to running great restaurants and increasing convenience to customers, including through drive-thru and delivery. the foundational markets continue to pursue refranchising opportunities, including the sale of certain markets to developmental licensees. in early 2017, the company announced the planned sale of its businesses in the nordic markets (denmark, finland, norway and sweden) to a developmental licensee.

outlook
2017 outlook the following global and certain segment-specific information is provided to assist in forecasting the company's future results.
•   changes in systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. the company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 1 percentage point to 2017 systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies).
•   the company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. however, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point change in comparable sales for either the u.s. or the international lead segment would change annual diluted earnings per share by about 4 to 5 cents.
•   with about 75% of mcdonald's grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the company's commodity costs. for the full-year 2017, costs for the total basket of goods are expected to increase about 0.5-1.5% in the u.s. and increase about 2.0% in the international lead segment.
•   the company expects full-year 2017 selling, general and administrative expenses to decrease about 7-8%, in constant currencies with fluctuations expected between the quarters. this includes incentive-based compensation costs of less than $300 million.
•   based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the company expects interest expense for the full-year 2017 to increase about 5-10% compared with 2016 due to higher average debt balances.
•   a significant part of the company's operating income is generated outside the u.s., and about 35% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the euro, british pound, australian dollar and canadian dollar. collectively, these currencies represent approximately 70% of the company's operating income outside the u.s. if all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the company's annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 25 cents.
•   the company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2017 to be in the 31-33% range. some volatility may result in a quarterly tax rate outside of the annual range.
•   the company expects capital expenditures for 2017 to be approximately $1.7 billion, about one-third of which will be used to open new restaurants. the company expects to open about 900 restaurants, including about 500 restaurants in affiliated and developmental licensee markets where the company generally does not fund any capital expenditures. the company expects net additions of about 400 restaurants. the remaining two-thirds of capital will be used to reinvest in existing locations, including about 650 reimages in the u.s. when combined with previously modernized restaurants that will be updated with eotf elements in 2017, we expect to have about 2,500 eotf restaurants in the u.s. by the end of 2017.
long-term outlook
•   the company expects to refranchise about 4,000 restaurants in the three-year period ending 2017, with a long-term goal to become approximately 95% franchised.
•   the company expects to realize net annual g&amp;a savings of about $500 million from its g&amp;a base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015. through the end of 2016, the company realized cumulative savings of more than $200 million and expects to realize the majority of its savings target by the end of 2017. beyond its $500 million reduction, the company expects to further reduce g&amp;a by 5-10% from the remaining g&amp;a base by the end of 2019. these targets exclude the impact of foreign currency changes.
•   the company expects capital expenditures to decline by approximately $500 million from the 2017 level of $1.7 billion, once the u.s. restaurant modernization work is substantially completed.
•   the company expects to return between $22 and $24 billion to shareholders for the three-year period ending 2019. this new target contemplates proceeds from future restaurant sales expected under its ongoing refranchising initiative. as the business grows, the company also expects to modestly increase its debt levels, while maintaining its credit metrics within current ranges.
long-term financial targets the company has established the following long-term, average annual (constant currency) financial targets, beginning in 2019, with variability expected during 2017 and 2018 due to the impact of refranchising:
•   systemwide sales growth of 3-5%;
•   operating margin in the mid-40% range;
•   earnings per share growth in the high-single digits; and
•   roiic in the mid-20% range.

net income and diluted earnings per common share in 2016, net income increased 3% (6% in constant currencies) to $4.7 billion and diluted earnings per common share increased 13% (16% in constant currencies) to $5.44. foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.11 on diluted earnings per share.
in 2015, net income decreased 5% (increased 5% in constant currencies) to $4.5 billion and diluted earnings per common share was relatively flat (increased 10% in constant currencies) at $4.80. foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.50 on diluted earnings per share.
results in 2016 benefited from stronger operating performance and higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses, mostly in the u.s., while results in 2015 benefited from higher franchised margins and a gain on the strategic sale of a unique restaurant property in the u.s.
both 2016 and 2015 results were partly offset by net pre-tax impairment and other charges of $342 million and $307 million, respectively, primarily related to goodwill impairment and other asset write-offs in conjunction with the company's refranchising initiatives, restructuring and incremental restaurant closings. the 2015 charges combined with the gain on the strategic sale of a unique restaurant property in the u.s. had a net negative impact on diluted earnings per share of $0.18 in 2015, while the 2016 charges had a net negative impact on diluted earnings per share of $0.28 in 2016.
the company repurchased 92.3 million shares of its stock for $11.1 billion in 2016 and 61.8 million shares of its stock for $6.2 billion in 2015, driving reductions in weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods, which positively benefited earnings per share.

revenues the company's revenues consist of sales by company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales, minimum rent payments and initial fees. revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees.
the company continues to accelerate the pace of refranchising to optimize its restaurant ownership mix, generate more stable and predictable revenue and cash flow streams, and operate with a less resource-intensive structure. the shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants negatively impacts consolidated revenues as company-operated sales are replaced by franchised sales, where the company receives rent and/or royalty revenue based on a percentage of sales.
in 2016, revenues decreased 3% (flat in constant currencies) due to the impact of refranchising, partly offset by positive comparable sales. in 2015, revenues decreased 7% (increased 3% in constant currencies), partly due to foreign currency translation. in constant currencies, revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales and the benefit from expansion.

franchised margins franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised restaurants less the company's occupancy costs (rent and depreciation) associated with those sites. franchised margin dollars represented about 75% of the combined restaurant margins in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
in 2016, franchised margin dollars increased $331 million or 5% (6% in constant currencies). in 2015, franchised margin dollars decreased $297 million or 4% (increased 4% in constant currencies), due to foreign currency translation. for both 2016 and 2015, the constant currency increases were due to positive comparable sales performance, expansion and refranchising.
in connection with the company's refranchising initiatives, the company expects to refranchise about 4,000 restaurants for the three-year period ending 2017. while this refranchising activity may have a dilutive effect on the franchised margin percent, it typically results in higher franchised margin dollars.

•   u.s.: in 2016, the increase in the company-operated margin percent was due to a higher average check and lower commodity costs, partly offset by the impact of negative guest counts and higher labor costs. in 2015, the decrease was primarily due to the incremental investment in wages and benefits for eligible company-operated restaurant employees, effective july 1, 2015, designed to improve restaurant performance and enhance our employment proposition.

selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales was 2.8% in 2016, 2.9% in 2015 and 2.8% in 2014. management believes that analyzing selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support the overall mcdonald's business.
in connection with our turnaround plan, the company established a net selling, general and administrative savings target of $500 million to be achieved by the end of 2018, excluding the effects of any foreign currency changes. these savings represent a reduction of about 20% from our selling, general and administrative base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015. this base included incentive-based compensation of approximately $330 million, which assumed achievement of planned operating performance. in 2014, the lower incentive-based compensation reflected nominal payouts for the company's short-term cash bonus program.

•   u.s.: in 2016, the increase in operating income reflected higher sales-driven franchised margin dollars and higher gains from sales of restaurant businesses, partly offset by the negative impact from lapping the 2015 gain on the strategic sale of a unique restaurant property. in 2015, the increase was primarily due to the aforementioned gain on sale of property and higher franchised margin dollars, partly offset by lower company-operated margin dollars reflecting higher costs associated with the incremental investment in wages and benefits for eligible company-operated restaurant employees, effective july 1, 2015. in addition, 2015 results were negatively impacted by restructuring and restaurant closing charges.
•   international lead markets: in 2016, the constant currency operating income increase was primarily due to sales-driven improvements in franchised margin dollars across most markets. in 2015, the operating income decrease was due to foreign currency translation. in constant currencies, the operating income increase was primarily due to higher franchised margin dollars, benefiting from positive comparable sales performance.

interest expense interest expense increased 39% and 11% in 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to higher average debt balances in connection with the company's strategy to optimize its capital structure, partly offset by lower average interest rates.

22 mcdonald's corporation 2016 annual report provision for income taxes in 2016, 2015 and 2014, the reported effective income tax rates were 31.7%, 30.9% and 35.5%, respectively.
in 2014, the higher effective income tax rate was primarily due to a change in tax reserves for 2003-2010 resulting from an unfavorable lower tax court ruling in a foreign tax jurisdiction, as well as the impact of changes in tax reserves related to audit progression in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions. these items had a negative impact of 4.1% on the effective tax rate.
consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $2.0 billion in 2016 and $1.8 billion in 2015. substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the u.s. and other profitable markets.
recently issued accounting standards recently issued accounting standards are included in part ii, item 8, page 34 of this form 10-k.
cash flows the company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases.
cash provided by operations totaled $6.1 billion and free cash flow was $4.2 billion in 2016, while cash provided by operations totaled $6.5 billion and free cash flow was $4.7 billion in 2015. in 2016, cash provided by operations decreased $480 million or 7% compared with 2015, primarily due to higher income tax payments primarily outside the u.s. and other working capital changes, partly offset by higher net income. in 2015, cash provided by operations decreased $191 million or 3% compared with 2014 primarily due to lower operating results, including the impact from weaker foreign currencies, and other operating activity, partly offset by changes in working capital.
cash used for investing activities totaled $982 million in 2016, a decrease of $438 million compared with 2015. the decrease primarily reflected higher proceeds from sales of restaurant businesses. cash used for investing activities totaled $1.4 billion in 2015, a decrease of $885 million compared with 2014. the decrease primarily reflected lower capital expenditures.
cash used for financing activities totaled $11.3 billion in 2016, an increase of $12.0 billion compared with 2015, primarily due to a decrease in net borrowings and higher treasury stock purchases. cash provided by financing activities totaled $735 million in 2015, an increase of $5.4 billion compared with 2014, primarily due to an increase in net borrowings, partly offset by higher treasury stock purchases.
the company's cash and equivalents balance was $1.2 billion and $7.7 billion at year end 2016 and 2015, respectively. the decrease was mostly due to higher net borrowings in 2015 that were used for share repurchases in 2016. in addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements.
restaurant development and capital expenditures in 2016, the company opened 896 restaurants and closed 522 restaurants. in 2015, the company opened 989 restaurants and closed 722 restaurants. the increase in restaurant closings in 2015 reflected a strategic review that resulted in additional closures of under-performing restaurants. the company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure.

approximately 85% of the restaurants at year-end 2016 were franchised, including 92% in the u.s., 84% in international lead markets, 48% in high growth markets and 94% in foundational markets.
capital expenditures in 2016 were essentially flat with 2015, primarily due to higher reinvestment related to reimages, offset by fewer new restaurant openings. capital expenditures decreased $769 million or 30% in 2015, primarily due to fewer new restaurant openings and lower reinvestment at existing restaurants.
capital expenditures invested in the u.s., international lead markets and high growth markets represented over 90% of the total in 2016, 2015 and 2014.

(1)   primarily corporate equipment and other office-related expenditures new restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with strong returns or opportunities for long-term growth. average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. these costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, and leveraging best practices. although the company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional mcdonald's restaurants in the u.s. averaged approximately $3.4 million in 2016.
the company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2016 and 2015.
share repurchases and dividends in 2016, the company returned $14.2 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid, marking the achievement of the company's targeted return of $30 billion for the three-year period ended 2016.

mcdonald's corporation 2016 annual report 23
in december 2015, the company's board of directors approved a $15 billion share repurchase program, effective january 1, 2016, with no specified expiration date. in 2016, approximately 92.3 million shares were repurchased for $11.1 billion under the program.
the company has paid dividends on its common stock for 41 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. the 2016 full year dividend of $3.61 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.89 per share, with an increase to $0.94 per share paid in the fourth quarter. this 6% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $3.76 per share annual dividend and reflects the company's confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. as in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the company's board of directors.
financial position and capital resources total assets and returns total assets decreased $6.9 billion or 18% in 2016 primarily due to lower cash and equivalents. nearly 85% of total assets were in the u.s., international lead markets and high growth markets at year-end 2016. net property and equipment decreased $1.9 billion in 2016, primarily due to the impact of depreciation and the reclass of the assets of china, hong kong, and taiwan markets to assets of businesses held for sale, partly offset by capital expenditures. net property and equipment represented about 70% of total assets at year end.
operating income and month-end asset balances are used to compute return on average assets. for the years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014, return on average assets was 23.0%, 20.9% and 21.8%, respectively.
in 2016, return on average assets increased due to higher operating income and lower average assets. in 2015, return on average assets decreased primarily due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation on operating income, partly offset by lower average assets. operating income does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. the inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by about three percentage points for all years presented.
financing and market risk the company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. debt obligations at december 31, 2016 totaled $26.0 billion, compared with $24.1 billion at december 31, 2015. the net increase in 2016 was primarily due to net long-term issuances of $2.7 billion.

standard & poor's and moody's currently rate, with a stable outlook, the company's commercial paper a-2 and p-2, respectively; and its long-term debt bbb+ and baa1, respectively. to access the debt capital markets, the company relies on credit-rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings.
certain of the company's debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. there are no provisions in the company's debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the company's business. under existing authorization from the company's board of directors, at december 31, 2016, the company had $15.0 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. in addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the u.s. securities and exchange commission ("sec") and a global medium-term notes program, the company has $2.5 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the u.s. and global markets (see debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements). debt maturing in 2017 is $1.6 billion of long-term corporate debt. the company plans to issue long-term debt to refinance this maturing debt. as of december 31, 2016, the company's subsidiaries also had $489 million of borrowings outstanding, primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements, of which $297 million is classified in liabilities of businesses held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet.
the company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. the company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. the company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. all swaps are over-the-counter instruments.
in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. the company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. this reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders' equity. total foreign currency-denominated debt was $8.9 billion and $7.0 billion for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. in addition, where practical, the company's restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. see the summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives.
the company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. at december 31, 2016, the company was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to negative fair value of certain
24 mcdonald's corporation 2016 annual report derivative positions. the company's counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the company's supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions.
the company's net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. the company's largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows:
foreign currency net asset exposures in millions of u.s. dollars        2016            2015
euro                             $1,968          $3,974

japanese yen                        490             363
the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company's results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the u.s. dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company's anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets. based on the results of these analyses of the company's financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2016 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2016 levels would materially affect the company's results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments.
liquidity the company has significant operations outside the u.s. where we earn about 60% of our operating income. a significant portion of these historical earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the company has made, and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations. accordingly, no u.s. federal or state income taxes have been provided on these undistributed foreign earnings. the company's cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $663 million as of december 31, 2016. we do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate these funds.
consistent with prior years, we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, annual repatriation of a portion of the current period's foreign earnings, and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating, investing, and financing activities. we also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating, investing, and financing activities.
in the future, should we require more capital to fund activities in the u.s. than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions. this could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the future.
while the likelihood is remote, to the extent foreign cash is available, the company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested. upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the company may be subject to additional u.s. income taxes (net of an adjustment for foreign tax credits), which could result in a use of cash. this could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings. refer to the income taxes note to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our income taxes and the undistributed earnings of the company's foreign subsidiaries.
contractual obligations and commitments the company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. in addition, the company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the company's borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. the following table summarizes the company's contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the company under existing franchise arrangements as of december 31, 2016. see discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

in the u.s., the company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of internal revenue service ("irs") limitations. at december 31, 2016, total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $465 million.
in addition, total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $924 million at december 31, 2016.
there are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business, and timing of such payments are not mcdonald's corporation 2016 annual report 25
estimable or determinable. the amounts related to these commitments are not significant to the company's financial position. such commitments are generally shorter term in nature and will be funded from operating cash flows.
other matters critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. on an ongoing basis, the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from these estimates.
the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. the company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity:
•   property and equipment property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management's estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.
•   businesses held for sale assets and liabilities of businesses held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet primarily consist of balances related to businesses in china and hong kong. in december 2016, the company's board of directors approved an agreement for the company to sell its existing businesses in china and hong kong, which comprise over 2,600 restaurants, to a developmental licensee organization. under the terms of the agreement, the company will retain a 20% ownership in the business. the company expects to complete the sale and licensing transaction mid-year 2017, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, including receipt of any regulatory approvals.
based on approval by the board of directors, the company concluded that these markets were "held for sale" as of december 31, 2016 in accordance with the requirements of asc 360 "property, plant and equipment". accordingly, the company has ceased recording depreciation expense with respect to the assets of the china and hong kong markets effective january 1, 2017. as of december 31, 2016, total assets relating to businesses in china and hong kong were $1.3 billion, of which $217 million was current, and total liabilities were $592 million, most of which was current.
as a result of this sale, the company expects to record a gain of approximately $700-$900 million reflecting the difference between the net book value of the businesses and an estimated $1.5 billion of cash proceeds to be received at closing, subject to adjustments.
•   share-based compensation the company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units ("rsus") to employees and nonemployee directors. the expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. the company estimates forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation costs to be recognized in each period.
the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. the pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the company's stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company's stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period.
•   long-lived assets impairment review long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. in assessing the recoverability of the company's long-lived assets, the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company's experience and knowledge of its operations. these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. a key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. if the company's estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to record impairment charges. based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, approximately 5-10% of goodwill may be at risk of future impairment as the fair values of certain reporting units were not substantially in excess of their carrying amounts.
•   litigation accruals in the ordinary course of business, the company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. a determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. the company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.

•   income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. this could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made.
the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter.
in 2016, the company increased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken in prior years by $150 million. in 2015, the company decreased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to settlements with taxing authorities by $258 million. see the income taxes footnote in the consolidated financial statements for the related tax reconciliations. the most significant new developments in 2015 and 2016 are described below.
in 2015, the company received an unfavorable decision related to its procedural efforts to appeal a prior year unfavorable lower tax court ruling in a foreign tax jurisdiction related to exempt income matters. as a result of this new information, the company agreed to settle the issue for 2003-2008 with the tax authorities and the unrecognized tax benefits were reduced by $143 million. no cash payment was made related to this settlement in 2015 as the company had previously made a payment to the taxing authority. the settlement did not have a material impact on the company's cash flows, results of operations or financial position. in 2016, the unrecognized tax benefits related to this issue for 2009-2010 were reduced by $57 million as a result of the lapsing of the statute of limitations.
in 2015, the internal revenue service ("irs") issued a revenue agent report for certain agreed adjustments related to the company's u.s. federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010 and the balance of unrecognized tax benefits was reduced by $102 million. also in 2015, the company filed a protest with the irs appeals office related to certain disagreed transfer pricing matters related to the company's u.s. federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. as of december 31, 2016, the company had not yet received a response to this protest from the irs. the company expects resolution on these issues in either 2017 or 2018. in addition, the company's 2011 and 2012 u.s. federal income tax returns are currently under examination and the completion of the field audit is expected in 2017.
in 2016, the company received new information during the progression of tax audits in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions. as a result of this new information, the company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of $125 million.
in december 2015, the european commission opened a formal investigation directly with the luxembourg government to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid. if this matter is adversely resolved, luxembourg may be required to assess, and the company may be required to pay, additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. as of december 31, 2016, no decision has been published with respect to this investigation.
while the company cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the aforementioned tax matters, we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined in accordance with topic 740 - income taxes of the accounting standards codification ("asc").
deferred u.s. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $16.0 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. the temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the u.s. if management's intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided.
effects of changing prices-inflation the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. this ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation.

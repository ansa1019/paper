item 7
. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data of this report and the matters described under item 1a. risk factors.
management's overview we believe the quality and scale of our global operating portfolio, the expertise of our team and the strength of our balance sheet give us unique competitive advantages. our plan to grow revenues, earnings, noi, cash flows and funds from operations is based on the following:
•   rent growth. we expect market rents to continue to grow over the next few years, albeit at a more modest pace, which we believe will be driven by demand for the location and quality of our properties. because of the strong market rent growth in the last several years, even if market rents remain flat, our in-place leases have considerable room to rise back to market levels. we estimate that on an aggregate basis our leases are more than 10% below market, which when the lease is renewed, translates

22
into increased future earnings, noi and cash flow, both on a consolidated basis and through the amounts we recognize from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures based on our ownership. this is reflected in the positive rent change on rollovers (when comparing the net effective rent of the new lease to the prior lease for the same space) on our owned and managed operating portfolio that we have experienced every quarter beginning in 2013 and which we expect to continue for several more years.

•   value creation from development. we believe a successful development and redevelopment program involves maintaining control of well-positioned land. on the basis of our current estimates, our owned and managed land bank has the potential to support the development of $8.4 billion of tei of logistics space. we believe the carrying value of our land bank is below its current fair value, and we expect to realize this value going forward primarily through development. during 2016, in our owned and managed portfolio, we stabilized development projects with a tei of $2.5 billion. post stabilization, we estimate the value of these buildings to be 25.5% above their book value or the cost to develop (defined as estimated margin and calculated using estimated yield and capitalization rates from our underwriting models). in addition, these properties will generate an increase in noi as they are leased up and become occupied.

•   economies of scale from growth in assets under management. over the last several years, we have invested in a variety of technologies that have allowed us to achieve efficiencies and increase our investments in real estate with minimal increases to general and administrative ("g&amp;a") expenses. we have increased our owned and managed real estate assets by 85 million square feet (or approximately 16%) over the last two years primarily through acquisitions and integrated the assets with only minimal increases in overhead related to property management and leasing functions. we will continue to leverage these technologies in order to further streamline our operations and reduce our costs as a percentage of assets under management, along with advanced data analysis to enhance decision making.

summary of 2016
during the year ended december 31, 2016, operating fundamentals remained strong for our owned and managed portfolio and we ended the year with occupancy of 97.1%. see below for details of the operating and development activity of our owned and managed portfolio. during 2016, we completed the following activities as further described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements:
•   we generated net proceeds of $3.0 billion from the contribution and disposition of real estate assets. we recorded net gains of $354 million from dispositions to third parties, primarily in the u.s., and $267 million from property contributions, principally in europe and japan.

•   we earned promotes from pep ii, ptelf and uslv aggregating $96 million, of which $89 million was recorded in strategic capital revenues, and $7 million was recorded in net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.

•   we generated proceeds of $611 million and recorded gains of $136 million through the redemption of our investments in certain unconsolidated co-investment ventures.

•   we amended our global senior credit facility (the "global facility") and increased the total borrowing capacity to $3.0 billion and extended the maturity until april 2020. this facility, along with our japanese yen revolver, increased our total borrowing capacity, which was $3.3 billion at december 31, 2016.

•   we entered into an ¥120.0 billion ($1.0 billion at december 31, 2016) unsecured yen senior term loan agreement (the "yen term loan") and repaid our existing yen term loans. see liquidity and capital resources section below for details of this transaction.

in january 2017, we sold our investment in elv to our fund partner and elv contributed its properties to ptelf in exchange for equity interests.
results of operations we evaluate our business operations based on the noi of our two business reporting segments, real estate operations and strategic capital. noi by segment is a non-gaap financial measure that is calculated using revenues and expenses directly from our financial statements. we consider noi by segment to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance because it helps both management and investors to understand the core operations of our business.
below is a reconciliation of our noi by segment to operating income per the consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31 (in millions). each segment's noi is reconciled to a line item in the consolidated financial statements in the respective segment discussion below.

see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our segments and a reconciliation of each reportable business segment's noi to operating income and earnings before income taxes.
real estate operations this operating segment principally includes rental revenues, rental recoveries and rental expenses recognized from our consolidated properties. we allocate the costs of our property management functions to the real estate operations segment through rental expenses and the strategic capital segment through strategic capital expenses based on the size of the relative portfolios as compared to our total owned and managed portfolio. the operating fundamentals in the markets in which we operate continue to improve, which has positively affected both the rental rates and occupancy and also has fueled development activity.
below are the components of real estate operations revenues, expenses and noi for the years ended december 31 (in millions), derived directly from line items in the consolidated financial statements.

real estate operations revenues, expenses and noi are impacted by capital deployment activities, occupancy and changes in rental rates. the following items highlight the key changes in noi for the years ended december 31 (in millions):
change in

2016 from 2015              2015 from 2014
acquisitions (1)                                            $194                        $279
rent rate and occupancy growth (2)                            89                          76
development activity (3)                                      39                          17
contributions and dispositions                               (91   )                     (98   )
other (4)                                                     48                          15
total change in real estate operations - noi                $279                        $289
(1)   the impact from acquisitions in 2016 from 2015 was primarily due to the acquisition of the real estate assets and operating platform of ktr capital partners and its affiliates ("ktr") in may 2015, which generated an additional $152 million of net revenues, including a decrease of $25 million acquisition costs in 2016.

the impact from acquisitions in 2015 from 2014 included the ktr transaction in 2015 and the consolidation of naif in 2014. ktr included an additional $176 million of net revenues, which was slightly offset by $25 million in acquisition costs.
in the fourth quarter of 2014, we consolidated our co-investment venture naif, which increased noi $153 million in 2015 from 2014.
approximately 45% and 34% of ktr and naif activity, respectively, is offset in net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests attributable to our venture partner's share. see note 3 in the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the ktr transaction and naif consolidation.
(2)   rent rate growth is a combination of the turnover of existing leases and increases in rental rates from contractual rent increases on existing leases. if a lease has a contractual rent increase that is not known at the time the lease is signed, such as the consumer price index or a similar metric, the rent increase is not included in rent leveling and therefore, would impact the rental revenues we recognize. we have experienced an increase in rental rates on turnover of existing leases every quarter beginning in 2013 that has resulted in higher average rental rates in our portfolio and increased rental revenues and noi as those leases commenced.

(3)   we have had a steady increase in properties that have been completed and leased from 2014 to 2016.

24
(4)   other items increased noi in 2016, compared to 2015, such as additional property tax expense recoveries, a reduction of noncash adjustments for the amortization of above or below market leases and decreases in non-recoverable expenses.

below are key operating metrics of our consolidated operating portfolio for the years ended december 31:
strategic capital this operating segment includes revenues from asset management and other fees as well as promotes earned for services performed for our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. revenues associated with the strategic capital segment fluctuate because of the size of co-investment ventures under management, the transactional activity in the ventures and the timing of promotes. these revenues are reduced generally by the direct costs associated with the asset management and property-level management for the properties owned by these ventures. we allocate the costs of our property management functions to the strategic capital segment through strategic capital expenses and to the real estate operations segment through rental expenses based on the size of the relative portfolios as compared to our total owned and managed portfolio.

(1)   in 2014, we acquired a controlling interest in our co-investment venture naif. see notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on this venture.

(2)   the promotes represent the third parties' share based on the venture's cumulative returns to the investors over the last three years. approximately 40% of promote revenues are paid as a combination of cash and stock awards pursuant to the terms of the prologis promote plan and expensed through strategic capital expenses.

(3)   this includes compensation and personnel costs for employees who are located in the u.s. but also support other regions.

(4)   in 2014, we formed the co-investment venture fibra prologis. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on this venture.

g&a expenses g&a expenses increased $5 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the same time period in 2015, primarily due to increased compensation, including equity-based compensation awards. g&a expenses decreased $12 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the same time period in 2014, primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and the british pound sterling, euro and japanese yen.

our owned and managed properties we manage our business on an owned and managed basis, which includes properties wholly owned by us or owned by one of our co-investment ventures. we review our operating fundamentals on an owned and managed basis. we believe reviewing these fundamentals this way allows management to understand the entire impact to the financial statements, as it will affect both the real estate operations and strategic capital segments, as well as the net earnings we recognize from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures based on our ownership share. we do not control the unconsolidated co-investment ventures for purposes of gaap and the presentation of the ventures' operating information does not represent a legal claim to such items.
our owned and managed portfolio includes operating properties and does not include properties under development or held for sale to third parties and was as follows at december 31 (square feet in millions):

operating activity below is information summarizing the leasing activity of our owned and managed operating portfolio for the years ended december 31:
(1)   we retained at least 80% of our customers, based on the total square feet of leases signed, for each year during the three-year period ended december 31, 2016.

(2)   turnover costs represent the obligations incurred in connection with the signing of a lease, including leasing commissions and tenant improvements.

for information on our development portfolio at december 31, 2016, see item 2. properties.
same store analysis we evaluate the operating performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a "same store" analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period, thereby eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of the portfolio on performance measures. we include properties from our owned and managed portfolio in our same store analysis. we have defined the same store portfolio, for the three months ended december 31, 2016, as those properties that were in operation at january 1, 2015, and have been in operation throughout the same three-month periods in both 2016 and 2015 (including development properties that have been completed and available for lease). we have removed all properties that were disposed of to a third party or were classified as held for sale to a third party from the population for both periods. we believe the factors that affect rental revenues, rental expenses and noi in the same store portfolio are generally the same as for the total operating portfolio. to derive an appropriate
28
measure of period-to-period operating performance, we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the recent period end exchange rate to translate from local currency into the u.s. dollar, for both periods.
same store is a commonly used measure in the real estate industry. our same store measures are non-gaap financial measures that are calculated beginning with rental revenues, rental recoveries and rental expenses from the financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap. as our same store measures are non-gaap financial measures, they have certain limitations as analytical tools and may vary among real estate companies. as a result, we provide a reconciliation from our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap to same store property noi with explanations of how these metrics are calculated.
the following is a reconciliation of our consolidated rental revenues, rental recoveries, rental expenses and property noi for the full year, as included in the consolidated statements of income and within note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, to the respective amounts in our same store portfolio analysis for the three months ended december 31 (dollars in millions):

(1)   we include 100% of the same store noi from the properties in our same store portfolio. during the periods presented, certain properties owned by us were contributed to a co-investment venture and are included in the same store portfolio. neither our consolidated results nor those of the co-investment ventures, when viewed individually, would be comparable on a same store

29
basis because of the changes in composition of the respective portfolios from period to period (e.g. the results of a contributed property are included in our consolidated results through the contribution date and in the results of the unconsolidated entities subsequent to the contribution date).

(2)   we exclude the net termination and renegotiation fees from our same store rental revenues to allow us to evaluate the growth or decline in each property's rental revenues without regard to items that are not indicative of the property's recurring operating performance. net termination and renegotiation fees represent the gross fee negotiated to allow a customer to terminate or renegotiate their lease, offset by the write-off of the asset recorded due to the adjustment to straight-line rents over the lease term. the adjustments to remove these items are included in "effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other" in this table.

(3)   rental expenses include the direct operating expenses of the property such as property taxes, insurance and utilities. in addition, we include an allocation of the property management expenses for our direct-owned properties based on the property management services provided to each property (generally, based on a percentage of revenues). on consolidation, these amounts are eliminated and the actual costs of providing property management services are recognized as part of our consolidated rental expenses. these expenses fluctuate based on the level of properties included in the same store portfolio and any adjustment is included as "effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other" in this table.

other components of income (expense)
earnings from unconsolidated entities, net we recognized net earnings from unconsolidated entities that are accounted for using the equity method of $206 million, $159 million and $134 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the earnings we recognize can be impacted by: (i) variances in revenues and expenses of each venture; (ii) the size and occupancy rate of the portfolio of properties owned by each venture; (iii) gains or losses from the dispositions of properties; (iv) our ownership interest in each venture; and (v) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate our share of net earnings to u.s. dollars.
see the discussion of our co-investment ventures above in the strategic capital segment discussion and in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a further breakdown of our share of net earnings recognized.
interest expense the following table details our net interest expense for the year ended december 31 (dollars in millions):

gross interest expense decreased in 2016, compared with 2015, principally from lower outstanding debt balances and borrowing costs during the periods. our debt decreased by $1.0 billion from december 31, 2015, to december 31, 2016, primarily from the repayment of the senior term loan related to the ktr transaction with proceeds from contributions and dispositions. gross interest expense increased in 2015, compared with 2014, due to higher debt driven by the ktr transaction, offset somewhat by a decrease in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a further breakdown of gross interest expense, amortization and capitalized amounts included in net interest expense. see also the liquidity and capital resources section for further discussion of our debt and borrowing costs.
gains on dispositions of investments in real estate and revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest, net over the last three years, we have contributed properties, generally that we had developed, to our co-investment ventures in europe, japan and mexico, as included in the table below. we recognize a gain to the extent of the third party ownership in the venture acquiring the property. in 2014, our contribution activity included the properties that we contributed to fibra prologis upon its formation.
in addition, we have sold properties to third parties, generally from our operating portfolio in the u.s. these dispositions have supported our strategic objective of owning a portfolio of high-quality properties in the most active centers of commerce.
we utilize the proceeds from both contributions and dispositions to fund our capital investments.

gains (losses) on early extinguishment of debt, net we repurchased portions of several series of senior notes, senior exchangeable notes and secured mortgage debt that resulted in the recognition of a gain of $2 million in 2016 and losses of $86 million and $165 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. as a result of these transactions, we reduced our effective interest rate and lengthened the maturities of our debt. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our debt repurchases.
income tax expense (benefit)
we recognize current income tax expense for income taxes incurred by our taxable reit subsidiaries, state and local income taxes and taxes incurred in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. our current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable income. deferred income tax expense (benefit) is generally a function of the period's temporary differences and the utilization of net operating losses generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets in taxable subsidiaries operating in the u.s. or in foreign jurisdictions.

see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our consolidated co-investment ventures.
other comprehensive loss during 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded net losses in our statement of comprehensive income related to foreign currency translations of our foreign subsidiaries into u.s. dollars upon consolidation. these losses were principally due to the weakening of the brazilian real, british pound sterling, euro and japanese yen to the u.s. dollar.
during 2016, 2015 and 2014, we also recorded unrealized losses in our statement of comprehensive income, related to the change in fair value of our cash flow hedges and our share of derivatives in our unconsolidated co-investment ventures.
see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our foreign currency and derivative policies and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our derivative transactions and other comprehensive losses.
other matters on june 23, 2016, the u.k. passed a referendum to leave the european union. our key business driver remains intact, and we have not seen, nor do we anticipate, a material operational or financial impact. our customers in the u.k. principally serve domestic consumers and we do not expect the decision to leave the european union will materially change the consumption habits that drive our business. at december 31, 2016, our owned and managed u.k. operating portfolio was 99.5% leased and had a weighted average lease term of nine years with only 4.6% of the leases expiring in 2017. the u.k. portfolio contributes approximately 4% of our share of annual noi through consolidated entities and co-investment ventures.
environmental matters a majority of the properties we acquired were subjected to environmental reviews either by us or the previous owners. while some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling, none of the environmental assessments have revealed an
32
environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. see note 17 in the consolidated financial statements for further information about environmental liabilities.
liquidity and capital resources overview we consider our ability to generate cash from operating activities, distributions from our co-investment ventures, dispositions of properties and from available financing sources to be adequate to meet our anticipated future development, acquisition, operating, debt service, dividend and distribution requirements.
near-term principal cash sources and uses in addition to dividends to the common and preferred stockholders of prologis and distributions to the holders of limited partnership units of the operating partnership and our partners in the consolidated co-investment ventures, we expect our primary cash needs will consist of the following:
•   completion of the development and leasing of the properties in our consolidated development portfolio (at december 31, 2016, 89 properties in our development portfolio were 59.8% leased with a current investment of $1.4 billion and a tei of $2.4 billion when completed and leased, leaving $1.0 billion remaining to be spent);

•   development of new properties for long-term investment, including the acquisition of land in certain markets;

•   capital expenditures and leasing costs on properties in our operating portfolio;

•   repayment of debt and scheduled principal payments of $622 million in 2017;

•   additional investments in current unconsolidated entities or new investments in future unconsolidated co-investment ventures;

•   acquisition of operating properties or portfolios of operating properties (depending on market and other conditions) for direct, long-term investment in our consolidated portfolio (this might include acquisitions from our co-investment ventures); and

•   repurchase of our outstanding debt or equity securities (depending on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors) through cash purchases, open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise.

we expect to fund our cash needs principally from the following sources (subject to market conditions):
•   available unrestricted cash balances ($807 million at december 31, 2016);

•   property operations;

•   fees earned for services performed on behalf of the co-investment ventures, including promotes;

•   distributions received from the co-investment ventures;

•   proceeds from the disposition of properties, land parcels or other investments to third parties;

•   proceeds from the contributions of properties to current or future co-investment ventures;

•   proceeds from the sale of a portion of our investments in co-investment ventures;

•   borrowing capacity under our current credit facility arrangements discussed in the following section, other facilities or borrowing arrangements ($3.2 billion available at december 31, 2016); and

•   proceeds from the issuance of debt.

we may also generate proceeds from the issuance of equity securities, subject to market conditions.

weighted average maturity in months              60                  67
in the first quarter of 2016, we repaid the $400 million remaining balance on the senior term loan that was used to fund the ktr transaction with proceeds generated from the contributions of development properties to our co-investment ventures and proceeds generated from the disposition of certain nonstrategic properties to third parties.
in march 2016, we entered into an unsecured term loan agreement under which we could draw in japanese yen in an aggregate amount not to exceed ¥11.2 billion that was scheduled to mature in march 2017. in the first quarter of 2016, we borrowed ¥11.2 billion ($100 million) on this term loan.
in april 2016, we amended the global facility and increased our aggregate borrowing capacity to $3.0 billion in august 2016, we entered into the yen term loan under which we can draw in japanese yen in an aggregate amount not to exceed ¥120.0 billion ($1.0 billion at december 31, 2016) bearing interest at yen libor plus 0.65%, of which ¥50.0 billion ($427 million at december 31, 2016) matures in august 2022 and ¥70.0 billion ($598 million at december 31, 2016) matures in august 2023. we may increase the borrowings up to ¥200.0 billion ($1.7 billion at december 31, 2016), subject to obtaining additional lender commitments. in the third quarter of 2016, we borrowed on the yen term loan and used the proceeds to repay the previously outstanding japanese yen term loans entered into in 2014, 2015 and 2016. the yen term loan was fully drawn at december 31, 2016.
at december 31, 2016, we had credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $3.3 billion, of which $3.2 billion was available for borrowing.
at december 31, 2016, our credit ratings were a3 from moody's and a- from s&p, both with stable outlook. a securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization.
at december 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. these covenants include customary financial covenants for total debt, encumbered debt and fixed charge coverage ratios.
see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our debt.
equity commitments related to certain co-investment ventures certain co-investment ventures have equity commitments from us and our venture partners. our venture partners fulfill their equity commitment with cash. we may fulfill our equity commitment through contributions of properties or cash. see the cash flow summary below for more information about our investment activity in our co-investment ventures. for more information on equity commitments for our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
cash flow summary the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the years ended december 31 (in millions):
2016                2015               2014

net cash provided by operating activities                    $1,417              $1,116           $894
net cash provided by (used in) investing activities          $1,252             $(4,789   )       $(665     )
net cash provided by (used in) financing activities         $(2,125   )          $3,596           $(351     )
cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities, exclusive of changes in receivables and payables, is impacted by the following significant activity:
•   real estate operations. we receive the majority of our operating cash through net revenues of our real estate operations segment. see our results of operations section above for further explanation of our real estate operations segment. the revenues from this segment include noncash adjustments for straight-lined rent and amortization of above and below market leases of $94 million, $60 million and $14 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

•   strategic capital. we also generate operating cash through our strategic capital segment by providing management services to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, including promotes. see our strategic capital results of operations section above for the key drivers of our strategic capital revenues and expenses. included in the cash provided by operating activities for 2016 is $30 million of cash received from promotes, which represented the third-party share and was accrued as strategic capital revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015.

34
•   g&amp;a expenses. we incurred $222 million, $217 million and $229 million of g&amp;a costs in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

•   distributions from unconsolidated entities. in 2016, we adopted an accounting standard update that clarifies the classification methodology within the statement of cash flows for distributions received from equity method investments. we elected the nature of distributions approach, in which cash flows generated from the operations of an unconsolidated entity are classified as a return on investment (cash inflow from operating activities) and cash flows that are generated from property sales, debt refinancing or redemption of ownership interests are classified as a return of investment (cash inflow from investing activities).

following our adoption of this standard, we recognized $287 million, $285 million and $295 million of distributions from our unconsolidated entities in net cash provided by operating activities in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. included in 2016 are distributions of $27 million that represented our share of promotes earned in 2015. for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, we reclassified $141 million and $177 million of distributions from our unconsolidated entities into net cash provided by operating activities that were previously reported as net cash provided by (used in) investing activities. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more detail on this adoption.
•   equity-based compensation awards. we record equity-based compensation expenses in rental expenses in the real estate operations segment, strategic capital expenses in the strategic capital segment and g&amp;a expenses. the total amounts expensed were $60 million, $54 million and $57 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

•   cash paid for interest and income taxes. we paid combined amounts for interest and income taxes of $352 million, $370 million and $364 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. see note 9 and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on this activity.

cash provided by (used in) investing activities
•   real estate development. we invested $1.6 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, in real estate development and leasing costs for first generation leases. we have 60 properties under development and 29 properties that were completed but not stabilized at december 31, 2016, and we expect to continue to develop new properties as the opportunities arise.

•   real estate acquisitions. in 2016, we acquired total real estate of $459 million, which included 776 acres of land and nine operating properties. in 2015, we acquired total real estate of $890 million, which included 690 acres of land and 52 operating properties, excluding the ktr transaction. in 2014, we acquired 1,040 acres of land and eight operating properties for a combined total of $612 million.

•   ktr transaction, net of cash received. in 2015, we acquired the real estate assets of ktr for a net cash purchase price of $4.8 billion through our consolidated co-investment venture uslv. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more detail on the transaction.

•   capital expenditures. we invested $268 million, $238 million and $213 million in our operating properties during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which included recurring capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions on existing operating properties that were previously leased.

•   proceeds from contributions and dispositions. we generated cash from contributions and dispositions of real estate properties of $2.8 billion, $2.8 billion and $2.3 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for more detail about our contributions and dispositions.

35
•   investments in unconsolidated entities. we invest cash in our unconsolidated co-investment ventures and other ventures, which represented our proportionate share. the ventures use the funds for the acquisition of operating properties, development and repayment of debt. the following table summarizes our investments in our unconsolidated co-investment ventures for the years ended december 31 (in millions):

see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for more detail on our unconsolidated co-investment ventures.
•   purchase of a controlling interest. we paid net cash of $590 million to acquire a controlling interest in naif in 2014.

•   return of investment. as discussed above, we adopted an accounting standard update in 2016 that clarifies the classification methodology within the statement of cash flows for distributions received from equity method investments. as a result, distributions generated from activities outside the operations of our unconsolidated entities, such as property sales, debt refinancing or redemptions of ownership interests, are reflected in net cash provided by (used in) investing activities. we received distributions from unconsolidated co-investment ventures and other ventures as a return of investment of $777 million, $29 million and $84 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. included in this amount for 2016 is $611 million from the sale of a portion of our investments, and the remaining amount was from property dispositions within our unconsolidated co-investment entities. for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, we reclassified $141 million and $177 million, respectively, of distributions from our unconsolidated entities that were previously reported as net cash provided by (used in) investing activities into net cash provided by operating activities.

•   proceeds from repayment of notes receivable backed by real estate. in 2016, we received $203 million for the payment in full of notes receivable received in connection with dispositions of real estate to third parties in 2015. in 2014, we received $188 million for the payment in full of the notes receivable that originated in 2010 through the sale of a portfolio of properties. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about notes receivable.

•   settlement of net investment hedges. we received net proceeds of $80 million, $128 million and $13 million from the settlement of net investment hedges during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our derivative activity.

cash provided by (used in) financing activities
•   proceeds from issuance of common stock.

o   we generated net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our incentive plans, primarily from the exercise of stock options, of $40 million, $18 million and $26 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

o   we generated net proceeds of $72 million and $140 million from the issuance of 2 million shares and 3 million shares of common stock under our at-the-market program during 2015 and 2014, respectively.

o   norges bank investment management exercised a warrant (that we issued in connection with the formation of pelp) for $214 million in exchange for 6 million shares of prologis common stock in 2014.

•   dividends paid on common and preferred stock. we paid dividends of $893 million, $805 million and $672 million to our common and preferred stockholders during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

•   repurchase of preferred stock and units. we paid $28 million to repurchase shares of series q preferred stock in 2014.

•   noncontrolling interests contributions. our partner in uslv made contributions in 2015 of $2.4 billion, primarily for the ktr transaction, and $446 million in 2014 related to the formation of the venture.

36
•   noncontrolling interests distributions. our consolidated ventures distributed $344 million, $216 million and $315 million to various noncontrolling interests in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily due to dispositions of real estate. included in these amounts were $37 million, $16 million and $2 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, of distributions to common limited partnership unitholders of the operating partnership.

•   tax paid for shares withheld. in 2016, we adopted an accounting standard update that clarifies the classification methodology within the statement of cash flows for taxes paid to a tax authority by us when we withhold shares to cover employee withholding tax payments for certain stock compensation plans. as a result of the adoption, we reclassified payments of $12 million and $13 million from net cash provided by operating activities to net cash provided by (used in) financing activities for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

•   net borrowings on credit facilities. we generated net proceeds of $33 million from our credit facilities in 2016. we made net payments of $8 million and $717 million in 2015 and 2014 respectively, on our credit facilities.

•   repurchase and payments of debt. during 2016, we made payments of $1.6 billion on our outstanding term loans, $233 million on regularly scheduled debt principal payments and payments at maturity and repurchased and extinguished secured mortgage debt of $461 million. during 2015, we made payments of $1.0 billion on our outstanding term loans, $128 million on regularly scheduled debt principal payments and payments at maturity and repurchased and extinguished secured mortgage debt of $2.0 billion. during 2014, we made payments of $2.2 billion on our previous term loan, $102 million on regularly scheduled debt principal payments and payments at maturity and repurchased and extinguished senior notes and secured mortgage debt of $1.9 billion.

•   proceeds from issuance of debt. in 2016, we issued $973 million of term loans and $397 million of secured mortgage debt and used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. in 2015, we issued $1.5 billion of senior notes, $565 million of secured mortgage debt and $3.1 billion of term loans and used the net proceeds to fund our share of the purchase price for the ktr transaction, repurchased and redeemed senior notes and for general corporate purposes. in 2014, we issued €1.8 billion ($2.4 billion) of senior notes, $2.3 billion of term loans and $71 million of secured debt. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more detail on debt.

off-balance sheet arrangements unconsolidated co-investment venture debt we had investments in and advances to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, at december 31, 2016, of $4.1 billion. these ventures had total third-party debt of $6.5 billion at december 31, 2016. this debt is primarily secured, is non-recourse to prologis or the other investors in the co-investment ventures, matures and bears interest as follows (dollars in millions):

at december 31, 2016, we did not guarantee any third-party debt of the co-investment ventures. in our role as the manager or sponsor, we work with the co-investment ventures to refinance their maturing debt. there can be no assurance that the co-investment ventures will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness on terms as favorable as the maturing debt, or at all. if the ventures are unable to refinance the maturing indebtedness with newly issued debt, they may be able to obtain funds by voluntary capital contributions from us and our partners or by selling assets. certain of our ventures also have credit facilities, or unencumbered properties, both of which may be used to obtain funds.

(1)   we had properties in our consolidated development portfolio (completed and under development) at december 31, 2016, with a tei of $2.4 billion. the unfunded commitments presented include not only those costs that we are obligated to fund under construction contracts, but all costs necessary to place the property into service, including the estimated costs of tenant improvements, marketing and leasing costs that we expect to incur as the property is leased.

distribution and dividend requirements our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure that we will meet the dividend requirements of the internal revenue code, relative to maintaining our reit status, while still allowing us to retain cash to meet other needs such as capital improvements and other investment activities.
in 2016, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.42 per common share. in 2015, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 for the first two quarters and $0.40 per common share for the last two quarters. our future common stock dividends, if and as declared, may vary and will be determined by the board upon the circumstances prevailing at the time, including our financial condition, operating results and reit distribution requirements, and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year.
in the fourth quarter of 2015, we issued a new class of common limited partnership units in the operating partnership that are entitled to a quarterly distribution equal to $0.64665 per unit so long as the common units receive a quarterly distribution of at least $0.40 per unit. see note 11 in the consolidated financial statements for more information on this new partnership unit class. we paid a distribution of $0.64665 in december 2016 and in december 2015 related to this new partnership unit class. we make distributions to the common limited partnership units outstanding at the same per unit amount as our common stock dividend.
at december 31, 2016, we had 1.6 million shares of one series of preferred stock outstanding - the "series q preferred stock," with a liquidation preference of $50 per share. the annual dividend rate is 8.54% per share and dividends are payable quarterly in arrears. pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock, we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock.
other commitments on a continuing basis, we are engaged in various stages of negotiations for the acquisition or disposition of individual properties or portfolios of properties.
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity's financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management. generally, the judgment requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. estimates are prepared using management's best judgment, after considering past and current economic conditions and expectations for the future. changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance. of the accounting policies discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, those presented below have been identified by us as critical accounting policies.
consolidation we consolidate all entities that are wholly owned and those in which we own less than 100% of the equity but control, as well as any variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. we evaluate our ability to control an entity including whether the entity is a variable interest entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary. we consider the substantive terms of the arrangement to identify which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity. investments in entities that we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted
38
for using the equity method. our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in the consolidated financial statements.
business combinations upon acquisition of real estate that constitutes a business, which includes acquiring a controlling interest in an entity previously accounted for using the equity method of accounting, we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based on the fair value of each component. the components typically include buildings, land, intangible assets related to the acquired leases, debt, deferred tax liabilities and other assumed assets and liabilities. in an acquisition of multiple properties, we allocate the purchase price among the properties. the allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and often is based on the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located. the fair value may also include an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for a portfolio of properties. in the case of an acquisition of a controlling interest in an entity previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting, this allocation may result in a gain or a loss. the initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management's preliminary assessment, which may differ when final information becomes available. subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period, not to exceed one year. the use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired properties and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenues and expenses.
revenue recognition - gains (losses) on dispositions of investments in real estate and strategic capital revenues we recognize gains from the contributions and sales of real estate assets, generally at the time the title is transferred, consideration is received and we no longer have substantial continuing involvement with the real estate sold. in many of our transactions, an entity in which we have an equity investment will acquire a real estate asset from us. we make judgments based on the specific terms of each transaction as to the amount of the total profit from the transaction that we recognize given our continuing ownership interest and our level of future involvement with the entity that acquires the assets. in addition, we make judgments regarding recognition in earnings of certain fees and incentives earned for services provided to these entities based on when they are earned, fixed and determinable.
derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments can be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that at inception, and over the term of the instruments, the hedged item and derivative qualify for hedge accounting. the rules and interpretations for derivatives are complex. failure to apply this guidance correctly may result in all changes in fair value of the hedged derivative being recognized in earnings. we assess both at inception, and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows of the related underlying exposures. any ineffective portion of a derivative financial instrument's change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. derivatives not designated as hedges are used to manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and variable interest rates but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements. the rules and interpretations for derivatives are complex. failure to apply this guidance correctly may result in all changes in fair value of the hedged derivative being recognized in earnings. see notes 2 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our derivative financial instrument policy and our derivative financial instruments.
income taxes significant management judgment is required to estimate our income tax liability for each taxable entity, the liability associated with open tax years that are under review, our reit taxable income and our compliance with reit requirements. our estimates are based on interpretation of tax laws. we estimate our actual current income tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes resulting in the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities. these estimates may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized. adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities; changes in assessments of the recognition of income tax benefits for certain nonroutine transactions; changes due to audit adjustments by federal, international and state tax authorities; our inability to qualify as a reit; the potential for built-in gain recognition; changes in the assessment of properties to be contributed to taxable reit subsidiaries and changes in tax laws. adjustments required in any given period are included within income tax expense. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities.
recoverability of real estate assets we assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable.
recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. to review our real estate assets for recoverability, we consider current market conditions, as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. our intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change. fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, applying a capitalization rate to estimated noi of a property, quoted market values and third-party appraisals, where considered necessary. the use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the
39
strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business. if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of a property that we expect to hold is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the property. assumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows, including market rents, discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with regard to our investment that occurs subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment.
capitalization of costs during the land development and construction periods (including renovating and rehabilitating), we capitalize interest, insurance, real estate taxes and certain general and administrative costs of the personnel performing development, renovations and rehabilitation if such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. the ability to specifically identify internal personnel costs associated with development and the determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease, requires a high degree of judgment and failure to accurately assess these costs and timing could result in the misstatement of asset values and expenses. capitalized costs are included in the investment basis of real estate assets.
new accounting pronouncements see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
funds from operations attributable to common stockholders/unitholders ("ffo")
ffo is a non-gaap financial measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry. the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo is net earnings.
the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") defines ffo as earnings computed under gaap to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales, along with impairment charges, of previously depreciated properties. we also consider the gains on revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest and the gain recognized from a partial sale of our investment to be similar as a gain from the sale of previously depreciated properties under the nareit definition of ffo. we exclude similar adjustments from our unconsolidated entities and the third parties' share of our consolidated ventures.
our ffo measures our ffo measures begin with nareit's definition and we make certain adjustments to reflect our business and the way that management plans and executes our business strategy. while not infrequent or unusual, the additional items we adjust for in calculating ffo, as modified by prologis and core ffo, both as defined below, are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period. although these items may have a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements, the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long term. these items have both positive and negative short-term effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our long-term outlook.
we calculate our ffo measures based on our proportionate ownership share of both our unconsolidated and consolidated ventures. we reflect our share of our ffo measures for unconsolidated ventures by applying our average ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis. we reflect our share for consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100% of the equity by adjusting our ffo measures to remove the noncontrolling interests share of the applicable reconciling items based on our average ownership percentage for the applicable periods.
these ffo measures are used by management as supplemental financial measures of operating performance and we believe that it is important that stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses. we do not use our ffo measures as, nor should they be considered to be, alternatives to net earnings computed under gaap, as indicators of our operating performance, as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under gaap or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs.
we analyze our operating performance primarily by the rental revenues of our real estate and the revenues from our strategic capital business, net of operating, administrative and financing expenses. this income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities.
ffo, as modified by prologis attributable to common stockholders and unitholders ("ffo, as modified by prologis")
to arrive at ffo, as modified by prologis, we adjust the nareit defined ffo measure to exclude:
•   deferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses recognized by our subsidiaries;

•   current income tax expense related to acquired tax liabilities that were recorded as deferred tax liabilities in an acquisition, to the extent the expense is offset with a deferred income tax benefit in earnings that is excluded from our defined ffo measure;

40
•   unhedged foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from debt transactions between us and our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and our foreign unconsolidated entities;

•   foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement (based on current foreign currency exchange rates) of certain third party debt of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and our foreign unconsolidated entities; and

•   mark-to-market adjustments associated with derivative financial instruments.

we use ffo, as modified by prologis, so that management, analysts and investors are able to evaluate our performance against other reits that do not have similar operations or operations in jurisdictions outside the u.s.
core ffo attributable to common stockholders and unitholders ("core ffo")
in addition to ffo, as modified by prologis, we also use core ffo. to arrive at core ffo, we adjust ffo, as modified by prologis, to exclude the following recurring and nonrecurring items that we recognized directly in ffo, as modified by prologis:
•   gains or losses from contribution or sale of land or development properties that were developed with the intent to contribute or sell;

•   income tax expense related to the sale of investments in real estate and third-party acquisition costs related to the acquisition of real estate;

•   impairment charges recognized related to our investments in real estate generally as a result of our change in intent to contribute or sell these properties;

•   gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt and redemption and repurchase of preferred stock; and

•   expenses related to natural disasters.

we use core ffo, including by segment and region, to: (i) assess our operating performance as compared to similar real estate companies and the industry in general, (ii) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods, relative to resource allocation decisions; (iii) evaluate the performance of our management; (iv) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources; (v) provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance; and (v) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results.
limitations on the use of our ffo measures while we believe our modified ffo measures are important supplemental measures, neither nareit's nor our measures of ffo should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under gaap and are, therefore, limited as an analytical tool. accordingly, these are only a few of the many measures we use when analyzing our business. some of these limitations are:
•   the current income tax expenses and acquisition costs that are excluded from our modified ffo measures represent the taxes and transaction costs that are payable.

•   depreciation and amortization of real estate assets are economic costs that are excluded from ffo. ffo is limited, as it does not reflect the cash requirements that may be necessary for future replacements of the real estate assets. furthermore, the amortization of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of logistics facilities are not reflected in ffo.

•   gains or losses from non-development property acquisitions and dispositions or impairment charges related to expected dispositions represent changes in value of the properties. by excluding these gains and losses, ffo does not capture realized changes in the value of acquired or disposed properties arising from changes in market conditions.

•   the deferred income tax benefits and expenses that are excluded from our modified ffo measures result from the creation of a deferred income tax asset or liability that may have to be settled at some future point. our modified ffo measures do not currently reflect any income or expense that may result from such settlement.

•   the foreign currency exchange gains and losses that are excluded from our modified ffo measures are generally recognized based on movements in foreign currency exchange rates through a specific point in time. the ultimate settlement of our foreign currency-denominated net assets is indefinite as to timing and amount. our ffo measures are limited in that they do not reflect the current period changes in these net assets that result from periodic foreign currency exchange rate movements.

•   the gains and losses on extinguishment of debt that we exclude from our core ffo, may provide a benefit or cost to us as we may be settling our debt at less or more than our future obligation.

retrospectively adopted accounting standards in february 2015, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") 2015-02, "consolidation", which changed the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. this guidance changed the conditions to be met in determining if a reporting entity has a variable interest in a legal entity. in accordance with the new accounting guidance, indemnity is not deemed to have a variable interest in the exchange as the fees paid for services provided to the exchange no longer represent a variable interest. the compensation received from the attorney-in-fact fee arrangement with the subscribers is for services provided by indemnity acting in its role as attorney-in-fact and is commensurate with the level of effort required to perform those services. under the previously issued accounting guidance, indemnity was deemed to have a variable interest and was the primary beneficiary of the exchange and its financial position and operating results were consolidated with indemnity. following adoption of the new accounting guidance, the exchange's results are no longer required to be consolidated with indemnity.
indemnity adopted the new accounting standard on a retrospective basis effective with the annual reporting period ending december 31, 2015. the 2014 financial information within this report has been conformed to the presentation in accordance with the amended guidance.
recent accounting standards see part ii, item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 2, significant accounting policies, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report for a discussion of adopted as well as other recently issued accounting standards and the impact on our financial statements if known.
operating overview overview we are a pennsylvania business corporation that since 1925 has been the managing attorney-in-fact for the subscribers (policyholders) at the erie insurance exchange ("exchange"), a reciprocal insurer that writes property and casualty insurance. our primary function is to perform certain services relating to the sales, underwriting and issuance of policies on behalf of the exchange. we operate our business as one segment.
the exchange is a reciprocal insurance exchange organized under article x of pennsylvania's insurance company law of 1921 under which individuals, partnerships, and corporations are authorized to exchange reciprocal or inter-insurance contracts with each other, or with individuals, partnerships, and corporations of other states and countries, providing indemnity among themselves from any loss which may be insured against under any provision of the insurance laws except life insurance.  each applicant for insurance to the exchange signs a subscriber's agreement, which contains an appointment of indemnity as their attorney-in-fact to transact the business of the exchange on their behalf.
pursuant to the subscriber's agreement and for its services as attorney-in-fact, we earn a management fee calculated as a percentage of the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange.
our earnings are primarily driven by the management fee revenue generated for the services we provide relating to certain sales, underwriting, and issuance of policies for the exchange.  management fee revenue is based upon all direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange and the management fee rate, which is not to exceed 25%. our board of directors establishes the management fee rate at least annually, generally in december for the following year.  the process of setting the management fee rate includes the evaluation of current year operating results compared to both prior year and industry
18
estimated results for both indemnity and the exchange, and consideration of several factors for both entities including: their relative financial strength and capital position; projected revenue, expense and earnings for the subsequent year; future capital needs; as well as competitive position.
the management fee rate was set at 25% for 2016, 2015 and 2014.  our board of directors set the 2017 management fee rate again at 25%, its maximum level.
the services we provide to the exchange are related to the sales, underwriting and issuance of policies. the sales related services we provide include agent compensation and certain sales and advertising support services. agent compensation includes scheduled commissions to agents based upon premiums written as well as additional commissions and bonuses to agents, which are earned by achieving targeted measures. agent compensation comprised approximately 69% of our 2016 expenses. the underwriting services we provide include underwriting and policy processing and comprised approximately 10% of our 2016 expenses. the remaining services we provide include customer service and administrative support.
we also provide information technology services that support all the functions listed above that comprised approximately 9% of our 2016 expenses.
by virtue of its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the exchange does not have the ability to enter into contractual relationships and therefore indemnity serves as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the exchange for all claims handling services, investment management services, and certain other common overhead and service department functions in accordance with the subscriber's agreement. the amounts indemnity incurs on behalf of the exchange in this capacity are reimbursed to indemnity from the exchange at cost. see part ii, item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 13, related party, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report.
our results of operations are tied to the growth and financial condition of the exchange as the exchange is our sole customer and our earnings are largely generated from management fees based on the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange. the exchange generates revenue by insuring preferred and standard risks, with personal lines comprising 71% of the 2016 direct and assumed written premiums and commercial lines comprising the remaining 29%.  the principal personal lines products are private passenger automobile and homeowners.  the principal commercial lines products are commercial multi-peril, commercial automobile and workers compensation.
we generate investment income from our fixed maturity, equity security, and limited partnership investment portfolios.  our portfolio is managed with the objective of maximizing after-tax returns on a risk-adjusted basis.  we actively evaluate the portfolios for impairments, and record impairment write-downs on investments in instances where the fair value of the investment is substantially below cost, and it is concluded that the decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, which includes consideration for intent to sell.

nm = not meaningful net revenue from operations increased 25.7% in 2016 as revenue growth outpaced the growth in expenses, and 4.3% in 2015. the two components of our primary revenue source, management fee revenue, are the management fee rate we charge, and the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange. the management fee rate was 25% for both 2016 and 2015. the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange were $6.3 billion in 2016 and $5.9 billion in 2015.
19
total operating expenses increased 2.5% and 7.5% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. the increase in operating expenses for 2016 was driven by an increase in commissions, partially offset by lower non-commission expenses primarily from lower personnel costs across all expense categories. the increase in operating expenses for 2015 was driven primarily by increases in commissions and personnel costs.
gross margin from operations increased to 18.3% in 2016 from 15.4% in 2015.
total investment income decreased in 2016 primarily due to lower earnings generated from limited partnership investments.
reconciliation of net income to operating income we disclose operating income, a non-gaap financial measure, to enhance our investors' understanding of our performance.  our method of calculating this measure may differ from those used by other companies, and therefore comparability may be limited.
we define operating income as net income excluding realized capital gains and losses, impairment losses, and related federal income taxes.
we use operating income to evaluate the results of our operations.  it reveals trends that may be obscured by the net effects of realized capital gains and losses including impairment losses.  realized capital gains and losses, including impairment losses, may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by business decisions and economic developments such as capital market conditions which are not related to our ongoing operations.  we are aware that the price to earnings multiple commonly used by investors as a forward-looking valuation technique uses operating income as the denominator.  operating income should not be considered as a substitute for net income prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") and does not reflect our overall profitability.

general conditions and trends affecting our business economic conditions unfavorable changes in economic conditions, including declining consumer confidence, inflation, high unemployment, and the threat of recession, among others, may lead the exchange's customers to modify coverage, not renew policies, or even cancel policies, which could adversely affect the premium revenue of the exchange, and consequently our management fee.  further, unanticipated increased inflation costs including medical cost inflation, construction and auto repair cost inflation, and tort issues may impact the estimated loss reserves and future premium rates. if any of these items impacted the financial condition or continuing operations of the exchange, it could have an impact on our financial results.
financial market volatility our portfolio of fixed maturity, equity security, and limited partnership investments is subject to market volatility especially in periods of instability in the worldwide financial markets.  over time, net investment income could also be impacted by volatility and by the general level of interest rates, which impact reinvested cash flow from the portfolio and business operations. depending upon market conditions, which are unpredictable and remain uncertain, considerable fluctuation could
20
exist in the fair value of our investment portfolio and reported total investment income, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
critical accounting estimates the financial statements include amounts based upon estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures.  we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 1) it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and 2) different estimates that could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are likely to occur from period-to-period, could have a material impact on our statements of operations or financial position.
the following presents a discussion of those accounting policies surrounding estimates that we believe are the most critical to our reported amounts and require the most subjective and complex judgment.  if actual events differ significantly from the underlying assumptions, there could be material adjustments to prior estimates that could potentially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.  the estimates and the estimating methods used are reviewed continually, and any adjustments considered necessary are reflected in current earnings.
investment valuation available-for-sale securities we make estimates concerning the valuation of all investments.  valuation techniques are used to derive the fair value of the available-for-sale securities we hold.  fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between willing market participants at the measurement date.
fair value measurements are based upon observable and unobservable inputs.  observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information.  we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
for purposes of determining whether the market is active or inactive, the classification of a financial instrument is based upon the following definitions:
•   an active market is one in which transactions for the assets being valued occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide reliable pricing information.
•   an inactive (illiquid) market is one in which there are few and infrequent transactions, where the prices are not current, price quotations vary substantially, and/or there is little information publicly available for the asset being valued.
we continually assess whether or not an active market exists for all of our investments and as of each reporting date re-evaluate the classification in the fair value hierarchy.  all assets carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
•   level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date.
•   level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
•   level 3 - unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
level 1 includes nonredeemable preferred stock and exchange traded funds, and reflects market data obtained from independent sources, such as prices obtained from an exchange or a nationally recognized pricing service for identical instruments in active markets.
level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using industry-standard models that consider various inputs, such as the interest rate and credit spread for the underlying financial instruments.  all significant inputs are observable, or derived
21
from observable information in the marketplace, or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.  financial instruments in this category primarily include u.s. government & agency securities, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, structured securities, redeemable preferred stock and certain nonredeemable preferred stock.
level 3 securities are valued based upon unobservable inputs, reflecting our estimates of value based upon assumptions used by market participants.  securities are assigned to level 3 in cases where non-binding broker quotes are significant to the valuation and there is a lack of transparency as to whether these quotes are based upon information that is observable in the marketplace.  fair value estimates for securities valued using unobservable inputs require significant judgment due to the illiquid nature of the market for these securities and represent the best estimate of the fair value that would occur in an orderly transaction between willing market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions.  fair value for these securities are generally determined using non-binding broker quotes received from outside broker dealers based upon security type and market conditions.  remaining securities, where a price is not available, are valued using an estimate of fair value based upon indicative market prices that include significant unobservable inputs not based upon, nor corroborated by, market information, including the utilization of discounted cash flow analyses which have been risk-adjusted to take into account illiquidity and other market factors.  this category primarily consists of corporate debt securities priced using non-binding broker quotes.
as of each reporting period, financial instruments recorded at fair value are classified based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  the presence of at least one unobservable input that has significant impact to the fair value measurement would result in classification as a level 3 instrument.  our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset, such as the relative impact on the fair value as a result of including a particular input and market conditions.  we did not make any other significant judgments except as described above.
estimates of fair values for our investment portfolio are obtained primarily from a nationally recognized pricing service.  our level 1 category includes those securities valued using an exchange traded price provided by the pricing service.  the methodologies used by the pricing service that support a level 2 classification of a financial instrument include multiple verifiable, observable inputs including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data.  pricing service valuations for level 3 securities are based upon proprietary models and are used when observable inputs are not available in illiquid markets.  in limited circumstances we adjust the price received from the pricing service when, in our judgment, a better reflection of fair value is available based upon corroborating information and our knowledge and monitoring of market conditions such as a disparity in price of comparable securities and/or non-binding broker quotes. in other circumstances, certain securities are internally priced because prices are not provided by the pricing service.
we perform continuous reviews of the prices obtained from the pricing service.  this includes evaluating the methodology and inputs used by the pricing service to ensure we determine the proper classification level of the financial instrument.  price variances, including large periodic changes, are investigated and corroborated by market data.  we have reviewed the pricing methodologies of our pricing service as well as other observable inputs, such as benchmark yields, reported trades, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, and transaction volumes, and believe that the prices adequately consider market activity in determining fair value.  our review process continues to evolve based upon accounting guidance and requirements.
when a price from the pricing service is not available, values are determined by obtaining non-binding broker quotes and/or market comparables.  when available, we obtain multiple quotes for the same security.  the ultimate value for these securities is determined based upon our best estimate of fair value using corroborating market information.  our evaluation includes the consideration of benchmark yields, reported trades, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data.
other-than-temporary impairments investments are evaluated monthly for other-than-temporary impairment loss.  some factors considered in evaluating whether or not a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary include:
•   the extent and duration for which fair value is less than cost;
•   historical operating performance and financial condition of the issuer;
•   short- and long-term prospects of the issuer and its industry based upon analysts' recommendations;
•   specific events that occurred affecting the issuer, including rating downgrades;
•   intent to sell or more likely than not we would be required to sell (debt securities); and
22
•   ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value (equity securities).
for available-for-sale equity securities, a charge is recorded in the statements of operations for positions that have experienced other-than-temporary impairments. for debt securities in which we do not expect full recovery of amortized cost, the security is deemed to be credit-impaired.  credit-related impairments and impairments on securities we intend to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell are recorded in the statements of operations.  it is our intention to sell all debt securities with credit impairments.
limited partnerships the primary basis for the valuation of limited partnership interests is financial statements prepared by the general partner.  because of the timing of the preparation and delivery of these financial statements, the use of the most recently available financial statements provided by the general partners generally result in a quarter delay in the inclusion of the limited partnership results in our statements of operations.  due to this delay, these financial statements do not reflect the market conditions experienced in the fourth quarter of 2016.
the majority of our limited partnership holdings are considered investment companies where the general partners record assets at fair value. these limited partnerships are recorded using the equity method of accounting. we also own some real estate limited partnerships that do not meet the criteria of an investment company. these partnerships prepare audited financial statements on a cost basis. we have elected to report these limited partnerships under the fair value option, which is based on the net asset value (nav) from our partner's capital statement reflecting the general partner's estimate of fair value for the fund's underlying assets. fair value provides consistency in the evaluation and financial reporting for these limited partnerships and limited partnerships accounted for under the equity method.
we have three types of limited partnership investments: private equity, mezzanine debt, and real estate.  nearly all of the underlying investments in our limited partnerships are valued using a source other than quoted prices in active markets. the fair value amounts for our private equity and mezzanine debt partnerships are based upon the financial statements prepared by the general partners, who use various methods to estimate fair value including the market approach, income approach, and the cost approach.  the market approach uses prices and other pertinent information from market-generated transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.  such valuation techniques often use market multiples derived from a set of comparables.  the income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future cash flows or earnings to a single discounted present value amount.  the measurement is based upon the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts.  the cost approach is derived from the amount that is currently required to replace the service capacity of an asset.  if information becomes available that would impair the cost of investments owned by the partnerships, then the general partner would adjust the investments to the net realizable value.
the fair value of investments in real estate limited partnerships is determined by the general partner based upon independent appraisals and/or internal valuations.  real estate projects under development are generally valued at cost and impairment tested by the general partner.
while we perform various procedures in review of the general partners' valuations, we rely on the general partners' financial statements as the best available information to record our share of the partnership unrealized gains and losses resulting from valuation changes.  due to the limited market for these investments, there is higher potential for variability.  we survey each of the general partners quarterly about expected significant changes (plus or minus 10% compared to previous quarter) to valuations prior to the release of the fund's quarterly and annual financial statements. based upon that information from the general partner, we consider whether additional disclosure is warranted. we analyze limited partnerships measured at fair value based upon nav to determine if the most recently available nav reflects fair value at the balance sheet date, with an adjustment being made where appropriate (change of plus or minus 5% compared to most recent nav.)
we have made no new limited partnership commitments since 2006, and the balance of limited partnership investments is expected to decline over time as additional distributions are received.
retirement benefit plans for employees our pension plans consist of a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees and an unfunded supplemental employee retirement plan ("serp") for certain members of executive and senior management. although we are the sponsor of these postretirement plans and record the funded status of these plans, the exchange reimburses us for approximately 59% of the annual benefit expense of these plans, which represents pension benefits for our employees performing claims and life insurance functions and their share of service department costs.

our pension obligation is developed from actuarial estimates.  several statistical and other factors, which attempt to anticipate future events, are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans.  key factors include assumptions about the discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets.  we review these assumptions annually and modify them considering historical experience, current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates and expected future trends.
accumulated and projected benefit obligations are expressed as the present value of future cash payments.  we discount those cash payments based upon a yield curve developed from corporate bond yield information with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits.  lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense, while higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense.  the construction of the yield curve is based upon yields of corporate bonds rated aa or equivalent quality.  target yields are developed from bonds at various maturity points and a curve is fitted to those targets.  spot rates (zero coupon bond yields) are developed from the yield curve and used to discount benefit payment amounts associated with each future year.  the present value of plan benefits is calculated by applying the spot/discount rates to projected benefit cash flows.  a single discount rate is then developed to produce the same present value.  the cash flows from the yield curve were matched against our projected benefit payments in the pension plan, which have a duration of about 19 years.  this yield curve supported the selection of a 4.24% discount rate for the projected benefit obligation at december 31, 2016 and for the 2017 pension expense.  the same methodology was used to develop the 4.57% and 4.17% discount rates used to determine the projected benefit obligation for 2015 and 2014, respectively, and the pension expense for 2016 and 2015, respectively. a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would increase pension cost in the following year by $3.8 million and would increase the pension benefit obligation by $37.0 million.
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors, including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on plan assets.  these unrecognized gains and losses are recorded in the pension plan obligation and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the statements of financial position. these amounts are systematically recognized to net periodic pension expense in future periods, with gains decreasing and losses increasing future pension expense. if actuarial net gains or losses exceed 5% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and the market-related value of plan assets, the excess is recognized through the net periodic pension expense equally over the estimated service period of the employee group, which is currently 15 years.
the expected long-term rate of return for the pension plan represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid.  the expected long-term rate of return is less susceptible to annual revisions, as there are typically no significant changes in the asset mix.  to determine the expected long-term rate of return assumption, we utilized models based upon rigorous historical analysis and forward-looking views of the financial markets based upon key factors such as historical returns for the asset class' applicable indices, the correlations of the asset classes under various market conditions and consensus views on future real economic growth and inflation.  the expected future return for each asset class is then combined by considering correlations between asset classes and the volatilities of each asset class to produce a reasonable range of asset return results within which our expected long-term rate of return assumption falls. a change of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $1.5 million impact on net pension benefit cost in the following year, of which our share would be approximately $0.6 million. based on a review of the key factors and expectations of future asset performance, we reduced the expected return on asset assumption from 7.00% to 6.75% for 2017.
we use a four year averaging method to determine the market-related value of plan assets, which is used to determine the expected return component of pension expense.  under this methodology, asset gains or losses that result from returns that differ from our long-term rate of return assumption are recognized in the market-related value of assets on a level basis over a four year period.  the market-related asset experience during 2016 that related to the actual investment return being different from that assumed during the prior year was a loss of $1.5 million. recognition of this loss will be deferred and recognized over a four year period, consistent with the market-related asset value methodology.  once factored into the market-related asset value, these experience gains and losses will be amortized over a period of 15 years, which is the remaining service period of the employee group.
estimates of fair values of the pension plan assets are obtained primarily from our trustee and custodian of our pension plan.  our level 1 category includes a money market fund that is a mutual fund for which the fair value is determined using an exchange traded price provided by the trustee and custodian.  our level 2 category includes commingled pools.  estimates of fair values for securities held by our commingled pools are obtained primarily from the trustee and custodian.  the methodologies used by the trustee and custodian that support a financial instrument level 2 classification include multiple verifiable, observable inputs including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuers spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data. there were no level 3 investments in 2016 or 2015.
24
we expect our net pension benefit costs to increase from $30.6 million in 2016 to $34.3 million in 2017 as a result of a lower discount rate and a lower assumed expected return on assets in 2017, partially offset by the mortality tables being updated with two additional years of mortality data. our share of the net pension benefit costs after reimbursements will increase from $12.7 million in 2016 to approximately $14.1 million in 2017.
the actuarial assumptions we used in determining our pension obligation may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, or longer or shorter life spans of participants.  while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. see part ii, item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 8, postretirement benefits, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report for additional details on the pension plans.

direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange direct and assumed premiums include premiums written directly by the exchange and premiums assumed from its wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries. direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange increased 6.2% to $6.3 billion in 2016, from $5.9 billion in 2015, driven by an increase in policies in force and increases in average premium per policy.  year-over-year policies in force for all lines of business increased by 3.1% in 2016 primarily as the result of continuing strong policyholder retention, compared to 3.6% in 2015.  the year-over-year average premium per policy for all lines of business increased 2.9% at december 31, 2016, compared to 3.5% at december 31, 2015.
premiums generated from new business increased 4.3% to $753 million in 2016, compared to 3.9%, or $722 million, in 2015.  underlying the trend in new business premiums was a 0.9% increase in new business policies written in 2016, compared to
25
2.3% in 2015, while the year-over-year average premium per policy on new business increased 3.4% at december 31, 2016, compared to 1.6% at december 31, 2015.
premiums generated from renewal business increased 6.4% to $5.5 billion in 2016, compared to 7.7%, or $5.2 billion, in 2015.  underlying the trend in renewal business premiums were increases in average premium per policy and steady policy retention ratios. the renewal business year-over-year average premium per policy increased 2.8% at december 31, 2016, compared to 3.8% at december 31, 2015.
the exchange implemented rate increases in 2016, 2015, and 2014 in order to meet loss cost expectations.  as the exchange writes policies with annual terms only, rate actions take 12 months to be fully recognized in written premium and 24 months to be fully recognized in earned premiums.  since rate changes are realized at renewal, it takes 12 months to implement a rate change to all policyholders and another 12 months to earn the increased or decreased premiums in full.  as a result, certain rate actions approved in 2015 were reflected in 2016, and recent rate actions in 2016 will be reflected in 2017. the exchange continuously evaluates pricing and product offerings to meet consumer demands.
personal lines - total personal lines premiums written increased 6.5% to $4.4 billion in 2016, from $4.2 billion in 2015, driven by an increase of 3.3% in total personal lines policies in force and an increase of 3.1% in the total personal lines year-over-year average premium per policy.
commercial lines - total commercial lines premiums written increased 5.4%, to $1.8 billion in 2016, compared to 2015, driven by a 2.3% increase in total commercial lines policies in force and a 3.1% increase in the total commercial lines year-over-year average premium per policy.
future trends-premium revenue - the exchange plans to continue its efforts to grow premiums and improve its competitive position in the marketplace.  expanding the size of its agency force through a careful agency selection process and increased market penetration in our existing operating territories will contribute to future growth as existing and new agents build their books of business changes in premium levels attributable to the growth in policies in force directly affects the profitability of the exchange and has a direct bearing on our management fee.  the exchange's continued focus on underwriting discipline and the maturing of our pricing sophistication models has contributed to its growth in new policies in force, steady policy retention ratios, and increased average premium per policy.  the continued growth of its policy base is dependent upon the exchange's ability to retain existing policyholders and attract new policyholders.  a lack of new policy growth or the inability to retain existing customers could have an adverse effect on the exchange's premium level growth, and consequently our management fee.
changes in premium levels attributable to rate changes also directly affect the profitability of the exchange and have a direct bearing on our management fee.  pricing actions contemplated or taken by the exchange are subject to various regulatory requirements of the states in which it operates.  the pricing actions already implemented, or to be implemented, have an effect on the market competitiveness of the exchange's insurance products.  such pricing actions, and those of the exchange's competitors, could affect the ability of the exchange's agents to retain and attract new business.  we expect the exchange's pricing actions to result in a net increase in direct written premium in 2017; however, exposure reductions and/or changes in mix of business as a result of economic conditions could impact the average premium written and assumed by the exchange, as customers may reduce coverages.
management fee rate the management fee rate was set at 25%, the maximum rate, for 2016, 2015 and 2014.  the management fee rate for 2017 was set at 25% by our board of directors.  changes in the management fee rate can affect our revenue and net income significantly.  see also, the "transactions/agreements with related parties" section within this report.
change in allowance for management fee returned on cancelled policies management fees are returned to the exchange when policyholders cancel their insurance coverage mid-term and unearned premiums are refunded to them. we maintain an allowance for management fees returned on mid-year policy cancellations that recognizes the management fee anticipated to be returned to the exchange based on historical mid-term cancellation experience. our cash flows are unaffected by the recording of this allowance.
26
service agreement revenue service agreement revenue includes service charges we collect from policyholders for providing extended payment terms on policies written and assumed by the exchange, and late payment and policy reinstatement fees.  the service charges are fixed dollar amounts per billed installment.  service agreement revenue totaled $29.2 million, $30.0 million and $30.9 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  the decrease in service agreement revenue compared to the growth in policies in force reflects the continued shift in policies to the monthly direct debit payment plan, which does not incur service charges, and the no-fee single payment plan, which offers a premium discount.  the shift to these plans is driven by the consumers' desire to avoid paying service charges and to take advantage of the discount in pricing offered for paid-in-full policies.

(1)   see part ii, item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 5, investments, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report for additional disclosures regarding net realized investment gains (losses).
net realized investment gains and losses include gains and losses resulting from the sales of our fixed maturity or equity securities.
net realized gains were $0.7 million in 2016, compared to gains of $0.5 million in 2015 and $1.1 million in 2014.  net realized gains in 2016 were primarily attributable to gains from sales of common stock trading securities. net realized gains in 2015 were due to gains from sales on nonredeemable preferred stock, which were partially offset by losses from sales of fixed maturities, while gains in 2014 were primarily attributable to gains from sales of equity securities.
net impairment losses recognized in earnings net impairment losses recognized in earnings were $0.4 million in 2016, compared to $1.6 million in 2015, and $0.1 million in 2014. net impairment losses recognized in earnings in both 2016 and 2015 were primarily due to securities in an unrealized loss position where we determined the loss was other-than-temporary based on credit factors, and also included securities in an unrealized loss position that we intended to sell prior to expected recovery to our cost basis.

limited partnership earnings pertain to investments in u.s. and foreign private equity, mezzanine debt, and real estate partnerships.  valuation adjustments are recorded to reflect the changes in fair value of the underlying investments held by the limited partnerships.  these adjustments are recorded as a component of equity in earnings of limited partnerships in the statements of operations.
limited partnership earnings tend to be cyclical based upon market conditions, the age of the partnership, and the nature of the investments.  generally, limited partnership earnings are recorded on a quarter lag from financial statements we receive from our general partners.  as a consequence, earnings from limited partnerships reported at december 31, 2016 reflect investment valuation changes resulting from the financial markets and the economy for the twelve month period ending september 30, 2016.
equity in earnings of limited partnerships decreased by $10.0 million in 2016, compared to 2015, and increased by
$6.1 million in 2015, compared to 2014. the decrease in earnings in 2016 was the result of lower earnings from private equity investments that were partially offset by higher earnings from real estate investments. the increase in earnings in 2015 was due to higher earnings from private equity investments that were partially offset by lower earnings from real estate investments.
financial condition of erie insurance exchange serving in the capacity of attorney-in-fact for the exchange, we are dependent on the growth and financial condition of the exchange, who is our sole customer. the strength of the exchange and its wholly owned subsidiaries is rated annually by a.m. best company. higher ratings of insurance companies generally indicate financial stability and a strong ability to pay claims. the ratings are generally based upon factors relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward return to investors. the exchange and each of its property and casualty subsidiaries are rated a+ "superior". the outlook for the financial strength rating is stable. according to a.m. best, this second highest financial strength rating category is assigned to those companies that, in a.m. best's opinion, have achieved superior overall performance when compared to the standards established by a.m. best and have a superior ability to meet obligations to policyholders over the long term. only approximately 11% of insurance groups are rated a+ or higher, and the exchange is included in that group.
the financial statements of the exchange are prepared in accordance with statutory accounting principles prescribed by the commonwealth of pennsylvania. financial statements prepared under statutory accounting principles focus on the solvency of the insurer and generally provide a more conservative approach than under gaap. statutory direct written premiums of the exchange and its wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries grew 6.2% to $6.3 billion in 2016 from $5.9 billion in 2015. these premiums, along with investment income, are the major sources of cash that support the operations of the exchange. policyholders' surplus, determined under statutory accounting principles, was $7.7 billion and $7.1 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the exchange and its wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries' year-over-year policy retention ratio continues to be high at 89.8% at december 31, 2016 and 89.9% at december 31, 2015.
financial condition investments our investment portfolio is managed with the objective of maximizing after-tax returns on a risk-adjusted basis.

we continually review our investment portfolio to evaluate positions that might incur other-than-temporary declines in value.  we record impairment write-downs on investments in instances where the fair value of the investment is substantially below cost, and we conclude that the decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, which includes consideration for intent to sell.
for all investment holdings, general economic conditions and/or conditions specifically affecting the underlying issuer or its industry, including downgrades by the major rating agencies, are considered in evaluating impairment in value.  in addition to specific factors, other factors considered in our review of investment valuation are the length of time the fair value is below cost and the amount the fair value is below cost.
we individually analyze all positions with emphasis on those that have, in our opinion, declined significantly below cost.  in compliance with impairment guidance for debt securities, we perform further analysis to determine if a credit-related impairment has occurred.  some of the factors considered in determining whether a debt security is credit impaired include potential for the default of interest and/or principal, level of subordination, collateral of the issue, compliance with financial covenants, credit ratings and industry conditions.  we have the intent to sell all credit-impaired debt securities; therefore, the entire amount of the impairment charges are included in earnings and no impairments are recorded in other comprehensive income.  for available-for-sale equity securities, a charge is recorded in the statements of operations for positions that have experienced other-than-temporary impairments.  (see the "results of operations" section herein for further information.)  we believe our investment valuation philosophy and accounting practices result in appropriate and timely measurement of value and recognition of impairment.
fixed maturities under our investment strategy, we maintain a fixed maturity portfolio that is of high quality and well diversified within each market sector.  this investment strategy also achieves a balanced maturity schedule.  our fixed maturity portfolio is managed with the goal of achieving reasonable returns while limiting exposure to risk.  our municipal bond portfolio accounts for
$253.1 million, or 36%, of the total fixed maturity portfolio at december 31, 2016.  the overall credit rating of the municipal portfolio without consideration of the underlying insurance is aa.
fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, included in shareholders' equity.  net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, net of deferred taxes, amounted to $3.2 million at december 31, 2016, compared to $3.4 million at december 31, 2015.

common stock equity securities classified as available-for-sale include certain exchange traded funds with underlying holdings of fixed maturity securities. these securities meet the criteria of a common stock under u.s. gaap, and are included on the statements of financial position as available-for-sale equity securities. these investments are carried at fair value of $5.9 million at december 31, 2016 and $12.7 million at december 31, 2015, with all changes in unrealized gains and losses reflected in other comprehensive income.  the net unrealized loss on these securities, net of deferred taxes, was $0.1 million at december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015.
limited partnerships in 2016, investments in limited partnerships decreased from the investment levels at december 31, 2015.  changes in partnership values are a function of contributions and distributions, adjusted for market value changes in the underlying investments. the decrease in limited partnership investments was due to net distributions received from the partnerships which were partially offset by increases in underlying asset values. we have made no new limited partnership commitments since 2006, and the balance of limited partnership investments is expected to decline over time as additional distributions are received. the results from our limited partnerships are based upon financial statements received from our general partners, which are generally received on a quarter lag. as a result, the market values and earnings recorded at december 31, 2016 reflect the partnership activity experienced during the twelve month period ending september 30, 2016.
shareholders' equity postretirement benefit plans the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans is recognized in the statements of financial position, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. at december 31, 2016, shareholders' equity amounts related to these postretirement plans decreased by $24.6 million, net of tax, of which $5.5 million represents amortization of the prior service cost and net actuarial loss and $30.1 million represents the current period actuarial loss.  the 2016 actuarial loss was primarily due to the change in the discount rate assumption used to measure the future benefit obligations to 4.24% in 2016, from 4.57% in 2015. at december 31, 2015, shareholders' equity amounts related to these postretirement plans increased by $25.1 million, net of tax, of which $9.4 million represents amortization of the prior service cost and net actuarial loss and $15.7 million represents the current period actuarial gain.  the 2015 actuarial gain was primarily due to the change in the discount rate assumption used to measure the future benefit obligations to 4.57% in 2015, from 4.17% in 2014. although we are the sponsor of these postretirement plans and record the funded status of these plans, the exchange reimburses us for approximately 59% of the annual benefit expense of these plans, which represents pension benefits for our employees performing claims and life insurance functions and their share of service department costs.
home office expansion on november 7, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement for a $100 million senior secured draw term loan credit facility ("credit facility") for the acquisition of real property and construction of an office building that will serve as part of our principal headquarters. as of december 31, 2016, we have drawn $25 million against the facility. under the agreement, an additional $75 million will be drawn over the next two years ("draw period"). during the draw period, we will make monthly interest only payments under the credit facility and thereafter the credit facility converts to a fully-amortized term loan with monthly payments of principal and interest over a period of 28 years. borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.35%. in addition, we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee of 0.08% on the unused portion of the credit facility during the draw period. we will capitalize applicable interest charges incurred during the construction period of long-term building projects as part of the historical cost of the asset.
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash liquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short- and long-term cash requirements of its business operations and growth needs.  our liquidity requirements have been met primarily by funds generated from management fee revenue and income from investments.  cash provided from these sources is used primarily to fund the costs of our management operations including commissions, salaries and wages, pension plans, share repurchases, dividends to shareholders, and the purchase and development of information technology.  we expect that our operating cash needs will be met by funds generated from operations.
volatility in the financial markets presents challenges to us as we do occasionally access our investment portfolio as a source of cash.  some of our fixed income investments, despite being publicly traded, are illiquid.  volatility in these markets could impair our ability to sell certain of our fixed income securities or cause such securities to sell at deep discounts.  additionally,
31
our limited partnership investments are significantly less liquid.  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our needs from other sources even if market volatility persists throughout 2017.
cash flow activities the following table provides condensed cash flow information for the years ended december 31:

net cash provided by operating activities increased to $254.3 million in 2016, compared to $217.4 million in 2015, and $186.0 million in 2014.  increased cash from operating activities in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in management fee revenue received, reflecting the increase in direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange, combined with lower general operating expenses paid. somewhat offsetting this increase in cash provided was an increase in commissions and bonuses paid to agents combined with a decrease in reimbursements collected from affiliates, compared to 2015. cash paid for agent commissions and bonuses increased to $870.6 million in 2016, compared to $822.5 million in 2015, as a result of an increase in cash paid for scheduled commissions due to premium growth and bonus awards due to profitable underwriting results.  we contributed $17.4 million to our pension plan in 2016, compared to $17.0 million in 2015. additionally, we made a contribution to our pension plan for $19.0 million in january 2017.  our funding policy is generally to contribute an amount equal to the greater of the target normal cost for the plan year or the amount necessary to fund the plan to 100% plus interest to the date the contribution is made.  we are reimbursed approximately 59% of the net periodic benefit cost of the pension plans from the exchange, which represents pension benefits for our employees performing claims and life insurance functions and their share of service department costs.  in 2015, increased cash from operating activities, compared to 2014, was primarily due to increases in management fee revenue received and reimbursements collected from affiliates, combined with a decrease in pension and employee benefits paid. somewhat offsetting this increase in cash provided were increases in commissions and bonuses paid to agents, and general operating expenses and income taxes paid, compared to 2014.
at december 31, 2016, we recorded a net deferred tax asset of $53.9 million. there was no deferred tax valuation allowance recorded at december 31, 2016.
net cash used in investing activities totaled $136.9 million in 2016 compared to cash provided of $0.6 million in 2015 and cash used of $5.1 million in 2014. increases in purchases of available-for-sale securities and fixed assets, coupled with lower cash generated from the return of capital from limited partnerships, contributed to cash used in 2016, compared to cash provided in 2015. somewhat offsetting the cash used in 2016 was an increase in cash generated from the sale and maturity of available-for-sale securities, compared to 2015.  also impacting our future investing activities are limited partnership commitments, which totaled $16.9 million at december 31, 2016, and will be funded as required by the partnerships' agreements.  of this amount, the total remaining commitment to fund limited partnerships that invest in private equity securities was $6.8 million, mezzanine debt securities was $8.2 million, and real estate activities was $1.9 million.  while cash generated from the sale of available-for-sale securities was lower in 2015, compared to 2014, decreases in purchases of available-for-sale securities and fixed assets contributed to net cash being generated for 2015.
net cash used in financing activities totaled $111.2 million in 2016, $126.9 million in 2015, and $138.2 million in 2014.  the decrease in cash used in 2016 was due to borrowings on the new senior secured draw term loan credit facility, somewhat offset by an increase in cash paid for dividends to shareholders, compared to 2015. future financing activities will reflect the draw requirements under the new senior secured draw term loan credit facility, which will increase the cash provided by financing activities by $50 million in 2017 and $25 million in 2018, while principal payments will not commence until 2019. dividends paid to shareholders totaled $136.0 million, $126.9 million, and $118.5 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we increased both our class a and class b shareholder regular quarterly dividends by 7.2% for 2016 and 2015.  dividends have been approved at a 7.2% increase for 2017.
no shares of our class a nonvoting common stock were repurchased in 2016 and 2015 in conjunction with our stock repurchase program. in 2014, shares repurchased under this program totaled 276,390 at a total cost of $19.5 million, based upon settlement date.  in october 2011, our board of directors approved a continuation of the current stock repurchase program for a total of $150 million with no time limitation.  this repurchase authority includes, and is not in addition to, any unspent amounts remaining under the prior authorization.  we had approximately $17.8 million of repurchase authority remaining under this program at december 31, 2016, based upon trade date.

in 2016, we purchased 15,093 shares of our outstanding class a nonvoting common stock outside of our publicly announced share repurchase program at a total cost of $1.5 million for the vesting of stock-based awards in conjunction with our long-term incentive plan, and for the rabbi trust outside director deferred compensation plan. these shares were delivered in 2016. in 2015, we purchased 111,535 shares of our outstanding class a nonvoting common stock outside of our publicly announced share repurchase program at a total cost of $10.4 million for the vesting of stock-based awards in conjunction with our long-term incentive plan, for stock-based awards for executive management and an outside director, and for the rabbi trust outside director deferred compensation plan. these shares were delivered in 2015. in 2014, we purchased 64,398 shares of our outstanding class a nonvoting common stock outside of our publicly announced share repurchase program at a total cost of $4.9 million for the vesting of stock-based awards for executive management and an outside director, and for awards under our long-term incentive plan.  these shares were delivered in 2014.
capital outlook we regularly prepare forecasts evaluating the current and future cash requirements for both normal and extreme risk events.  should an extreme risk event result in a cash requirement exceeding normal cash flows, we have the ability to meet our future funding requirements through various alternatives available to us.
outside of our normal operating and investing cash activities, future funding requirements could be met through:
1) cash and cash equivalents, which total approximately $189.1 million at december 31, 2016, 2) a $100 million bank revolving line of credit, and 3) liquidation of assets held in our investment portfolio, including common stock and investment grade bonds which totaled approximately $342.0 million at december 31, 2016.  volatility in the financial markets could impair our ability to sell certain of our fixed income securities or cause such securities to sell at deep discounts.  additionally, we have the ability to curtail or modify discretionary cash outlays such as those related to shareholder dividends and share repurchase activities.
as of december 31, 2016, we have access to a $100 million bank revolving line of credit with a $25 million letter of credit sublimit that expires on november 3, 2020. as of december 31, 2016, a total of $99.0 million remains available under the facility due to $1.0 million outstanding letters of credit, which reduce the availability for letters of credit to $24.0 million.  we had no borrowings outstanding on our line of credit as of december 31, 2016. bonds with a fair value of $110.3 million were pledged as collateral on the line at december 31, 2016. these securities have no trading restrictions and are reported as available-for-sale securities in the statements of financial position.  the bank requires compliance with certain covenants, which include leverage ratios and debt restrictions, for our line of credit.  we were in compliance with our bank covenants at december 31, 2016.

(1)   long-term debt amount differs from the balance presented on the statements of financial position as the long-term debt amount in the table above includes interest and principal payments based upon total expected draw commitments and excludes commitment fees.
(2)   limited partnership commitments will be funded as required for capital contributions at any time prior to the agreement expiration date. the commitment amounts are presented using the expiration date as the factor by which to age when the amounts are due. at december 31, 2016, our total commitment to fund limited partnerships that invest in private equity securities was $6.8 million, mezzanine debt was $8.2 million, and real estate activities was $1.9 million.
(3)   the pension contribution for 2017 was estimated in accordance with the pension protection act of 2006. contributions anticipated in future years depend upon certain factors that cannot be reasonably predicted. any contributions required in future years will be an amount equal to the greater of the target normal cost for the plan year or the amount necessary to fund the plan to 100% plus interest to the date the contribution is made. the obligations for our unfunded benefit plans, including the supplemental employee retirement plan (serp) for our executive and senior management, are not included in gross contractual obligations. the recorded accumulated benefit obligation for this plan at december 31, 2016 is $14.4 million. we expect to have sufficient cash flows from operations to meet the future benefit payments as these become due.
(4)   other commitments include various agreements for services, including computer software, telephones, copiers, and maintenance.
(5)   operating leases - real estate are for 18 of our 25 field offices and two operating leases are for office space and a warehouse facility.
(6)   we are reimbursed from the exchange for a portion of the costs related to the pension, other commitments and operating leases.
balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements include those with unconsolidated entities that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or results of operations, including material variable interests in unconsolidated entities that conduct certain activities.  we have no material off-balance sheet obligations or guarantees, other than the unused portion of the senior secured draw term loan credit facility and limited partnership investment commitments. see the preceding contractual obligations section for further discussion of these commitments.
enterprise risk management the role of our enterprise risk management ("erm") function is to ensure that all significant risks are clearly identified, understood, proactively managed and consistently monitored to achieve strategic objectives for all stakeholders. our erm program views risk holistically across our entire group of companies. it ensures implementation of risk responses to mitigate potential impacts. see item 1a "risk factors" contained in this report for a list of risk factors.
our erm process is founded on a governance framework that includes oversight at multiple levels of our organization, including our board of directors and executive management. accountability to identify, manage, and mitigate risk is embedded within all functions and areas of our business. we have defined risk tolerances to monitor and manage significant risks within acceptable levels. in addition to identifying, evaluating, prioritizing, monitoring, and mitigating significant risks, our erm process includes extreme event analyses and scenario testing. given our defined tolerance for risk, risk model output is used to quantify the potential variability of future performance and the sufficiency of capital and liquidity levels.

transactions/agreements with related parties board oversight our board of directors has a broad oversight responsibility over our intercompany relationships with the exchange.  as a consequence, our board of directors may be required to make decisions or take actions that may not be solely in the interest of our shareholders, such as setting the management fee rate paid by the exchange to us and ratifying any other significant intercompany activity.
subscriber's agreement we serve as attorney-in-fact for the policyholders at the exchange, a reciprocal insurance exchange.  each applicant for insurance to a reciprocal insurance exchange signs a subscriber's agreement that contains an appointment of an attorney-in-fact.  through the designation of attorney-in-fact, we are required to provide certain sales, underwriting, and policy issuance services to the policyholders of the exchange, as discussed previously.  pursuant to the subscriber's agreement, we earn a management fee for these services calculated as a percentage of the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange.
insurance holding company system most states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems, defined as two or more affiliated persons, one or more of which is an insurer. the exchange has the following wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries: erie insurance company, erie insurance company of new york, erie insurance property and casualty company and flagship city insurance company, and a wholly owned life insurance company, erie family life insurance company ("efl"). indemnity and the exchange, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, meet the definition of an insurance holding company system.
intercompany agreements service agreements we make certain payments for claims and life insurance related costs, investment management services, common overhead expenses and certain service department costs incurred by us on behalf of the exchange and its wholly owned subsidiaries.  by virtue of its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the exchange does not have the ability to enter into contractual relationships and therefore indemnity serves as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the exchange for all claims handling services, investment management services, and certain other common overhead and service department functions in accordance with the subscriber's agreement. these amounts are reimbursed to us based upon appropriate utilization statistics (employee count, square footage, vehicle count, project hours, etc.) in accordance with the subscriber's agreement and the service agreements between us and the exchange's wholly owned subsidiaries.  all reimbursements are made on an actual cost basis and do not include a profit component. these reimbursements are settled on a monthly basis.
leased property we lease certain office space from the exchange including the home office and three field office facilities. we also have a lease commitment with efl for a field office. rents are determined considering returns on invested capital and building operating and overhead costs. rental costs of shared facilities are allocated based upon usage or square footage occupied.
cost allocation the allocation of costs affects the financial condition of us and the exchange and its wholly owned subsidiaries. management's role is to determine that allocations are consistently made in accordance with the subscriber's agreements with the policyholders at the exchange, intercompany service agreements, and applicable insurance laws and regulations.  allocation of costs under these various agreements requires judgment and interpretation, and such allocations are performed using a consistent methodology, which is intended to adhere to the terms and intentions of the underlying agreements.

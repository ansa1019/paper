item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with "cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements" and our combined consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k.
non-u.s. gaap financial measures total segment earnings before interest and taxes ("ebit") is an operating performance measure used by bunge's management to evaluate segment operating activities. bunge's management believes total segment ebit is a useful measure of operating profitability, since the measure allows for an evaluation of the performance of its segments without regard to its financing methods or capital structure. in addition, ebit is a financial measure that is widely used by analysts and investors in bunge's industries. total segment ebit is a non-u.s. gaap financial measure and is not intended to replace net income attributable to bunge, the most directly comparable u.s. gaap financial measure.
operating results factors affecting operating results bunge limited, a bermuda company, together with its subsidiaries, is a leading global agribusiness and food company operating in the farm-to-consumer food chain. the commodity nature of the company's principal products, as well as regional and global supply and demand variations that occur as an inherent part of the business make volumes an important operating measure. accordingly,

information is included in "segment results" that summarizes certain items in our consolidated statements of income and volumes by reportable segment. the common unit of measure for all reported volumes is metric tons. a description of reported volumes for each reportable segment has also been included in the discussion of key factors affecting results of operations in each of our business segments as discussed below.
agribusiness in the agribusiness segment, we purchase, store, transport, process and sell agricultural commodities and commodity products. profitability in this segment is affected by the availability and market prices of agricultural commodities and processed commodity products and the availability and costs of energy, transportation and logistics services. profitability in our oilseed processing operations is also impacted by volumes procured, processed and sold and by capacity utilization rates. availability of agricultural commodities is affected by many factors, including weather, farmer planting and selling decisions, plant diseases, governmental policies and agricultural sector economic conditions. reported volumes in this segment primarily reflect (i) grains and oilseeds originated from farmers, cooperatives or other aggregators and from which "origination margins" are earned; (ii) oilseeds processed in our oilseed processing facilities and from which "crushing margins" are earnedrepresenting the margin from the industrial separation of the oilseed into its protein meal and vegetable oil components, both of which are separate commodity products; and (iii) third party sales of grains, oilseeds and related commodity products merchandised through our distribution businesses and from which "distribution margins" are earned. the foregoing sub-segment volumes may overlap as they produce separate margin capture opportunities. for example, oilseeds procured in our south american grain origination activities may be processed in our oilseed processing facilities in asia-pacific and will be reflected at both points within the segment. as such, these reported volumes do not represent solely volumes of net sales to third-parties, but rather where margin is earned, appropriately reflecting their contribution to our global network's capacity utilization and profitability.
demand for our purchased and processed agribusiness products is affected by many factors, including global and regional economic conditions, changes in per capita incomes, the financial condition of customers and customer access to credit, worldwide consumption of food products, particularly pork and poultry, population growth rates, relative prices of substitute agricultural products, outbreaks of disease associated with livestock and poultry, and demand for renewable fuels produced from agricultural commodities and commodity products.
we expect that the factors described above will continue to affect global supply and demand for our agribusiness products for the foreseeable future. we also expect that, from time to time, imbalances will likely exist between oilseed processing capacity and demand for oilseed products in certain regions, which impacts our decisions regarding whether, when and where to purchase, store, transport, process or sell these commodities, including whether to change the location of or adjust our own oilseed processing capacity.
additionally, price fluctuations and availability of commodities may cause fluctuations in our working capital, such as inventories, accounts receivable and borrowings over the course of a given year. for example, increased availability of commodities at harvest times often causes fluctuations in our inventories and borrowings. increases in agricultural commodity prices will also generally cause our cash flow requirements to increase as our operations require increased use of cash to acquire inventories and fund daily settlement requirements on exchange traded futures that we use to hedge our physical inventories.
34
food and ingredients in the food and ingredients business, which consists of our edible oil products and milling products segments, our operating results are affected by changes in the prices of raw materials, such as crude vegetable oils and grains, the mix of products that we sell, changes in consumer eating habits, changes in per capita incomes, consumer purchasing power levels, availability of credit to customers, governmental dietary guidelines and policies, changes in regional economic conditions and the general competitive environment in our markets. raw material inputs to our production processes in the edible oil products and milling products segments are largely sourced at market prices from our agribusiness segment. reported volumes in these segments reflect third-party sales of our finished products and, as such, include the sales of products derived from raw materials sourced from the agribusiness segment as well as from third-parties. the unit of measure for these volumes is metric tons as these businesses are linked to the commodity raw materials, which are their primary inputs.
sugar and bioenergy the sugar and bioenergy segment is an integrated business which primarily includes the procurement and growing of sugarcane and the production of sugar, ethanol and electricity in our eight mills in brazil, global sugar trading and merchandising activities and investment interests in affiliates.
profitability in this segment is affected by the availability and quality of sugarcane, which impacts our capacity utilization rates and the amount of sugar that can be extracted from the sugarcane, and by market prices of sugarcane, sugar and ethanol. availability and quality of sugarcane is affected by many factors, including weather, geographical factors such as soil quality and topography, and agricultural practices. once planted, sugarcane may be harvested for several continuous years, but the yield decreases with each subsequent harvest. as a result, the current optimum economic cycle is generally five or six consecutive harvests, depending on location. we own and/or have partnership agreements to manage farmland on which we grow and harvest sugarcane. we also purchase sugarcane from third parties. prices of sugarcane in brazil are established by consecana, the são paulo state sugarcane, sugar and ethanol council, and are based on the sucrose content of the cane and the market prices of sugar and ethanol. demand for our products is affected by such factors as changes in global or regional economic conditions, the financial condition of customers and customer access to credit, worldwide consumption of food products, population growth rates, changes in per capita incomes and demand for and governmental support of renewable fuels produced from agricultural commodities, including sugarcane. we expect that these factors will continue to affect supply and demand for our sugar and bioenergy products in the foreseeable future. reported volumes in this segment reflect third-party sales of sugar and ethanol.
fertilizer in the fertilizer segment, demand for our products is affected by the profitability of the agricultural sectors we serve, the availability of credit to farmers, agricultural commodity prices, the types of crops planted, the number of acres planted, the quality of the land under cultivation and weather-related issues affecting the success of the harvests. our profitability is impacted by international selling prices for fertilizers and fertilizer raw materials, such as phosphate, sulfur, ammonia and urea, ocean freight rates and other import costs, as well as import volumes at the port facilities we manage. as our operations are in south america, primarily argentina, our results in this segment are typically seasonal, with fertilizer sales normally concentrated in the third and fourth quarters of the year due to the timing of the south american agricultural cycle. reported volumes in this segment reflect third-party sales of our finished products.
35
in addition to these industry related factors which impact our business areas, our results of operations in all business areas and segments are affected by the following factors:
foreign currency exchange rates due to the global nature of our operations, our operating results can be materially impacted by foreign currency exchange rates. both translation of our foreign subsidiaries' financial statements and foreign currency transactions can affect our results. on a monthly basis, for subsidiaries whose functional currency is their local currency, subsidiary statements of income and cash flows must be translated into u.s. dollars for consolidation purposes based on weighted-average exchange rates in each monthly period. as a result, fluctuations of local currencies compared to the u.s. dollar during each monthly period impact our consolidated statements of income and cash flows for each reported period (quarter and year-to-date) and also affect comparisons between those reported periods. subsidiary balance sheets are translated using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date with the resulting translation adjustments reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). included in accumulated other comprehensive income for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were foreign exchange net translation gains (losses) of $709 million, $(2,546) million, and $(1,411) million, respectively, resulting from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities.
additionally, we record transaction gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity. these amounts are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates as of the balance sheet date, with the resulting gains or losses included in the entity's statement of income and, therefore, in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange gains (losses).
we primarily use a combination of equity and intercompany loans to finance our subsidiaries. intercompany loans that are of a long-term investment nature with no intention of repayment in the foreseeable future are considered permanently invested and as such are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes. as a result, any foreign exchange translation gains or losses on such permanently invested intercompany loans are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets. in contrast, foreign exchange translation gains or losses on intercompany loans that are not of a permanent nature are recorded in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange gains (losses).
income taxes as a bermuda exempted company, we are not subject to income taxes on income in our jurisdiction of incorporation. however, our subsidiaries, which operate in multiple tax jurisdictions, are subject to income taxes at various statutory rates ranging from 0% to 39%. the jurisdictions that significantly impact our effective tax rate are brazil, the united states, argentina and bermuda. determination of taxable income requires the interpretation of related and often complex tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction where we operate and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future events.
results of operations
2016 overview net income attributable to bunge for 2016 decreased by $46 million to $745 million compared to $791 million for 2015. this decrease in net income was driven by a decline in total segment ebit of $105 million, as discussed below, and lower results in discontinued operations of $44 million is primarily due to the impact of cumulative translation adjustments, partially offset by lower income tax expense of $76 million and lower net interest costs of $32 million. income tax expense in 2016 included
36
net tax benefits of $34 million that resulted primarily from refund claims in north america and the release of deferred income tax valuation allowances in brazil, partially offset by unrecognized tax benefits in asia-pacific. interest expense in 2016 included a $26 million reversal of interest recorded in previous years.
total segment ebit of $1,143 million in 2016 decreased from $1,248 million in 2015. ebit for 2016 included $120 million of gains on the disposition of equity interests of port and transshipment operations in brazil and oilseed crush operations in vietnam and a $14 million gain related to a wheat export tax contingency settlement in brazil. in addition, 2016 ebit included impairment charges of $44 million and $15 million of equity investments in brazil and asia-pacific, respectively, impairment charges of $12 million of intangible assets, $9 million of asset impairment charges in our fertilizer operations in argentina, an $8 million provision for long-term receivables in brazil and $3 million of restructuring charges in our industrial sugar operations in brazil. ebit for 2015 includes a $47 million gain on the sale of certain grain assets in canada to g3 canada limited (formerly the canadian wheat board) and a $30 million reversal of an export tax contingency in argentina. in addition 2015 ebit includes a $13 million goodwill impairment charge in our brazilian tomato products business, impairment charges in our equity method investment in a freight shipping company of $14 million and a $15 million impairment charge as a result of the announced closure of a packaged oil plant in the united states, as well as a $9 million charge for administrative tax assessment fees related to export activities in our argentine subsidiary.
agribusiness segment ebit of $875 million for 2016 was $233 million lower compared to $1,108 million in 2015. the primary drivers of this decrease included weaker crush margins in our soy processing operations and lower grain origination results in brazil due to weaker farmer selling compared to a strong performance in 2015. in addition, our risk management activities contributed to a lesser extent to our results in 2016 as compared to 2015. foreign exchange results were losses of $7 million in 2016 as compared to gains of $67 million in 2015. the decrease in ebit in 2016 was partly offset by a reduction of sg&a expenses and improved results in certain of our non-consolidated equity investments in brazil and asia.
edible oil products segment ebit was $112 million in 2016 compared to $59 million in 2015. gross profit increased $35 million driven by higher volumes and stronger margins. in brazil, results improved due to higher market share for packaged oils products, in canada demand for refined oil showed strong growth, and in india, both volumes and margins improved. gross profit was adversely impacted by weaker results in our margarines business in europe. sg&a expense was lower in the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period a year ago, driven by cost-cutting and efficiency initiatives. in 2015, results included impairment charges related to goodwill in our brazil tomato products business and the closure of an oil packaging facility in the united states.
milling products segment ebit increased by $28 million to $131 million in 2016 from $103 million in 2015, primarily driven by higher volumes and margins in brazil and the contribution to results by moinho pacifico, a wheat mill in brazil, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015. gross profit in mexico was lower resulting from reduced volumes. in 2016, we recovered $14 million of wheat import taxes in brazil that we have paid in prior years.
sugar and bioenergy segment ebit in 2016 was a loss of $4 million compared to a loss of $27 million in 2015. the improved results were primarily driven by higher sugar and brazilian ethanol prices, operational improvements in our industrial operations and foreign exchange gains, partly offset by lower volumes and increased local currency costs in brazil driven by inflation. in 2016, we recorded $44 million of impairment charges in our equity method investment for the development and production of value added oils and feed ingredients in brazil, $8 million to provision for certain long-term receivables in brazil and $3 million for restructuring charges in our sugar milling business.
37
fertilizer segment ebit increased to $29 million in 2016 compared to $5 million in 2015. in 2016 gross profit increased as a result of higher volumes and margins in argentina, as demand from farmers increased due to larger crop areas. in addition, in 2016 we recorded the reversal of a natural gas tariff contingency from prior years totaling $11 million. results in 2015 were impacted due to a strike in one of our plants.
segment results bunge has five reportable segmentsagribusiness, edible oil products, milling products, sugar and bioenergy and fertilizerwhich are organized based upon similar economic characteristics and are similar in nature of products and services offered, the nature of production processes, the type and class of customer and distribution methods. the agribusiness segment is characterized by both inputs and outputs being agricultural commodities and thus high volume and low margin. the edible oil products segment involves the manufacturing and marketing of products derived from vegetable oils. the milling products segment involves the manufacturing and marketing of products derived primarily from wheat and corn. the sugar and bioenergy segment involves sugarcane growing and milling in brazil, sugar and ethanol trading and merchandising in various countries, as well as sugarcane-based ethanol production and corn-based ethanol investments and related activities. the fertilizer segment includes the activities of our port operations in brazil and argentina and blending and distribution operations in argentina.

we refer to our earnings before interest and taxes as "segment ebit". total segment ebit is an operating performance measure used by bunge's management to evaluate its segments' operating activities. total segment ebit is a non-u.s. gaap financial measure and is not intended to replace net income attributable to bunge, the most directly comparable u.s. gaap financial measure. bunge's management believes segment ebit is a useful measure of its segments' operating profitability, since the measure allows for an evaluation of the performance of its segments without regard to its financing methods or capital structure. in addition, ebit is a financial measure that is widely used by analysts and investors in bunge's industries. total segment ebit is not a measure of consolidated operating results under u.s. gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to bunge or any other measure of consolidated operating results under u.s. gaap.
a reconciliation of net income attributable to bunge to total segment ebit follows:

2016 compared to 2015
net income attributable to bungefor the year ended december 31, 2016, net income attributable to bunge of $745 million represents a decrease of $46 million from $791 million in 2015. this decline resulted primarily from a decrease in total segment ebit of $105 million and reduced income from discontinued operations of $44 million, partially offset by lower income tax expenses of $76 million, lower net interest expense of $24 million and higher interest income of $8 million. agribusiness segment ebit decreased by $233 million primarily due to lower gross profit driven by weaker results in our oilseed processing and grain origination businesses, trading and distribution activities and risk management contributions that were lower than the same period last year, partially offset by lower industrial and sg&a expenses. results in 2016 benefitted from $120 million of gains on the disposition of equity interests of port and transshipment operations in brazil and an oilseed crush facility in vietnam and 2015 results included a $47 million gain on the sale of grain assets in canada. the agribusiness segment ebit decline was partially offset by an increase in ebit across all other segments. edible oil products segment ebit improved $53 million primarily due to improved results in brazil and lower sg&a expense. milling products segment ebit improved $28 million primarily driven by increased gross profit in brazil from stronger demand for flour in the food service industry, the contribution to results from a wheat mill acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015 and a recovery of $14 million in brazilian wheat import taxes paid in prior years. sugar and bioenergy segment ebit improved $23 million primarily due to foreign exchange gains, partly offset by restructuring and
40
impairment charges. fertilizer segment ebit improved $24 million primarily due to increased gross profit because of higher fertilizer sales in argentina driven by higher fertilizer usage by farmers and the reversal of a gas tariff contingency from prior years totaling $11 million. income tax expense decreased $76 million due to the effect of reduced taxable income and a lower effective tax rate in 2016 primarily due to geographical earnings mix and the net positive impact of certain income tax benefits and charges. interest expense included the $26 million reversal of interest recorded in previous years in brazil and argentina. discontinued operations results declined $44 million primarily driven by the translation impact of a stronger brazilian  real relative to the u.s. dollar in 2016.
income tax expensein the year ended december 31, 2016, income tax expense was $220 million compared to $296 million in 2015. the effective tax rate in 2016 was 22% compared to 28% in 2015. the lower effective tax rate in 2016 was primarily due to the favorable impact of refund claims in north america and europe, along with favorable geographical earnings mix.
agribusiness segmentagribusiness segment net sales decreased 4% to $30.1 billion in 2016 compared to $31.3 billion in 2015, with volumes being essentially flat. volumes were lower in brazil driven by reduced farmer selling and a reduced corn crop due to drought. in asia, volumes were lower in our oilseed processing businesses driven by weaker margins and in our trading and distribution businesses. these decreases were partially offset by higher volumes in grain origination in north america and europe, which benefitted from larger crops and in argentina as a result of normalized commercialization following the elimination on grain export taxes and the devaluation of the argentine peso in december 2015.
cost of goods sold decreased by 3% to $28.6 billion in 2016, compared with $29.4 billion last year in line with the reductions in net sales noted above. in addition, lower industrial costs due to the relative weakening of most currencies to the u.s. dollar and certain insurance recovery benefits contributed to lower cost of goods sold in the year ended december 31, 2016 when compared to the same period last year.
gross profit decreased 20% to $1,490 million, from $1,858 million in 2015, primarily driven by lower results in oilseed processing and grain origination and to a lesser extent in our trading and distribution businesses. in oilseeds, soy processing results in the united states, brazil and europe declined from a strong performance in 2015 due to lower crush margins. in grain origination, gross profit in brazil significantly declined from strong performances in the same period last year, primarily due to slower farmer selling and lower margins. in trading and distribution, results declined primarily due to lower contribution from our risk management activities.
sg&a expenses were $706 million in 2016 compared to $851 million in 2015. this reduction was primarily driven by a reduction in headcount, cost-cutting initiatives, lower bad debt expenses and the result of the conversion of local currency costs into u.s. dollars as a result of the weakening of most global currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, with exception of the brazilian real, which appreciated in 2016.
foreign exchange results in 2016 were a loss of $7 million, compared to gains of $67 million in 2015. these results were related primarily to results on certain currency hedges and the movements in the brazilian real and argentine peso.
gains on the disposition of grain and oilseed assets were $120 million in 2016. the disposition of a 50% ownership interest in our terfron port and transshipment terminal in brazil to amaggi exportaçao e importaçao ltda. ("amaggi") resulted in a $92 million gain and $2 million related losses recorded in foreign exchange results. additionally, the disposition of a 45% interest in our vietnam crush operations to wilmar international limited ("wilmar") resulted in a gain of $30 million. in 2015, a gain of $47 million was recorded on the sale of canadian grain assets to g3 canada limited (formerly the canadian wheat board).
41
other income (expense)-net was income of $24 million and expense of $3 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. the improvement in other income (expense)-net was primarily due to improvements in the results of certain non-consolidated equity investments; mostly in our logistics joint ventures in brazil and in pt bumiraya investindo ("bri"), our palm oil plantation joint venture in indonesia.
impairment and restructuring charges of $27 million in 2016 included an impairment charge of $15 million for bri and $12 million for intangible assets related to aquaculture and other related patents.
noncontrolling interests represent (income) loss attributed to the noncontrolling interest holders in joint venture operations that are consolidated in our financial statements. noncontrolling interests generated income of $21 million in 2016 compared to income of $9 million in 2015. the increased 2016 income was primarily driven by our oilseed processing activities in asia-pacific and europe partially offset by the deconsolidation of a brazilian grain terminal, which reported income in 2015.
segment ebit decreased to $875 million in 2016 from $1,108 million in 2015, primarily driven by lower gross profit due to weaker crush margins that drove reduced soy processing results in the united states, brazil and spain, weaker softseed processing results in europe, lower grain origination results in brazil due to weaker farmer selling compared to a strong performance in 2015, and lower contributions from risk management. foreign exchange results reduced segment ebit by $74 million. the decrease was partially offset by $120 million pre-tax gains on the disposition of equity interests in brazil and vietnam and lower sg&a expenses. in 2015, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $47 million on the sale of certain grain assets in canada.
edible oil products segmentedible oil products segment net sales were $6.9 billion in 2016 compared to $6.7 billion in 2015. these higher sales are primarily due to a volume increase of 2% resulting from a higher market share of packaged oil products in brazil, refined oils in canada and the additional net sales derived from our acquisition of a 62.8% equity stake in walter rau neusser in germany.
cost of goods sold increased 2% to $6.4 billion in 2016 from $6.3 billion in 2015. the higher costs were in line with the increase in net sales, as noted above. in 2015, cost of goods sold was negatively impacted by a $15 million impairment charge related to the closure of an edible oils packaging facility in the united states.
gross profit increased 9% to $439 million in 2016 from $404 million in 2015. the increase was primarily driven by higher market share for packaged oils products in brazil, stronger demand for refined oil in canada and improved volumes and margins in india, partially offset by weaker margins in our margarines business in europe. in addition, gross profit for 2015 was reduced by the $15 million impairment charge noted above.
sg&a expenses decreased to $320 million in 2016 from $328 million in 2015, primarily as a result of lower marketing expenses, savings from cost-cutting initiatives and the weakening of most currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, partly offset by the appreciation of the brazilian real in 2016.
goodwill and intangible impairments of $13 million in 2015 represent the full impairment of goodwill in our brazilian tomato products business.
segment ebit increased by $53 million to $112 million in 2016, compared to $59 million in 2015. gross profit improved due to increased market share in brazil packaged oils, improved results in refined oil in canada and india, and lower sg&a expenses. additionally, 2015 included impairment charges related to the goodwill of the brazil tomato products business and the closure of an edible oils packaging facility in the united states.
milling products segmentmilling products segment net sales increased by 2% to $1,647 million in 2016 from $1,609 million in 2015, primarily from an 8% increase in volumes primarily as a result of our
42
acquisition of the moinho pacifico wheat mill in brazil, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2015. in addition, sales increased in our rice and corn milling businesses in the united states, partially offset by volume decreases in mexico. the net volume increase was mostly offset by the weakening of the mexican peso by 18% against the u.s. dollar and lower selling prices of flour due to lower commodity prices in wheat, our primary raw material.
cost of goods sold increased slightly to $1,378 million in 2016 from $1,372 million in 2015, primarily driven by volume increase, partially offset by lower commodity prices in wheat, and net foreign exchange effects on local currency industrial costs, lower energy prices in the united states and a recovery of $14 million in brazilian wheat import taxes paid in prior years.
gross profit improved by $32 million to $269 million in 2016 from $237 million in 2015, primarily from higher volumes and improved unit margins in wheat milling products in brazil, the incremental gross profit from the acquisition of the moinho pacifico wheat mill in brazil, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the recovery of $14 million in brazilian import taxes paid in prior years. these increases were partially offset by lower gross profit in mexico as volumes were lower in 2016 compared to 2015.
sg&a expenses increased to $127 million in 2016 from $123 million in 2015, mainly due to sg&a expenses related to the moinho pacifico wheat mill in brazil, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015. this increase was partially offset by the net translation benefit of the stronger brazilian real and weaker mexican peso on the translation of local currency expenses to u.s. dollars as well as benefits from our performance improvement initiatives to contain costs.
segment ebit increased to $131 million in 2016 from $103 million in 2015, primarily as a result of higher gross profit in brazil due to higher volumes and improved margins, results from the moinho pacifico wheat mill, acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015 and a recovery of $14 million in brazilian wheat import taxes paid in prior years.
sugar and bioenergy segmentsugar and bioenergy segment net sales increased 6% to $3.7 billion in 2016 compared to $3.5 billion in 2015, as a result of higher average market prices of raw sugar and ethanol of 39% and 24%, respectively. the impact on sales of these price increases was partially offset by a decrease in volumes in our industrial operations due to the adverse weather in brazil that reduced crushing volume and in our global trading and merchandising activities, where higher global sugar prices reduced demand. in addition, sales in our industrial operations in brazil were lower driven by our commercial decision to carry less inventories into 2016 than we did in the previous year.
cost of goods sold increased 7% to $3.6 billion in 2016 compared to $3.3 billion in 2015, in line with the sales increase noted above, primarily due to the increase in sugar and ethanol prices, partially offset by a decline in volumes.
gross profit was $159 million in 2016 compared to $164 million in 2015. in 2016, higher sugar and ethanol prices in brazil were partly offset by lower volumes, which drove per unit increases in sugar and ethanol industrial cost. gross profit in 2015 benefitted from the classification of currency hedge losses reported separately in foreign exchange gains and losses.
sg&a expenses were $112 million in 2016, 3% higher compared to $109 million in 2015, driven by increases in local currency costs in brazil due to higher inflation, partially offset by lower personnel costs from cost-cutting initiative. in addition the appreciation of the brazilian real, relative to the u.s. dollar resulted in higher expense when converted into u.s. dollar.
foreign exchange results in 2016 were gains of $9 million, compared to losses of $68 million in 2015. these results were related primarily to results on certain currency hedges.
equity investment impairment charges of $44 million in 2016 included an impairment charge of our equity investment in solazyme bunge renewable oils ("sb oils"), our joint venture that operates a commercial-scale algae oils facility adjacent to our moema sugarcane mill in brazil.
43
segment ebit improved by $23 million to a loss of $4 million in 2016, compared to a loss of $27 million in 2015 primarily due to improved results in our industrial operations and foreign exchange gains on certain currency hedges partially offset by impairment of $44 million in sb oils.
fertilizer segmentfertilizer segment net sales increased 4% to $403 million in 2016 compared to $386 million in 2015, primarily due to an increase of 30% in volumes from higher nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer usage in argentina as a result of expanded corn and wheat planting areas. the impact of higher sales was substantially offset by a decrease in global nitrogen, phosphate and single superphosphate prices. in 2015 volumes were impacted by a strike in one of our plants.
cost of goods sold was $350 million in 2016, compared to $356 million in 2015 driven by lower industrial costs and lower costs from nitrogen, as we were required to import higher cost nitrogen last year due to the 2015 strike. this was partially offset by an increase in volumes in 2016. in addition, in 2016 we recorded a reversal of a natural gas tariff reserve of $11 million due to a recent argentine supreme court decision finding the tariff invalid. we also recorded a $9 million impairment charge in 2016 on long lived assets related to a fertilizer production line in one of our plants in argentina.
gross profit increased to $53 million in 2016 from $30 million in 2015. the increase was primarily driven by improved gross profit in argentina resulting from the increased usage of fertilizers by the argentine farmer from planting a larger crop area, improved fertilizer unit margins and lower product costs. gross profit in 2015 was impacted by a strike in one of our plants.
segment ebit improved by $24 million to $29 million in 2016 compared to $5 million in 2015, primarily due to improved gross profit driven by higher volumes and margins in argentina.
interesta summary of consolidated interest income and expense for the periods indicated follows:

interest income         $51            $43
interest expense       (234   )       (258   )
interest income increased by $8 million to $51 million in 2016 compared to $43 million in 2015, primarily due to higher average cash and cash equivalent balances held in certain brazilian operating entities. interest expense decreased $24 million to $234 million in 2016 from $258 million in 2015, primarily due to the reversal of previously recorded interest expense of $16 million for certain icms tax credits in brazil that were recorded in 2014 and $10 million related to unpaid tariffs for natural gas in argentina, which were found invalid by an argentine supreme court ruling in 2016.
discontinued operationsdiscontinued operations results in 2016 were a loss of $9 million, net of tax, compared to income of $35 million, net of tax, in 2015. results declined in 2016 primarily due to cumulative translation adjustments, driven by the appreciation of the brazilian  real relative to the u.s. dollar.
2015 compared to 2014
net income attributable to bungenet income attributable to bunge for 2015 was $791 million compared to $515 million for 2014. the increase in total segment ebit of $292 million discussed below and reduced net interest cost of $45 million driven by lower average borrowings during the year was partially offset by the higher income tax expense ($296 million in 2015 compared with $249 million in 2014) on the higher income from continuing operations, before taxes.
income tax expensein 2015, income tax expense from continuing operations increased to $296 million from $249 million in 2014 and the effective tax rate in 2015 decreased to 28% compared
44
to 34% in 2014. income tax expenses in 2015 included net tax charges of $16 million that resulted primarily from the establishment of income tax valuation allowances in asia-pacific partially offset by the release of income tax valuation allowances in north america. the lower effective tax rate for 2015 resulted mainly from geographical earnings mix and valuation allowance movements.
agribusiness segmentagribusiness segment net sales decreased 26% to $31.3 billion in 2015 compared to $42.1 billion in 2014. the decrease was primarily driven by significantly lower global commodity prices in 2015 compared to 2014, especially soybean prices which were on average 24% lower. volumes decreased 3% driven by lower grain origination and grain and oilseed trading and distribution volumes, partially offset by higher oilseed processing volumes. in our grains business, origination volumes declined in north america due to lower farmer selling and a reduction in volumes related to the sale of certain canadian grain assets in the third quarter to g3 canada limited (formerly the canadian wheat board). argentina grain origination was down as farmers retained their crops in anticipation of a more favorable environment following the december presidential election. the reduced grain origination volumes in north america and argentina were partly offset by higher volumes in brazil during the latter part of 2015 as farmers were strong sellers in order to fix their local brazilian  real sales at relatively high rates as the brazilian real weakened against the u.s. dollar. in oilseed processing, higher volumes in north america, asia, brazil and argentina driven by strong crush margins were fully offset by lower global commodity prices. in our trading and distribution businesses, volumes were lower in both grains and oilseeds in most regions due to a soft margin environment.
cost of goods sold decreased by 27% to $29.4 billion in 2015, compared with $40.4 billion last year as a result of lower global commodity prices and the translation effect of weaker global currencies compared with 2014. the average global price of soybeans, corn and wheat declined 24%, 9% and 14%, respectively in 2015 compared to 2014. the volume decline of 3% noted above also contributed to the decline in cost of goods sold. improvement in ocean freight costs, particularly bunker fuel procurement, and in ports and services also contributed to the lower year-over-year cost. in addition, in the second quarter of 2015 we reversed a $30 million export tax contingency in our argentine subsidiary.
gross profit increased 7% to $1,858 million in 2015 from $1,742 million in 2014, primarily driven by improved performance in our oilseed processing business, particularly in china, argentina, the u.s., and brazil, partially offset by declines in softseed processing in europe and canada. grain trading and distribution also benefitted from improved ocean freight costs and port logistics operations. these increases more than offset weak grain origination margins in the united states primarily driven by lack of export demand due to the impacts of stronger u.s. dollar.
sg&a expenses were $851 million in 2015 compared to $875 million in 2014. sg&a benefitted in 2015 from weaker currencies as local currency costs were translated into u.s. dollars, partially offset by an impairment charge of $14 million in our equity method investment in a freight shipping company and a $9 million charge of administrative tax assessment fees related to export activities in our argentine subsidiary for 2008 through 2009.
foreign exchange gains were $67 million in 2015 compared to gains of $39 million in the same period of 2014. these results were primarily driven by movements in the brazilian real and the argentine peso.
noncontrolling interests represent (income) loss attributed to the noncontrolling interest holders in joint venture operations that are consolidated in our financial statements. the income of $9 million in 2015 compared to income of $23 million in 2014 and was primarily driven by lower results in our u.s. pacific northwest port operation and oilseed and biodiesel production joint ventures in europe.
gain on the sale of canadian grain assets to g3 canada limited (formerly the canadian wheat board) was $47 million.

segment ebit increased 24% to $1,108 million in 2015 from $890 million in 2014 primarily as a result of improved gross profit in our oilseed processing business, grain trading and distribution business, a reduction in sg&a, primarily from the weakening of global currencies against the u.s. dollar and a $47 million gain on the sale of certain assets in canada to g3 canada limited.
edible oil products segmentedible oil products segment net sales were $6.7 billion in 2015 compared to $8.0 billion in 2014. the lower net sales in 2015 were primarily a result of lower global vegetable oil prices and the translation impact of weaker global currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. volumes in 2015 were essentially flat as higher demand in india and china were offset by a decline in brazil and europe, resulting from weak economic conditions, which directly impacted packaged oil and margarine demand.
cost of goods sold decreased 15% to $6.3 billion in 2015 from $7.4 billion in 2014, due to lower raw material costs resulting from market price declines of edible oils, lower demand in brazil and europe, which lowered production volumes, and the translation impact of the weaker global currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. cost of goods sold in 2015 included an impairment charge of $15 million related to the announced closure of one of our u.s. edible oil packaging facilities.
gross profit in 2015 decreased to $404 million from $548 million in 2014. the decrease was driven by lower volumes and margins in brazil and europe as consumers reduced purchases and traded down to lower value products. the impact of the weaker economic environment was partly offset by cost benefits from our performance improvement programs. an impairment charge of $15 million in 2015 relating to the closure of a u.s. facility also contributed to the reduced gross profit.
sg&a expenses decreased to $328 million in 2015 from $482 million in 2014, primarily as a result of the translation benefits of the strengthening u.s. dollar relative to other global currencies, notably the brazilian real, argentine peso and  euro as well as our cost reduction initiatives. in addition, 2014 included $98 million of expenses related to certain icms tax credits in brazil.
a goodwill impairment charge of $13 million, representing all of the goodwill of the brazilian tomato products business, was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 upon completion of our annual impairment analysis.
segment ebit was $59 million in 2015 compared to $58 million in 2014. ebit for 2015 included a charge of $15 million for the announced closure of a packaged oil plant in the united states and a $13 million goodwill impairment charge in our brazilian tomato products business. ebit for 2014 included an expense of $98 million related to certain icms tax credits in brazil. excluding the effects of these items, results declined by $69 million driven by lower volumes and margins in brazil edible oils, and margarines in europe as consumers pulled-back on purchases and traded down to lower value products. this was partially offset by lower sg&a expenses as a result of the factors noted above.
milling products segmentmilling products segment sales decreased by 22% to $1,609 million in 2015 from $2,064 million in 2014 in part due to approximately 9% lower average prices for corn and 14% lower average prices for wheat. volumes declined 7% compared to the same period last year, primarily in our wheat milling business in brazil, which was impacted by the weak economic environment that depressed demand, as well as in our u.s. corn milling operations, driven by soft demand in the ready-to-eat cereal and brewery industries. additionally, the foreign exchange impact from the devaluation of the brazilian real and mexican peso against the u.s. dollar for our brazilian and mexican operations negatively impacted sales.
cost of goods sold decreased 22% to $1,372 million in 2015 from $1,753 million in 2014 primarily due to lower volumes, lower commodity raw material costs in corn and wheat and the translation impact of the devaluation of the brazilian real and mexican peso against the u.s. dollar.
46
gross profit decreased to $237 million in 2015, from $311 million in 2014, primarily due to lower volumes and margins in brazil related to food service and retail channels and lower volumes in u.s. corn milling as a result of depressed demand from the ready-to-eat cereal and brewery industries in the first half of 2015. margins in brazil were adversely impacted by the effects of the currency devaluation.
sg&a expenses decreased by $45 million to $123 million in 2015 from $168 million in 2014 mainly resulting from the benefit of the weaker brazilian  real and mexican peso on the translation of local currency expenses. in addition, 2014 included $14 million of expenses related to certain icms tax credits in brazil.
segment ebit decreased to $103 million in 2015 from $131 million in 2014, as weaker demand in brazil and the u.s. resulted in lower volumes and margins, partially offset by lower sg&a expenses.
sugar and bioenergy segmentsugar and bioenergy segment net sales decreased to $3.5 billion in 2015 compared to $4.5 billion in 2014. the 23% decrease in sales was primarily driven by lower global average prices of sugar and the significant devaluation of the brazilian real impacting our local currency net sales when translated into u.s. dollars. this was partially offset by higher average domestic ethanol prices in brazil and an increase in volumes. on average, the futures price of raw sugar was 20% lower in 2015 compared 2014. average ethanol prices in brazil were higher by 8% driven by a large increase in the fourth quarter. partially offsetting the sales decreases was an improvement in volumes of 8% compared to 2014, primarily due to increased activity in our global trading and merchandising operations.
cost of goods sold decreased 27% to $3.3 billion in 2015, compared to $4.6 billion in 2014, primarily driven by lower prices of purchased sugarcane and the impact of the weaker brazilian real relative to the u.s. dollar, partially offset by higher volumes.
gross profit was $164 million in 2015. this compared to a loss of $41 million in 2014, which included $113 million of impairment and related charges related to one of our sugar mills. excluding the impairment and related charges, results improved by $92 million primarily driven by improved results in our industrial operations resulting from increased efficiency, both in volumes crushed and lower related industrial costs, as well as higher volumes and margins in cogeneration. in our global trading and distribution operations, higher volumes were more than offset by lower margins.
sg&a expenses were $109 million in 2015, 30% lower compared to $156 million in 2014, driven by translation benefits of the devaluation of the brazilian  real on local currency costs, and cost reduction and efficiency initiatives in our sugar milling business. in addition, 2015 and 2014 included $5 million and $20 million, respectively, of restructuring costs, which include costs of our strategic review of the sugar milling business.
foreign exchange results in 2015 were losses of $68 million, compared to gains of $19 million in 2014. these results were related primarily to results on certain currency hedges.
other income (expenses)net was expense of $15 million in 2015 compared to income of $10 million in 2014. results in our north american ethanol investment were lower as the decrease in global oil prices resulted in lower ethanol margins. results also decreased in our joint venture for the production of renewable oils in brazil and our corn wet-milling joint venture in argentina.
segment ebit improved by $141 million to a loss of $27 million in 2015, compared to a loss of $168 million in 2014. results were impacted by $5 million of restructuring charges and $133 million of impairment and restructuring charges in 2015 and 2014, respectively. excluding the impairment and restructuring charges, results improved by $13 million due to improved performance in our industrial milling operations in brazil and lower sg&a expenses from the translation benefit of the weaker brazilian  real on local currency costs, partially offset by foreign exchange losses and lower results in certain joint ventures.
47
fertilizer segmentfertilizer segment net sales decreased 19% to $386 million in 2015 compared to $474 million in 2014, primarily due to lower fertilizer imports in brazil. in argentina, sales declined mainly due to lower volumes driven by reduced fertilizer usage by argentine farmers as a result of the local economic environment and lower farm margins for corn and wheat production. in addition, in the first quarter of 2015, volumes were reduced due to a strike at one of our facilities.
cost of goods sold was $356 million in 2015, compared to $413 million in 2014. lower volumes and raw material costs and the translation benefit of the weaker argentine  peso, were partly offset by higher cost imports of nitrogen due to the aforementioned strike.
gross profit decreased to $30 million in 2015 from $61 million in 2014. the decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes and not fully recovered industrial costs in our brazilian port operations. gross profit in our argentine operation was impacted by higher production costs, depressed volumes from lower farmer fertilizer usage and impacts of a strike at one of our facilities.
sg&a was $24 million in 2015 compared to $10 million in 2014. the lower expense in 2014 includes the reversal of certain value added tax, labor and bad debt provisions in brazil.
noncontrolling interests represents (income) loss attributed to the noncontrolling interest holders in operations that are consolidated in our financial statements. the $1 million income in 2015 and $5 million income in 2014 represents the noncontrolling interests share of income at our non-wholly owned brazilian port operations.
segment ebit decreased to $5 million in 2015, compared to $45 million in 2014, mainly driven by lower gross profit in our brazilian port operations, the impact of the strike and weaker farmer usage of fertilizer in argentina and the positive sg&a impact on 2014 results.
interesta summary of consolidated interest income and expense for the periods indicated follows:

interest income         $43            $87
interest expense       (258   )       (347   )
interest income decreased to $43 million when compared to the same period of 2014, as a result of lower cash investments in brazil and argentina and $12 million of accumulated interest on a loan provided to and repaid by a related party in 2014. interest expense decreased by 26% compared to last year, primarily due to lower average outstanding debt, mainly as a result of reduced working capital requirements due to lower global commodity prices in 2015 and interest charges of $65 million related to certain icms tax credits in brazil.
discontinued operationsdiscontinued operations results in 2015 were income of $35 million, net of tax, compared to income of $32 million, net of tax, in 2014. results in 2015, included gains in brazilian fertilizer driven by foreign exchange gains and the recovery of previously written-off farmer receivables, which were partly offset by losses in our asset management business. results in 2014 included benefits related to a tax amnesty program in brazil and collections of previously written-off farmer receivables.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity our main financial objectives are to prudently manage financial risks, ensure consistent access to liquidity and minimize cost of capital in order to efficiently finance our business and maintain balance sheet strength. we generally finance our ongoing operations with cash flows generated from operations,
48
issuance of commercial paper, borrowings under various bilateral and syndicated revolving credit facilities, term loans and proceeds from the issuance of senior notes. acquisitions and long-lived assets are generally financed with a combination of equity and long-term debt.
our current ratio, which is a widely used measure of liquidity and is defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, was 1.44 and 1.49 at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
cash and cash equivalentscash and cash equivalents were $934 million at december 31, 2016 and $411 million at december 31, 2015. cash balances are managed in accordance with our investment policy, the objectives of which are to preserve the principal value of our cash assets, maintain a high degree of liquidity and deliver competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions. cash balances are invested in short-term deposits with highly rated financial institutions and in u.s. government securities.
readily marketable inventories ("rmi")rmi are agricultural commodity inventories, such as soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, corn, wheat, and sugar that are readily convertible to cash because of their commodity characteristics, widely available markets and international pricing mechanisms. rmi in our agribusiness segment are reported at fair value and were $3,593 million at december 31, 2016 and $3,393 million at december 31, 2015. of these amounts $2,523 million and $2,513 million were attributable to merchandising activities at december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, respectively. rmi at fair value in the aggregate amount of $123 million and $110 million at december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, respectively, were included in our edible oil products segment inventories. the sugar and bioenergy segment included rmi of $139 million and $163 million at december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, respectively which can be attributed to our trading and merchandising business.
financing arrangements and outstanding indebtednesswe conduct most of our financing activities through a centralized financing structure that provides the company efficient access to debt and capital markets. this structure includes a master trust, the primary assets of which consist of intercompany loans made to bunge limited and its subsidiaries. certain of bunge limited's 100% owned finance subsidiaries, bunge limited finance corp., bunge finance europe b.v. and bunge asset funding corp., fund the master trust with short and long-term debt obtained from third parties, including through our commercial paper program and certain credit facilities, as well as the issuance of senior notes. borrowings by these finance subsidiaries carry full, unconditional guarantees by bunge limited.
revolving credit facilitiesat december 31, 2016, we had $5,015 million of aggregate committed borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program and various revolving bilateral and syndicated credit facilities, of which all was unused and available. the following table summarizes these facilities as of the periods presented:

commercial paper                           2019                   $600              $          $

(1)
borrowings under the revolving credit facilities that have maturities greater than one year from the date of the consolidated balance sheets are classified as long-term debt, consistent with the long-term maturity of the underlying facilities. however, individual borrowings under the revolving credit facilities are generally short-term in nature, bear interest at variable rates and can be repaid or renewed as each such individual borrowing matures.
49
on june 24, 2016, we completed the refinancing on a $200 million three-year committed unsecured bilateral revolving credit facility, to mature on june 24, 2019. a further $500 million of unsecured bilateral revolving credit facilities were refinanced on september 23, 2016 to mature on september 23, 2019. borrowings under these facilities bear interest at libor plus a margin, which will vary from 0.65% to 1.40% per annum based on the credit ratings on its senior long-term unsecured debt. amounts under the facilities that remain undrawn are subject to a commitment fee payable at a rate ranging from 0.20% to 0.25%.
in addition to committed credit facilities, from time-to-time, we, through our financing subsidiaries, enter into bilateral short-term credit lines as necessary based on our financing requirements. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, no borrowings were outstanding under these bilateral short-term credit lines.
short and long-term debtour short and long-term debt decreased by $179 million at december 31, 2016 from december 31, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements in the latter part of the year. for the year ended december 31, 2016, our average short and long-term debt outstanding was approximately $5,201 million compared to approximately $4,316 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily due to higher average working capital financing requirements, driven by higher average global commodity prices. our long-term debt outstanding balance was $4,007 million at december 31, 2016 compared to $3,795 million at december 31, 2015. the following table summarizes our short-term debt activity at december 31, 2016.

on august 15, 2016, we completed the sale of $700 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% senior notes due august 15, 2026. the unsecured senior notes were issued by bunge's 100% owned finance subsidiary, bunge limited finance corp., and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by bunge. the offering was made pursuant to a registration statement filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission. the net proceeds of $695 million were used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repayment of outstanding indebtedness, which includes indebtedness under revolving credit facilities.
on june 16, 2016, we completed the sale of 600 million euro (approximately $670 million) aggregate principal amount of 1.85% senior notes due june 16, 2023 ("notes"). additionally, on november 17, 2016 we completed the sale of 200 million euro (approximately $214 million) of the notes bringing the aggregate principal amount to 800 million euro. the notes were issued by bunge's 100% owned finance subsidiary, bunge finance europe b.v., and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by bunge. the offering was made pursuant to a registration statement filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission. the aggregated net proceeds of 802 million euro (approximately $887 million) were used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to the repayment of outstanding indebtedness, which includes indebtedness under revolving credit facilities.

credit ratingsbunge's debt ratings and outlook by major credit rating agencies at december 31, 2016 were as follows:

standard &amp; poor's   a-1         bbb    stable moody's                 p-1         baa2   stable fitch                   not rated   bbb    stable
(1)
short-term rating applies only to bunge asset funding corp., the issuer under our commercial paper program.
our debt agreements do not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate maturity of our debt. however, credit rating downgrades would increase our borrowing costs under our syndicated credit facilities and, depending on their severity, could impede our ability to obtain credit facilities or access the capital markets in the future on competitive terms. a significant increase in our borrowing costs could impair our ability to compete effectively in our business relative to competitors with higher credit ratings.
our credit facilities and certain senior notes require us to comply with specified financial covenants, including minimum net worth, minimum current ratio, a maximum debt to capitalization ratio and limitations on secured indebtedness. we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31, 2016.
trade receivable securitization programwe initially entered into our trade receivable securitization program (the "program") in june 2011, which provides us with an additional source of liquidity. on may 26, 2016, bunge and certain of its subsidiaries renewed and amended its $700 million trade receivables securitization program, which terminates on may 26, 2021. however, each committed purchaser's commitment to fund trade receivables sold under the program will terminate on may 26, 2019 unless extended in accordance with the terms of the receivables transfer agreement.
at december 31, 2016 and 2015, $628 million and $524 million, respectively, of receivables sold under the program were derecognized from our consolidated balance sheets. proceeds received in cash related to transfers of receivables under the program totaled $9,197 million and $10,396 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. in addition, cash collections from customers on receivables previously sold were $9,176 million and $10,542 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. as this is a revolving facility, cash collections from customers are reinvested to fund new receivable sales. gross receivables sold under the program for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 were $9,405 million and $10,601 million, respectively. these sales resulted in discounts of $6 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, $5 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 and $7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, which were included in sg&a in the consolidated statements of income. servicing fees under the program were not significant in any period.
our risk of loss following the sale of the trade receivables is limited to the deferred purchase price receivable ("dpp"), which at december 31, 2016 and 2015 had a fair value of $87 million and $79 million, respectively, and is included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets (see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements). the dpp will be repaid in cash as receivables are collected, generally within 30 days. delinquencies and credit losses on trade receivables sold under the program during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were insignificant. we have reflected all cash flows under the program as operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015.
52
interest rate swap agreementswe may use interest rate swaps as hedging instruments and record the swaps at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded contemporaneously in earnings. additionally, the carrying amount of the associated debt is adjusted through earnings for changes in the fair value due to changes in benchmark interest rates. ineffectiveness, as defined in asc topic 815 derivatives and hedging, is recognized to the extent that these two adjustments do not offset.
equitytotal equity is set forth in the following table:

total bunge shareholders' equity increased to $7,144 million at december 31, 2016 from $6,441 million at december 31, 2015. the change in equity was primarily due to net income attributable to bunge for the year ended december 31, 2016 of $745 million and cumulative translation gains of $709 million, resulting from the revaluation of global currencies relative to the u.s. dollar in 2016. this increase partially offset by paid dividends to common and preferred shareholders of $223 million and $34 million, respectively and treasury shares acquired of $200 million.
noncontrolling interest decreased to $199 million at december 31, 2016 from $211 million at december 31, 2015 primarily due to deconsolidation of a variable interest entity that was previously consolidated and dividends paid to non-controlling interest holders, partly offset by the acquisition of a majority share in walter rau neusser.
at december 31, 2016, we had 6,900,000 4.875% cumulative convertible perpetual preference shares outstanding with an aggregate liquidation preference of $690 million. each convertible perpetual preference share has an initial liquidation preference of $100, which will be adjusted for any accumulated and unpaid dividends. the convertible perpetual preference shares carry an annual dividend of $4.875 per share payable quarterly. as a result of adjustments made to the initial conversion price because cash dividends paid on bunge limited's common shares exceeded certain specified thresholds, each convertible perpetual preference share is convertible, at the holder's option, at any time into 1.1507 bunge limited common shares, based on the conversion price of $86.901 per share, subject to certain additional anti-dilution adjustments (which represents 7,939,830 bunge limited common shares at december 31, 2016). at any time, if the closing price of our common shares equals or exceeds 130% of the conversion price for 20 trading days during any consecutive 30 trading days (including the last trading day of such period), we may elect to cause the convertible perpetual preference shares to be automatically converted into bunge limited common shares at the then-prevailing conversion price. the convertible perpetual preference shares are not redeemable by us at any time.
cash flows our cash flow from operations varies depending on, among other items, the market prices and timing of the purchase and sale of our inventories. generally, during periods when commodity prices are rising, our agribusiness operations require increased use of cash to support working capital to acquire inventories and fund daily settlement requirements on exchange traded futures that we use to minimize price risk related to our inventories.

2016 compared to 2015in 2016, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $523 million reflecting the net effect of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. for the year ended december 31, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $49 million reflecting the net effect of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
cash provided by our operating activities was $1,904 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $610 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. net cash inflows from operating activities for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, were principally due to net income, including adjustments for non-cash items, and a decrease in the use of cash for net operating assets and liabilities. in 2016, higher prices for sugar and the soybean complex, together with essentially flat volumes resulted in higher working capital needs, however this was more than offset by initiatives to reduce working capital and an appreciation of the brazilian real relative to the u.s. dollar, which mostly impacted trade accounts payable in our brazilian operations. in 2015, the increase in net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to increases in secured advances to farmers in south america, who were motivated to sell their record level crops as the brazilian real and argentine peso depreciated relative to the u.s. dollar.
certain of our non-u.s. operating subsidiaries are primarily funded with u.s. dollar-denominated debt, while currency risk is hedged with u.s. dollar denominated assets. the functional currency of our operating subsidiaries is generally the local currency. in addition, certain of our u.s. dollar functional operating subsidiaries outside the united states are partially funded with local currency borrowings, while the currency risk is hedged with local currency denominated assets. the financial statements of our subsidiaries are calculated in the functional currency, and when the local currency is the functional currency, translated into u.s. dollar. u.s. dollar-denominated loans are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates at the applicable balance sheet date. local currency loans are remeasured into u.s. dollar at the exchange rate at the applicable balance sheet date. the resulting gain or loss is included in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange gains or losses. for the years ended december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, we recorded foreign exchange losses of $80 million and gains of $213 million, respectively, which were included as adjustments to reconcile net income to cash used for operating activities in the line item "foreign exchange loss (gain) on debt" in our consolidated statements of cash flows. this adjustment is required because the cash flow impacts of these gains or losses are non-cash items and will represent financing activities when the subsidiary repays the underlying debt and therefore, have no impact on cash flows from operations.
cash used for investing activities was $926 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $802 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. during 2016, payments made for capital expenditures of $784 million, compared to $649 million during 2015, were primarily related to replanting of sugarcane and maintenance and improvements for our industrial sugar business in brazil, upgrade and expansion of an export terminal in the united states, construction of a wheat milling facility in brazil, the expansion of a port facility in ukraine and the construction of oilseed processing plants in ukraine and asia-pacific. in addition, we acquired for $34 million walter rau neusser, a vegetable oil blends producer for large-scale commercial customers, based in germany. in the year ended december 31, 2015, we paid $347 million for the acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired. in the year ended december 31, 2016, we had cash outflows related to settlements of net investment hedges of $375 million in the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily driven by the appreciation of the brazilian real relative to the us dollar in 2016, compared to cash inflows of $203 million in the year ended december 31, 2015. proceeds from disposition of investment in affiliates included $145 million and $33 million for the disposition of equity interests of operations in brazil and vietnam, respectively. in addition, we sold 10% of our minority share in g3 global holdings gp inc. ("g3") for net proceeds of $37 million to our joint venture partner, saudi agricultural and livestock investment company (or salic). proceeds from and payments for investments for both years 2016 and 2015 included primarily purchases and sales of certain marketable securities and other short term
54
investments. investments in affiliates in 2016 included additional investments in sb oils, our joint venture with terravia holdings inc. to produce renewable oils in brazil and g3.
cash used for financing activities was $488 million in the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $360 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. the cash used for financing activities is primarily reflecting lower working capital needs, partially offset by an increase of cash used for investing activities. dividends paid to our common shareholders and holders of our convertible preference shares were $257 million and $241 million, for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. in connection with our common share repurchase program, in 2016, we purchased 3,296,230 of our common shares at a cost of $200 million and in 2015, we purchased 3,871,810 of our common shares at a cost of $300 million. in the year ended december 31, 2016, we paid $25 million of dividends to non-controlling interest holders and $39 million for the acquisition of the non-controlling interest of a joint venture in europe.
2015 compared to 2014in 2015, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $49 million reflecting the net effect of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. for the year ended december 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $380 million.
cash provided by our operating activities was $610 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $1,399 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. net cash inflows from operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2015 were principally due to net income, including adjustments for non cash items, partially offset by an increase in the use of cash for net operating assets and liabilities. the increase in net operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to increases in secured advances to farmers in south america who were motivated to sell their record level crops as the brazilian real and argentine peso depreciated relative to the u.s. dollar. the net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2014 were principally due to net income, including adjustments for non-cash items. the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities in 2014 is primarily due to lower working capital levels than at december 31, 2013, resulting from, on average, lower global commodity prices, which effect was partially offset by the impact of the depreciation from certain currencies including the brazilian real, argentine peso, ukrainian hryvnia and the euro relative to the u.s. dollar.
certain of our non u.s. operating subsidiaries are primarily funded with u.s. dollar denominated debt, while currency risk is hedged with u.s. dollar denominated assets. the functional currency of our operating subsidiaries is generally the local currency. also, certain of our u.s. dollar functional operating subsidiaries outside the united states are partially funded with local currency borrowings, while the currency risk is hedged with local currency denominated assets. the financial statements of our subsidiaries are calculated in the functional currency, and when the local currency is the functional currency, translated into u.s. dollar. u.s. dollar denominated loans are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates at the applicable balance sheet date. local currency loans are remeasured into u.s. dollar at the exchange rate at the applicable balance sheet date. the resulting gain or loss is included in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange gains or losses. for the years ended december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, we recorded foreign exchange gains of $213 million and $215 million, respectively, which were included as adjustments to reconcile net income to cash used for operating activities in the line item "foreign exchange loss (gain) on debt" in our consolidated statements of cash flows. this adjustment is required because the cash flow impacts of these gains or losses are non cash items and will represent financing activities when the subsidiary repays the underlying debt and therefore, have no impact on cash flows from operations.
cash used for investing activities was $802 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to cash used of $685 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. during 2015, payments made for capital expenditures of $649 million were primarily related to replanting of sugarcane and maintenance and improvements for our industrial sugar business in brazil, upgrade and expansion of an
55
export terminal in the united states, construction of a wheat milling facility in brazil, the expansion of a port facility in ukraine and construction of oilseed processing plants in ukraine and in asia pacific. we also acquired moinho pacifico, a brazilian wheat mill and port terminal in santos, brazil, whole harvest foods, a u.s. refiner and packager of expeller pressed commercial cooking oil and heartland harvest, inc., a u.s. based producer of die cut pellets for the snack food industry, and the remaining interest in a spanish biodiesel production facility. proceeds from settlement of net investment hedges totaled $203 million. proceeds from sales of investment in affiliates included net proceeds of $88 million for the sale of certain assets in our grain business in canada to g3 canada limited (formerly the canadian wheat board). capital expenditures in 2015 were $649 million, 23% lower compared to $839 million in 2014, as a result of management's disciplined capital management and generally lower capital expenditures in our industrial sugar and bioenergy operations in brazil. proceeds from and payments for investments for both years 2015 and 2014 included primarily sales of assets in funds in our asset management business and the purchases and sales of certain marketable securities and other short term investments. investments in affiliates in 2015 included our payment for our share of g3 canada limited (formerly the canadian wheat board) and additional investments in sb oils, our joint venture with solazyme, inc. to produce renewable oils in brazil. investments in affiliates in 2014 included primarily investments in sb oils.
cash provided by financing activities was $360 million in the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to cash used for financing activities of $1,058 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to net borrowings of debt of $882 million, which were used to fund capital expenditures and increased activity in acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates. dividends paid to our common shareholders and holders of our convertible preference shares were $241 million and $221 million, for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. in connection with our common share repurchase program, in 2015 we purchased 3,871,810 of our common shares at a cost of $300 million and in 2014 we purchased 3,780,987 of our common shares at a cost of $300 million. for the year ended december 31, 2014, financing activities reflected reduced financing requirements due to a declining global commodity price environment.
brazilian farmer credit backgroundwe advance funds to farmers, primarily in brazil, through secured advances to suppliers and prepaid commodity purchase contracts. these activities are generally intended to be short-term in nature. the ability of our customers and suppliers to repay these amounts is affected by agricultural economic conditions in the relevant geography, which are, in turn, affected by commodity prices, currency exchange rates, crop input costs and crop quality and yields. as a result, these arrangements are typically secured by the farmer's crop and, in many cases, the farmer's land and other assets. upon farmer default, we generally initiate legal proceedings to recover the defaulted amounts. however, the legal recovery process through the judicial system is a long-term process, generally spanning a number of years. as a result, once accounts have been submitted to the judicial process for recovery, we may also seek to renegotiate certain terms with the defaulting farmer in order to accelerate recovery of amounts owed. in addition, we have tightened our credit policies to reduce exposure to higher risk accounts and have increased collateral requirements for certain customers.
because brazilian farmer credit exposures are denominated in local currency, reported values are impacted by movements in the value of the brazilian  real when translated into u.s. dollars. from december 31, 2015 to december 31, 2016, the brazilian  real appreciated by approximately 17%, increasing the reported farmer credit exposure balances when translated into u.s. dollars.
we periodically evaluate the collectability of our farmer receivable and record allowances if we determine that collection is doubtful. we base our determination of the allowance on analyses of credit quality of individual accounts, considering also the economic and financial condition of the farming
56
industry and other market conditions as well as the value of any collateral related to amounts owed. we continuously review defaulted farmer receivables for impairment on an individual account basis. we consider all accounts in legal collections processes to be defaulted and past due. for such accounts, we determine the allowance for uncollectible amounts based on the fair value of the associated collateral, net of estimated costs to sell. for all renegotiated accounts (current and past due), we consider changes in farm economic conditions and other market conditions, our historical experience related to renegotiated accounts and the fair value of collateral in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts.
secured advances to suppliers and prepaid commodity contractswe purchase soybeans through prepaid commodity purchase contracts (advance cash payments to suppliers against contractual obligations to deliver specified quantities of soybeans in the future) and secured advances to suppliers (advances to suppliers against commitments to deliver soybeans in the future), primarily in brazil. these financing arrangements are typically secured by the farmer's future crop and mortgages on the farmer's land, buildings and equipment, and are generally settled after the farmer's crop is harvested and sold.
interest earned on secured advances to suppliers of $38 million, $38 million and $37 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is included in net sales in the consolidated statements of income.
the table below shows details of prepaid commodity contracts and secured advances to suppliers outstanding at our brazilian operations as of the dates indicated. see notes 5 and 11 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.

capital expenditures our cash payments made for capital expenditures were $784 million, $649 million and $839 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we intend to make capital expenditures of approximately $750 million in 2017. our priorities for 2017 capital expenditures are growth, maintenance and compliance projects first (where we expect to use approximately 66% of our funds allocated to capital expenditures), followed by projects enhancing productivity of our operations, and sugar planting. we intend to fund these capital expenditures primarily with cash flows from operations.

off-balance sheet arrangements guarantees we have issued or were party to the following guarantees at december 31, 2016:

unconsolidated affiliates financing(1)(2)       $99
residual value guarantee(3)                     222
total                                           $321
(1)
we issued guarantees to certain financial institutions related to debt of certain of our unconsolidated joint ventures. the terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms of the related financings, which have maturity dates in 2017 through 2022. there are no recourse provisions or collateral that would enable us to recover any amounts paid under these guarantees. at december 31, 2016, we had no outstanding recorded obligation related to these guarantees.
(2)
we issued guarantees to certain third parties related to performance of its unconsolidated joint ventures. there are no recourse provisions or collateral that would enable us to recover any amounts paid under these guarantees. at december 31, 2016, we had no outstanding recorded obligation related to these guarantees.
(3)
we issued guarantees to certain financial institutions which are party to certain operating lease arrangements for railcars and barges. these guarantees provide for a minimum residual value to be received by the lessor at the conclusion of the lease term. these leases expire at various dates from 2018 through 2021. at december 31, 2016, our recorded obligation related to these guarantees was $4 million.
bunge limited has provided a guaranty to the director of the illinois department of agriculture as trustee for bunge north america, inc. ("bna"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, which guarantees all amounts due and owing by bna, to grain producers and/or depositors in the state of illinois who have delivered commodities to bna's illinois facilities.
in addition, bunge limited has provided full and unconditional parent level guarantees of the outstanding indebtedness under certain senior credit facilities and senior notes entered into or issued by its 100% owned subsidiaries. at december 31, 2016, debt with a carrying amount of $4,035 million related to these guarantees is included in our consolidated balance sheet. this debt includes the senior notes issued by two of our 100% owned finance subsidiaries, bunge limited finance corp. and bunge n.a. finance l.p. there are largely no restrictions on the ability of bunge limited finance corp., bunge n.a. finance l.p. or any other of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to bunge limited.

in the ordinary course of business, we enter into purchase commitments for time on ocean freight vessels and freight service on railroad lines for the purpose of transporting agricultural commodities. in addition, we sell time on these ocean freight vessels when excess freight capacity is available. payments to be received by us under such relet agreements are anticipated to be approximately $10 million in 2017. these agreements range from two months to approximately seven years in the case of ocean freight vessels and 5 to 9 years in the case of railroad services. actual amounts paid under these contracts may differ due to the variable components of these agreements and the amount of income earned by us on the sale of excess capacity. the railroad freight services agreements require a minimum monthly payment regardless of the actual level of freight services used by us. the costs of our freight supply agreements are typically passed through to our customers as a component of the prices we charge for our products. however, changes in the market value of freight compared to the rates at which we have contracted for freight may affect margins on the sales of agricultural commodities.
(4)
does not include estimated payments of liabilities associated with uncertain income tax positions. as of december 31, 2016, bunge had tax liabilities of $130 million, including interest and penalties. at this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
(5)
does not include obligations for pension and postretirement benefits for which we expect to make employer contributions of $21 million in 2017. we also expect to make a significant contribution to our plans in future years.
in addition, we have entered into partnership agreements for the production of sugarcane. these agreements have an average remaining life of four years and cover approximately 211,017 hectares of land under cultivation. amounts owed under these agreements are dependent on several variables including the quantity of sugarcane produced per hectare, the total recoverable sugar ("atr") per ton of sugarcane produced and the price for each kilogram of atr as determined by consecana, the são
59
paulo state sugarcane, sugar and ethanol council. during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we made payments related to these agreements of $154 million, $125 million and $162 million, respectively. of these amounts $89 million, $75 million and $95 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, were advances for future purchases and $65 million, $50 million and $67 million were included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
employee benefit plans we expect to contribute $13 million to our defined benefit pension plans and $8 million to our postretirement healthcare benefit plans in 2017.
critical accounting policies and estimates the company's accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included as part of this annual report on form 10-k. as disclosed in note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make substantial judgment or estimation in their application that may significantly affect reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company's most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.
allowances for uncollectible accounts accounts receivable and secured advances to suppliers are stated at the historical carrying amounts net of write-offs and allowances for uncollectible accounts. we establish an allowance for uncollectible trade accounts receivable and secured advances to farmers based on historical experience, farming, economic and other market conditions as well as specific identified customer collection issues. uncollectible accounts are written off when a settlement is reached for an amount that is less than the outstanding historical balance or when we have determined that collection of the balance is unlikely.
we follow the accounting guidance on the disclosure of the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses which requires information to be disclosed at disaggregated levels, defined as portfolio segments and classes. based upon an analysis of credit losses and risk factors to be considered in determining the allowance for credit losses, we have determined that the long-term receivables from farmers in brazil are a single portfolio segment.
we evaluate this single portfolio segment by class of receivables, which is defined as a level of information (below a portfolio segment) in which the receivables have the same initial measurement attribute and a similar method for assessing and monitoring risk. we have identified accounts in legal collection processes and renegotiated amounts as classes of long-term receivables from farmers. valuation allowances for accounts in legal collection processes are determined by us on individual accounts based on the fair value of the collateral provided as security for the secured advance or credit sale. the fair value is determined using a combination of internal and external resources, including published information concerning brazilian land values by region. for determination of the valuation allowances for renegotiated amounts, we consider historical experience with the individual farmers, current weather and crop conditions, as well as the fair value of non-crop collateral.
for both classes, a long-term receivable from farmers in brazil is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if we determine it to be probable that all amounts due under the original terms of the receivable will not be collected. recognition of interest income on secured advances to farmers is suspended once the farmer defaults on the originally scheduled delivery of agricultural commodities as the collection of future income is determined not to be probable. no

additional interest income is accrued from the point of default until ultimate recovery, where amounts collected are credited first against the receivable and then to any unrecognized interest income.
inventories and derivatives we use derivative instruments for the purpose of managing the exposures associated with agricultural commodity prices, transportation costs, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and energy costs and for positioning our overall portfolio relative to expected market movements in accordance with established policies and procedures. we are exposed to loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties to certain of these contracts. the risk of non-performance is routinely monitored and adjustments recorded, if necessary, to account for potential non-performance. different assumptions, changes in economic circumstances or the deterioration of the financial condition of the counterparties to these derivative instruments could result in additional fair value adjustments and changes in expense reflected in cost of goods sold, foreign exchange or interest expense. we did not have significant valuation adjustments relating to non-performance by counterparties at december 31, 2016 or 2015.
our rmi, forward purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and options are primarily valued at fair value. rmi are freely-traded, have quoted market prices, may be sold without significant additional processing and have predictable and insignificant disposal costs. we estimate fair values of commodity inventories and forward purchase and sale contracts based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets. changes in the fair values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in our consolidated statements of income as a component of cost of goods sold. if we used different methods or factors to estimate fair values, amounts reported as inventories and unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts in the consolidated balance sheets and cost of goods sold could differ. additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year-end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories, unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and cost of goods sold could differ.
recoverable taxes we evaluate the collectability of our recoverable taxes and record allowances if we determine that collection is doubtful. recoverable taxes include value-added taxes paid upon the acquisition of fixed assets, raw materials and taxable services and other transactional taxes, which can be recovered in cash or as compensation against income taxes, or other taxes we may owe, primarily in brazil. management's assumption about the collectability of recoverable taxes requires significant judgment because it involves an assessment of the ability and willingness of the applicable federal or local government to refund the taxes. the balance of these allowances fluctuates depending on the sales activity of existing inventories, purchases of new inventories, percentages of export sales, seasonality, changes in applicable tax rates, cash payment by the applicable government agencies and compensation of outstanding balances against income or certain other taxes owed to the applicable governments. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, the allowance for recoverable taxes was $35 million and $32 million, respectively. we continue to monitor the economic environment and events taking place in the applicable countries and in cases where we determine that recovery is doubtful, recoverable taxes are reduced by allowances for the estimated unrecoverable amounts.
property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets. when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of property, plant and equipment assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the undiscounted projected future cash flows to be generated by such assets. if it appears that the carrying value of our assets is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss as a charge against results of operations. our judgments related to the expected useful lives of property, plant and
61
equipment assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amount of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our property, plant and equipment assets, changes in these factors could cause us to realize material impairment charges. we recorded impairment charges of $9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily related to the impairment of an argentina fertilizer plant.
contingencies we are a party to a large number of claims and lawsuits, primarily non-income tax and labor claims in brazil and non-income tax claims in argentina, and have accrued our estimates of the probable costs to resolve these claims. these estimates have been developed in consultation with in-house and outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings. for more information on tax and labor claims in brazil, see "item 3. legal proceedings."
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we are likely to realize. we consider projections of future taxable income and prudent tax planning strategies to assess the need for and the size of the valuation allowances. if we determine that we can realize a deferred tax asset in excess of our net recorded amount, we decrease the valuation allowance, thereby decreasing income tax expense. conversely, if we determine that we are unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset, we increase the valuation allowance, thereby increasing income tax expense.
we apply a "more likely than not" threshold to the recognition and de-recognition of tax benefits. accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. the calculation of our uncertain tax positions involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. future changes in judgment related to the ultimate resolution of unrecognized tax benefits will affect the earnings in the quarter of such change. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, we had recorded uncertain tax positions of $130 million and $64 million, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets. for additional information on income taxes, please refer to note 13 of the consolidated financial statements.

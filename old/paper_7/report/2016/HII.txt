item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business huntington ingalls industries, inc. is america's largest military shipbuilding company and a provider of professional services to partners in government and industry. for more than a century, our ingalls and newport news segments in mississippi and virginia have built more ships in more ship classes than any other u.s. naval shipbuilder. our technical solutions segment provides a wide range of professional services, including fleet support, integrated missions solutions, nuclear and environmental, and oil and gas services. headquartered in newport news, virginia, hii employs approximately 37,000 people operating both domestically and internationally.
we conduct most of our business with the u.s. government, principally the dod. as prime contractor, principal subcontractor, team member, or partner, we participate in many high-priority u.s. defense technology programs. ingalls includes our non-nuclear ship design, construction, repair, and maintenance businesses. newport news includes all of our nuclear ship design, construction, overhaul, refueling, and repair and maintenance businesses. we also provide a range of services to the governmental, energy, and oil and gas markets through our technical solutions segment.
the following discussion should be read along with the audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
business environment in august 2011, the bca established limits on u.s. government discretionary spending, including a reduction of defense spending by approximately $487 billion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021. the bca also provided that the defense budget would face "sequestration" cuts of up to an additional $500 billion during that same period, to the extent that discretionary spending limits are exceeded, and $500 billion for non-defense discretionary spending, including the u.s. coast guard.
the bba 2015 provided sequestration relief for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, but sequestration remains in effect for fiscal years 2018 through 2021. long-term uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending, and it is likely that u.s. government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to significant pressure despite the president's recent executive order indicating the new administration's desire to increase investment in readiness and modernization.
we cannot predict the impact that sequestration cuts or reprioritization of readiness and modernization investment may have on funding for our individual programs. long-term funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced, delayed, or canceled. in addition, spending cuts and/or reprioritization of defense investment could adversely affect the viability of our suppliers and subcontractors and employee base. our contracts or subcontracts under programs in which we participate may be terminated or adjusted by the u.s. government or the prime contractor as a result of lack of government funding or reductions or delays in government funding. significant reductions in the number of ships procured by the u.s. navy or significant delays in funding our ship programs would have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
the budget environment, including sequestration as currently mandated, remains a significant long-term risk. considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will develop and what challenges budget changes will present for the defense industry. we believe continued budget pressures that result from sequestration will have serious negative consequences for the security of our country, the defense industrial base, including us, and the customers, employees, suppliers, subcontractors, investors, and communities that rely on companies in the defense industrial base. although it is difficult to determine specific impacts, we expect that over the longer term, the budget environment may result in fewer contract awards and lower revenues, profits, and cash flows from our u.s. government contracts. congress and the new administration continue to discuss various options to address sequestration in future budget planning, but we cannot predict the outcome of these efforts. it is likely budget and program decisions made in this environment will have long-term impacts on us and the entire defense industry.

defense industry overview the united states faces a complex, uncertain, and rapidly changing national security environment. the defense of the united states and its allies requires the ability to respond to constantly evolving threats, terrorist acts, regional conflicts, and cyber attacks, responses to which are increasingly dependent on early threat identification. national responses to such threats can require unilateral or cooperative initiatives that include dissuasion, deterrence, active defense, security and stability operations, and peacekeeping. we believe the u.s. government will continue to place a high priority on the protection of its engaged forces and citizenry and on minimizing collateral damage when force must be applied in pursuit of national objectives.
the united states' engagement in combating terrorism around the world, coupled with the need to modernize u.s. military forces, has driven dod funding levels since 2001. in march 2014, the dod released its report of the quadrennial defense review ("qdr"), a legislatively-mandated review of military strategy and priorities that shapes defense funding over the ensuing four years. the qdr built upon the 2012 defense strategic guidance, prioritizing three strategic pillars: defending the homeland; building security globally by projecting u.s. influence and deterring aggression; and remaining prepared to win decisively against any adversary should deterrence fail. guided by this updated defense strategy, dod plans to rebalance the military over the next decade and put it on a sustainable path to protect and advance u.s. interests and sustain u.s. global leadership. the new administration has also announced that it intends to undertake a review to assess readiness conditions, including training, equipment maintenance, munitions, modernization, and infrastructure, to guide the development of a budget amendment for fiscal year 2017, as well as budget requests for fiscals years 2018 and 2019.
we expect that the dod execution of its strategy will require an affordable balance between investments in current missions and investments in new capabilities to meet future challenges. the dod faces the additional challenge of recapitalizing equipment and rebuilding readiness at a time when the dod is pursuing modernization of its capabilities, while still facing additional budget cuts from sequestration. while the bba 2015 provided sequestration relief for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, it is unclear how sequestration could impact programs for 2018 and beyond. bca spending caps could have a significant impact on future spending plans for defense and non-defense discretionary programs. decreases in the proposed funding levels for our programs could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, including revenues, goodwill, and long-lived assets.
in july 2016, the u.s. navy released its 2017 shipbuilding plan (the "2017 plan"), which anticipates a fleet of 308 ships comprised of 12 ballistic missile submarines, 11 nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, 48 nuclear-powered attack submarines, 88 large multi-mission surface combatants, 52 small multi-role surface combatants, 34 amphibious landing ships, 29 combat logistics force ships, and 34 support vessels. the 2017 plan also notes that the chief of naval operations and commandant of the marine corps have determined that the force structure required to support a 2.0 marine expeditionary brigade assault echelon is 38 amphibious ships, but due to budget pressures the 2017 plan only supported an inventory of 34 active amphibious ships. the 2017 plan also emphasized the requirement to replace submarines of the ohio class as they retire. this would require that the lead columbia class (ssbn 826) submarine be purchased in fiscal year 2021, with the second ship of the class to be purchased in fiscal year 2024, followed by funding of one columbia class (ssbn 826) submarine each year between 2026 and 2035.
in december 2016, the u.s. navy released the findings of a year-long force structure assessment that was developed to determine the right balance of existing forces, the ships currently under construction, and the future procurement plans needed to address the ever-evolving and increasingly complex threats that the navy is required to counter. notably, the force structure assessment did not present a desired force size the u.s. navy would pursue if resources were not constrained; it reflected a force level that balances warfighting risk to equipment and personnel against available resources and recommends a force size that can reasonably achieve success. accordingly, the force structure assessment reflects an objective force of 355 ships, comprised of 12 aircraft carriers, 104 large surface combatants, 52 small surface combatants, 38 amphibious warfare ships, 66 attack submarines, 12 ballistic missile submarines, 32 combat logistics ships, 10 expeditionary/high speed transports, 6 expeditionary support bases, and 23 command and support ships. it remains unclear whether the 2016 force structure assessment will have any bearing on the outcome of the new administration's assessment of readiness conditions, including training, equipment maintenance, munitions, modernization, and infrastructure, that will guide the development of a budget amendment for fiscal year 2017, as well as budget requests for fiscals years 2018 and 2019.
the shipbuilding defense industry, as characterized by its competitors, customers, suppliers, potential entrants, and substitutes, is unique in many ways. it is heavily capital and skilled labor intensive. the u.s. navy, a large single
35
customer with many needs and requirements, dominates the industry's customer base and is served by a supplier base that has trended toward exclusive providers. smaller shipyards, however, have entered the market to build the u.s. navy's littoral combat ship. the u.s. navy must compete with other national priorities, including other defense activities and entitlement programs, for a share of federal budget funding.
the dod continues to adjust its procurement practices, requirements criteria, and source selection methodology in an ongoing effort to reduce costs, gain efficiencies, and enhance program management and control. the most recent initiatives, included in the september 2014 bbp 3.0, are organized into eight major areas: achieve affordable programs; achieve dominant capabilities while controlling lifecycle costs; incentivize productivity in industry and government; incentivize innovation in industry and government; eliminate unproductive processes and bureaucracy; promote effective competition; improve tradecraft in acquisition of services; and improve the professionalism of the total acquisition workforce. while the impact to our business resulting from these initiatives remains uncertain, they could have a material impact on current programs, as well as new business opportunities with the dod. see risk factors in item 1a.
program descriptions for convenience, a brief description of certain programs discussed in this annual report on form 10-k is included in the glossary of programs.
contracts we generate most of our revenues from long-term u.s. government contracts for design, production, and support activities. government contracts typically include the following cost elements: direct material, labor and subcontracting costs, and certain indirect costs, including allowable general and administrative expenses. unless otherwise specified in a contract, costs billed to contracts with the u.s. government are treated as allowable and allocable costs under the far and cas regulations. examples of costs incurred by us that are not allowable under the far and cas regulations include certain legal costs, lobbying costs, charitable donations, interest expense, and advertising costs.
we monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions, as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations. in addition, the dcaa routinely audits the costs we incur that are allocated to contracts with the u.s. government.
our long-term contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories:
•   flexibly-priced contracts - includes both cost-type and fixed-price incentive contracts. cost-type contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor's allowable costs plus a fee that represents profit. cost-type contracts generally require that the contractor use its reasonable efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation. fixed-price incentive contracts also provide for reimbursement of the contractor's allowable costs, but are subject to a cost-share limit that affects profitability. fixed-price incentive contracts effectively become firm fixed-price contracts once the cost-share limit is reached. approximately 94%, 95%, and 94% of our revenues for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, were generated from flexibly-priced contracts, including certain fixed-price incentive contracts that have exceeded their cost-share limit.
•   firm fixed-price contracts - a firm fixed-price contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is predetermined by bid or negotiation and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor. time and materials contracts, which specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged, are considered firm fixed-price contracts. approximately 6%, 5%, and 6% of our revenues for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, were generated from firm fixed-price arrangements.
contract fees - negotiated contract fee structures for both flexibly-priced and firm fixed-price contracts include: fixed fee amounts, cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize contractors for under or over cost target performance, respectively, positive award fees, and negative penalty arrangements. profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements, percentage-of-completion of the contract, the achievement of performance objectives, and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined.
36
award fees - certain contracts contain award fees based on performance criteria such as cost, schedule, quality, and technical performance. award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of our performance against such negotiated criteria. fees that we are reasonably assured of collecting and can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract.
critical accounting policies, estimates, and judgments our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap, which requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment and estimates by management in its application. the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by our management. we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. due to the significant judgment involved in selecting certain of the assumptions used in these policies, it is possible that different parties could choose different assumptions and reach different conclusions. we consider the policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies:
•   revenue recognition;
•   purchase accounting, goodwill, and intangible assets;
•   litigation, commitments, and contingencies;
•   retirement related benefit plans; and
•   workers' compensation.
revenue recognition overview - most of our revenues are derived from long-term contracts for the production of goods and services provided to the federal government, which are accounted for in conformity with gaap for construction-type and production-type contracts and federal government contractors. we have other types of contracts, such as services and commercial arrangements, for which revenues are recognized upon delivery or as services are rendered once persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. costs related to these contracts are expensed as incurred. we classify contract revenues as product sales or service revenues depending on the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contracts. we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when determining the proper accounting method for a particular contract.
percentage-of-completion accounting - we generally recognize revenues from our long-term contracts under the cost-to-cost measure of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. the percentage-of-completion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses. for most contracts, we calculate sales based on the percentage of costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract ("eac"). for certain contracts with large up-front purchases of material, sales are calculated based on the percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to total estimated direct labor costs at completion. for certain contracts that provide for deliveries of a substantial number of similar units, sales are accounted for using units of delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completion.
the use of the percentage-of-completion method depends on our ability to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design, manufacture, and delivery of our products and services. such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years, and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment. we record sales under cost-type contracts as costs are incurred.
many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product. these incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be earned or penalties to be incurred. incentives and award fees that we are reasonably assured of collecting and can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract. incentives and award fees that we are not reasonably assured of collecting or cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded or at such time as a reasonable estimate can be made.
37
at the start of each contract, we estimate an initial profit-booking rate that considers risks related to technical requirements and feasibility, schedule, and contract costs. management then performs periodic reviews of our contracts in order to evaluate technical matters, schedule, and contract costs. during the life of a contract, the profit-booking rate may increase as we are able to retire risks in connection with technical matters, schedule, and contract costs. conversely, if we are not able to retire these risks, our eac may increase, resulting in a lower profit-booking rate.
changes in estimates of contract sales, costs, and profits are recognized using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting. this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes in current and prior periods. hence, the effect of the changes in future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimate had been the original estimate. a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts in a period could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations for that period.
for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, favorable and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were as follows:
year ended december 31
($ in millions)                 2016               2015                2014
gross favorable adjustments            $297                $304                $253
gross unfavorable adjustments           (73    )            (65    )            (31    )
net adjustments                        $224                $239                $222
for the year ended december 31, 2016, favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were primarily related to risk retirement on uss john p. murtha (lpd 26), the virginia class (ssn 774) submarine program, portland (lpd 27), the legend class nsc program, and the arleigh burke class (ddg 51) destroyer program. during the same period, unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments included lower performance on the rcoh of uss abraham lincoln (cvn 72) and construction of gerald r. ford (cvn 78), as well as other individually insignificant adjustments.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were primarily related to risk retirement on the virginia class (ssn 774) submarine program, the legend class nsc program, and the san antonio class (lpd 17) program, including delivered ships, the resolution of outstanding contract changes on the america class (lha 6) program and the rcoh of uss theodore roosevelt (cvn 71), and contract impacts of the aon litigation settlement. during the same period, unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments included lower performance on gerald r. ford (cvn 78), as well as other individually insignificant adjustments.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were primarily related to risk retirement on the virginia class (ssn 774) submarine program, the legend class nsc program, the san antonio class (lpd 17) program, including delivered lpd ships, and the construction contract for gerald r. ford (cvn 78). during the same period, none of the unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were individually significant.
cost estimation - the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers, program managers, and financial professionals. factors we consider in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability, productivity, and cost of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in performance, the availability and timing of funding from the customer, and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete. a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts in a period could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations for that period, and, where such changes occur, separate disclosure is made of the nature, underlying conditions, and financial impact of the change. we update our contract cost estimates at least annually and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances. we review and assess our cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract on a quarterly basis.
we record a provision for the entire loss on a contract in the period the loss is determined when estimates of total costs to be incurred on the contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned. we offset loss provisions first against costs that are included in unbilled accounts receivable or inventoried costs, with any remaining amount reflected in other current liabilities.
38
purchase accounting, goodwill, and intangible assets goodwill - goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. the amount of our goodwill as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, was $1,234 million and $956 million, respectively.
tests for impairment - we perform impairment tests for goodwill as of november 30 of each year, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. when testing goodwill, we first compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. if the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value, we perform a second step to estimate the fair value of goodwill, based in part on the fair value of the underlying operations. we record a charge to operations when we determine that the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value during this second step.
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of discounted cash flow analysis and market based valuation methodologies. determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgments about projected revenues, operating expenses, working capital investment, capital expenditures, and cash flows over a multi-year period. the discount rate applied to our forecasts of future cash flows is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital. in assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values, we evaluate our results against our market capitalization. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
november 30, 2016 impairment test - in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test, we tested goodwill for each of our four reporting units. as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test, we determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded by more than 10% its corresponding carrying value as of november 30, 2016.
in conjunction with the realignment of our operations on december 1, 2016, we allocated goodwill among new and realigned reporting units based on the relative fair values of the reporting units being realigned. as a result, during the fourth quarter of 2016, we performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill immediately after the realignment for each of the reporting units impacted by our realignment. based on this quantitative assessment no impairment charge was necessary as a result of the realignment.
november 30, 2015 and december 31, 2015 impairment tests - we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30, 2015, and, while the annual impairment test did not result in an impairment, considering the limited excess fair value of goodwill over its carrying value in our oil and gas reporting unit and the continued decline in oil prices and related industry activity levels, we performed an interim assessment of goodwill as of december 31, 2015. our determination of fair value as of december 31, 2015, considered industry events that occurred in the period since our annual goodwill impairment test, as well as the updated long term outlook for this reporting unit. those events included continued deterioration in the oil and gas markets, numerous industry-wide project deferrals, and capital spending cuts announced by industry leaders. the analysis concluded the fair value of this reporting unit was less than its carrying value as of december 31, 2015, and we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $16 million at our oil and gas reporting unit in our technical solutions segment in the fourth quarter of 2015. we determined that the estimated fair values of our remaining reporting units significantly exceeded their corresponding carrying values as of november 30, 2015.
may 31, 2015 impairment test - we continuously monitor industry events and changes in circumstances in the industries in which our reporting units conduct business. in consideration of the oil and gas reporting unit's sensitivity to developments within its industry, the continued decline in crude oil prices, significant reductions in its customer capital spending plans, and project delays, we concluded an interim goodwill impairment test was necessary to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of our oil and gas reporting unit was still higher than its carrying value as of may 31, 2015. our assessment considered the aforementioned changes to expectations that were considered as part of our annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30, 2014. as a result of our analysis, we recorded a $59 million goodwill impairment charge at our oil and gas reporting unit in our technical solutions segment in the second quarter of 2015.
november 30, 2014 impairment test - we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of november 30, 2014, and determined that goodwill at our oil and gas reporting unit in our technical solutions segment was
39
impaired by $47 million. the goodwill impairment charge was primarily driven by the drop in oil prices and the resulting decrease in industry market multiples. we determined that the estimated fair values of our remaining reporting units significantly exceeded their corresponding carrying values as of november 30, 2014.
other intangible assets - we perform tests for impairment of amortizable intangible assets whenever events or circumstances suggest that amortizable intangible assets may be impaired.
december 31, 2015 impairment test -  we performed an impairment test as of december 31, 2015, on the amortizable intangible assets that arose from the upi acquisition, which reside in our oil and gas reporting unit within our technical solutions segment. the oil and gas asset group's long-lived intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and, to a lesser degree, trade name and developed technology. we performed our impairment test considering the latest market conditions and expectations, as well as lower anticipated revenue and profitability. based on the nature of upi's intangible assets, we performed the recoverability test at the reporting unit level. in connection with the recoverability test, we reevaluated the remaining useful lives of the intangible assets and determined the total undiscounted pretax cash flows generated by the reporting unit over the remaining useful life of the primary asset, customer relationships. the carrying amount of the reporting unit was greater than the total undiscounted pretax cash flows, and, as a result, the intangible assets were written down by $27 million, charged against cost of sales and service revenues within income from operations at our oil and gas reporting unit in our technical solutions segment.
litigation, commitments and contingencies overview - we are subject to a range of claims, lawsuits, environmental and income tax matters, and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and the experience of management and our internal and external legal counsel. in accordance with our practices relating to accounting for contingencies, we record amounts as charges to earnings when we determine, after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter, including any settlement offers, that it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. the ultimate resolution of any such exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known.
environmental accruals - we are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct operations. we record a liability for the costs of expected environmental remediation obligations when we determine that it is probable we will incur such costs and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. when a range of costs is possible and no amount within that range is a better estimate than another, we record the minimum amount of the range.
factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability, range of estimated costs, and environmental accruals include: modification of planned remedial actions, increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate, discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated, results of efforts to involve other legally responsible parties, financial insolvency of other responsible parties, changes in laws and regulations or contractual obligations affecting remediation requirements, and improvements in remediation technology. although we cannot predict whether new information gained as remediation projects progress will materially affect the accrued liability, we do not believe that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
asset retirement obligations - we record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability's fair value can be reasonably estimated, including certain asbestos removal, asset decommissioning, and contractual lease restoration obligations. recorded amounts as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, were $19 million and $18 million, respectively, and consist primarily of obligations associated with the wind down of shipbuilding operations at our avondale facility. see note 2: summary of significant accounting policies in item 8.
we also have known conditional asset retirement obligations related to assets currently in use, such as certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future, that were not reasonably estimable as of december 31, 2016, due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation. accordingly, the fair value of these obligations has not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements. environmental remediation and/or asset decommissioning of these facilities may be required when we cease to utilize these facilities. in addition, there may be conditional environmental asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered (for example, asbestos of which we have not become aware through normal business
40
operations may exist in certain buildings), and these obligations have therefore not been included in our consolidated financial statements.
litigation accruals - litigation accruals are recorded as charges to earnings when management has determined, after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter, including any settlement offers, that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. the ultimate resolution of any exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known. based upon the information available, we believe that the resolution of any of these various claims and legal proceedings will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
uncertain tax positions - uncertain tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, based on the merits of the position, are recognized in the financial statements. we recognize the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. if a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties, we recognize an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed or expected to be claimed in our tax return. penalties and accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as a component of income tax expense. see note 13: income taxes in item 8. changes in accruals associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in earnings in the period they are determined.
retirement related benefit plans we recognize, on a plan-by-plan basis, the funded status of our retirement related benefit plans as an asset or liability on our balance sheet, with corresponding adjustments to after-tax accumulated other comprehensive income, and deferred tax assets or liabilities. the funded status represents the difference between the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. see note 18: employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8.
we calculate our retirement related benefit plan costs under both cas and u.s. gaap financial accounting standards ("fas"). the calculations under cas and fas require significant judgment. cas prescribes the determination, allocation, and recovery of retirement related benefit plan costs on u.s. government contracts through the pricing of products and services. fas outlines the methodology used to determine retirement related benefit plan expense or income, as well as the liability, for financial reporting purposes. the cas requirements for these costs and their calculation methodologies differ from fas. as a result, while both cas and fas use assumptions in their calculation methodologies, each method results in different calculated amounts of retirement related benefit plan costs.
retirement related benefit plan costs are allocated to our u.s. government contracts as allowable costs based upon cas. we recover our cas costs through the pricing of products and services on u.s. government contracts so that the cas cost is recognized in segment product sales and service revenues and in the costs of those product sales and service revenues. in order to present our consolidated financial statements in accordance with fas, we record the difference between our fas expense and cas cost ("fas/cas adjustment") as operating income (loss) within general and administrative expenses. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, our cas costs in excess of fas expenses were $145 million, $104 million, and $72 million, respectively.
the minimum funding requirements for our qualified pension plans are determined under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 ("erisa"), which is primarily based on the year's expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities. effective january 1, 2011, we were subject to the funding requirements under the pension protection act of 2006 ("ppa"), which amended erisa. under the ppa, we are required to fully fund our pension plans over a rolling seven-year period as determined annually based upon the funded status at the beginning of each year. ppa also introduced a variety of benefit restrictions that apply if a plan falls below certain funded percentages, as defined by the internal revenue code. in funding our plans, we consider various factors, including the minimum funding requirements, maintaining the funded status needed to avoid potential benefit restrictions and other adverse consequences, maintaining minimum cas funding requirements, and the current and anticipated funding levels of each plan.
during 2012, the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act ("map-21") was enacted. map-21 included provisions for potential pension relief to plan sponsors in the form of higher interest rate assumptions that were used to determine minimum funding requirements. the relief derived from these provisions was to be phased out to
41
lower levels over the next few years. the enactment of the highway and transportation funding act ("hatfa") in 2014 and bba 2015 successively provided for the continuation of higher interest rate assumptions used to determine minimum funding requirements and extended the pension relief phase-out period. we consider the effects of legislation such as map-21, hatfa, and bba 2015 in the context of current year and future projected funded status levels in deciding the level of contributions to make to our plans each year.
due to the differences in requirements and calculation methodologies between fas and cas, our fas pension expense is not necessarily indicative of the funding requirements under ppa or the amounts we recover from the u.s. government under cas.
when ppa was enacted, it was anticipated that the amounts required to be funded would exceed government contractors' recovery of those costs under cas. to remedy this cash flow misalignment, on december 27, 2011, the u.s. cost accounting standards board issued its final cas harmonization rule ("harmonization"). harmonization is intended to improve the alignment of the pension cost recovered through contract pricing under cas and the pension funding requirements under the ppa. harmonization became effective for forward pricing purposes for contracts negotiated on or after february 27, 2012. under harmonization, only contracts entered into before the effective date qualify for an equitable adjustment. price proposals for cas covered contracts awarded on or after the effective date of february 27, 2012, reflect the effects of the rule. harmonization affects pension costs on contracts over a phase-in period ending in 2017. our cas pension cost recoveries are expected to remain unaffected by the pension relief provisions offered under map-21, hatfa, and bba 2015 because of the method permitted under harmonization we use to determine the cas interest rate, which is a current market rate.
assumptions - we account for our retirement related benefit plans on the accrual basis under fas. the measurements of obligations, costs, assets, and liabilities require significant judgment. we annually review our assumptions, which are set at each year end and are generally not changed during the following year unless there is a major plan event, such as an amendment, curtailment, or settlement that would trigger a remeasurement. the key assumptions in these measurements are the interest rate used to discount future benefit payments and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
discount rate - the assumed discount rate under fas is used to determine the retirement related benefit plan obligations and expense, and represents the hypothetical rate at which the plans' benefit obligations could be effectively settled at the measurement date. consequently, the discount rate can be volatile from year to year. the discount rate assumption is determined for each plan by constructing a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows that match the estimated outflows for future benefit payments to determine a single equivalent discount rate. benefit payments are not only contingent on the terms of a plan, but also on the underlying participant demographics, including current age and assumed mortality. we use only bonds that are denominated in u.s. dollars, are rated aa or better by nationally recognized statistical rating agencies, have a minimum outstanding issue of $100 million as of the measurement date, and are not callable, convertible, or index-linked.
taking into consideration the factors noted above, our weighted average discount rate for pensions was 4.47% and 4.73% as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. our weighted average discount rate for other postretirement benefits was 4.38% and 4.58% as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
expected long-term rate of return - the expected long-term rate of return on assets is used to calculate net periodic expense, and is based on such factors as historical returns, targeted asset allocations, investment policy, duration, expected future long-term performance of individual asset classes, interest rates, inflation, portfolio volatility, investment management and administrative fees, and risk management strategies. historical plan asset performance alone has inherent limitations in predicting future returns. while studies are helpful in understanding past and current trends and performance, the assumption is based more on long-term prospective views to avoid short-term market influences. unless plan assets and benefit obligations are subject to remeasurement during the year, the expected return on pension assets is based on the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year. we used a 7.50% expected long-term rate of return assumption to record 2016 and 2015 pension expense. our 2017 expected long-term rate of return assumption is 7.25%, a decrease of 0.25% from 2016, based on our updated view of portfolio and market expectations.
mortality - mortality assumptions are used to determine the retirement related benefit obligations and expense, and represent the likelihood and duration of benefit payments to plan participants based on historical experience and projected longevity. we periodically update our mortality assumptions as circumstances warrant. if the irs publishes updated mortality tables for funding purposes, our pension contributions might be affected.
42
differences arising from actual experience or changes in assumptions might materially affect retirement related benefit plan obligations and the funded status. actuarial gains and losses arising from differences from actual experience or changes in assumptions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income. this unrecognized amount is amortized as a component of net expense to the extent it exceeds 10% of the greater of the plan's benefit obligation or plan assets. the amortization period for actuarial gains and losses is the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants. in 2016, the actual return on assets was approximately 6.9%, which was less than the expected return assumption of 7.5%. for the year ended december 31, 2016, the weighted average discount rates for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans decreased by 26 and 20 basis points, respectively. these differences in asset returns and discount rates resulted in an actuarial loss of $25 million and an actuarial loss of $241 million, respectively, as of december 31, 2016.
an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return assumptions would have had the following approximate impacts on pensions:
($ in millions)          increase (decrease) in 2017 expense        increase (decrease) in december 31, 2016 obligations
25 basis point decrease in discount rate                            $21                                                  $228
25 basis point increase in discount rate                            (20             )                                    (216                   )

25 basis point increase in expected return on assets                            (13             )
assuming a 7.25% expected return on asset assumption, a $50 million pension contribution is generally expected to favorably impact the current year expected return on assets by approximately $2 million, depending on the timing of the contribution.
sensitivities to assumptions are not necessarily linear and are specific to the time periods noted.
cas cost - in addition to providing the methodology for calculating retirement related benefit plan costs, cas also prescribes the method for assigning those costs to specific periods. while the ultimate liability for such costs under fas and cas is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. the key drivers of cas pension cost include the funded status and the method used to calculate cas reimbursement for each of our plans. a plan's cas pension cost can only be allocated until the plan is fully funded as defined under the cas requirements.
through 2013, cas required the pension interest rate to be consistent with the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, which changed infrequently given its long-term nature. as a result, short-term changes in bond or other interest rates generally did not impact cas costs. under harmonization the liability used to determine cas cost is developed by comparing the liability under the previous cas methodology and assumptions to a liability based on a discount rate derived from yields on high quality bonds. when harmonization is fully phased in, the greater of the two liabilities will be used for cas cost calculations. generally, liabilities based on a discount rate of high quality bonds will be higher than liabilities calculated prior to harmonization. the four year phase in period that will be completed in 2017 requires the use of a blend of the pre and post harmonization liabilities.
other fas and cas pension considerations - a key driver of the difference between fas expense and cas cost (and consequently the fas/cas adjustment) is the pattern of earnings and expense recognition for actuarial gains and losses that arise when our asset and liability experiences differ from our assumptions under each set of requirements. under fas, our net actuarial gains and losses exceeding the 10% corridor are amortized over the employee's average future service life of approximately 12 years. under cas, actuarial gains and losses were amortized over a 15-year period without regard to a corridor approach. under harmonization, the amortization period for cas changed to 10 years for actuarial gains and losses beginning in 2013. both fas and cas use a "market-related value" of plan assets approach to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. under cas actual asset gains and losses are systematically smoothed over five years, subject to certain limitations. for fas, we do not use this smoothing method, and instead use fair value in determining our fas expense. accordingly, fas expense generally reflects recent asset gains and losses sooner than cas.
additionally, cas cost is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded as defined under cas. if a plan becomes or ceases to be fully funded due to our asset or liability experience, our cas cost will change accordingly.
43
the fas/cas adjustment in 2016 and 2015 was a net benefit of $145 million and $104 million, respectively. the favorable change was primarily driven by the continued phase-in of harmonization. the fas/cas adjustment in 2014 was a net benefit of $72 million. the favorable change from 2014 to 2015 was driven by the phase-in of harmonization and better than expected 2014 asset returns, partially offset by higher fas expense primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2014. our projected 2017 fas/cas adjustment is discussed in consolidated operating results - operating income.
retirement plan assets - retirement plan assets are stated at fair value. investments in equity securities (common and preferred) are valued at the last reported sales price when an active market exists. investments in fixed-income securities are generally valued based on market transactions for comparable securities and various relationships between securities that are generally recognized by institutional traders. investments in hedge funds, real estate investment funds, collective trust funds, and commingled funds are generally valued at their net asset values ("nav") or equivalent, which are based on the current fair value of the fund's underlying assets.
management reviews independently appraised values, audited financial statements, and additional pricing information to evaluate the nav or its equivalent. for the limited group of investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which the above valuation procedures are deemed not to reflect fair value, additional information is obtained from the investment manager and evaluated internally to determine whether any adjustments are required to reflect fair value. see note 18: employee pension and other postretirement benefits, in item 8.
accumulated other comprehensive income - changes in assumptions and changes to plan assets and benefit obligations due to differences between actuarial assumptions and actual results are reported as actuarial gains and losses and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income along with unrecognized prior service costs arising from plan amendments. as disclosed in note 18: employee pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8, net pre-tax unrecognized actuarial losses as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 were $1,583 million and $1,412 million, respectively. the increase in these actuarial losses in 2016 was primarily driven by a decrease in the discount rates used to determine benefit obligations, which accounted for $241 million, and by 2016 actual asset returns being less than expected by $25 million, and $78 million of amortization of previously unrecognized actuarial losses.
net pre-tax unrecognized prior service costs (credits) as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 were $(18) million and $(19) million, respectively. these net deferred costs (credits) primarily originated from plan amendments, including those resulting from collective bargaining agreements. the decrease in unrecognized prior service costs (credits) in 2016 primarily resulted from amortization of previously accumulated prior service costs (credits).
workers' compensation our operations are subject to federal and state workers' compensation laws. we maintain self-insured workers' compensation plans and participate in federally administered second injury workers' compensation funds. we estimate the required liability for such claims and funding requirements on a discounted basis utilizing actuarial methods based on various assumptions, which include our historical loss experience and projected loss development factors. we periodically, and at least annually, update our assumptions based on an actuarial analysis. related self-insurance accruals include the liability for reported claims and an estimated accrual for claims incurred but not reported. our workers' compensation liability was discounted at 2.54% and 2.12% as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, based on future payment streams and a risk-free rate. we estimate a 100 basis points increase or decrease in the discount rate would change our workers' compensation liability by $(46) million and $56 million, respectively. the workers' compensation benefit obligation on an undiscounted basis was $835 million and $825 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

operating performance assessment and reporting we manage and assess the performance of our business based on our performance on individual contracts and programs using the financial measures referred to below, with consideration given to the critical accounting policies, estimates, and judgments referred to in this section. our portfolio of long-term contracts is largely flexibly-priced. therefore, sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs across our large portfolio of active contracts, with operating income being a critical measure of operating performance. under far rules that govern our business with the u.s. government, most types of costs are allowable, and we do not focus on individual cost groupings, such as cost of sales or general and administrative expenses, as much as we do on total contract costs, which are a key factor in determining contract operating income. as a result, in evaluating our operating performance, we look primarily at changes in sales and service revenues, as well as operating income, including the effects of significant changes in operating income as a result of changes in contract estimates and the use of the cumulative catch-up method of accounting in accordance with gaap. this approach is consistent with the long-term life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance in a similar manner through contract completion. consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent with our approach for managing our business.
cost of sales for both product sales and service revenues consists of materials, labor, and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs for overhead. we manage the type and amount of costs at the contract level, which is the basis for estimating our total costs at completion of our contracts. unusual fluctuations in operating performance driven by changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis.

cost of product sales
2016 - cost of product sales in 2016 increased $61 million, or 1%, compared to 2015. cost of product sales at our ingalls segment increased $194 million in 2016, primarily as a result of the impact in 2015 of the settlement of the aon litigation and the volume changes described above, partially offset by higher risk retirement in the san antonio class (lpd 17) program. cost of product sales at our newport news segment decreased $220 million in 2016, primarily as a result of the volume changes described above, partially offset by lower risk retirement in the virginia class (ssn 774) submarine program. cost of product sales at our technical solutions segment increased $87 million in 2016, primarily due to the higher volumes described above. cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales increased from 76.2% in 2015 to 77.8% in 2016, primarily driven by the impact in 2015 of the settlement of the aon litigation and lower risk retirement in the virginia class (ssn 774) submarine program, partially offset by higher risk retirement in the san antonio class (lpd 17) program.
46
2015 - cost of product sales in 2015 decreased $170 million, or 4%, compared to 2014. cost of product sales at our ingalls segment decreased $225 million in 2015, primarily due to the settlement of the aon litigation and the lower sales volumes described above. cost of product sales at our newport news segment increased $34 million in 2015, primarily due to the higher sales volumes described above and year-to-year variances in contract mix. cost of product sales at our technical solutions segment increased $21 million in 2015, primarily due to the higher sales volumes described above. cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales decreased from 78.6% in 2014 to 76.2% in 2015, primarily driven by the settlement of the aon litigation, higher performance in amphibious assault ships, and year-to-year variances in contract mix, partially offset by lower performance in aircraft carriers.
cost of service revenues
2016 - cost of service revenues in 2016 increased $30 million, or 3%, compared to 2015. cost of service revenues at our ingalls segment increased $66 million in 2016, primarily as a result of the higher sales volumes described above. cost of service revenues at our newport news segment increased $32 million in 2016, primarily as a result of the higher sales volumes described above. cost of service revenues at our technical solutions segment decreased $68 million in 2016, as a result of the intangible asset impairment charge in 2015 and the lower sales volumes described above. cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues declined from 88.4% in 2015 to 85.5% in 2016, primarily driven by the intangible asset impairment charge in 2015, improved performance in fleet support services in 2016, and year-to-year variances in contract mix.
2015 - cost of service revenues in 2015 increased $147 million, or 14%, compared to 2014. cost of service revenues at our ingalls segment increased $15 million in 2015, primarily as a result of the higher sales volumes described above. cost of service revenues at our newport news segment increased $119 million in 2015, primarily as a result of the higher sales volumes described above. cost of service revenues at our technical solutions segment increased $13 million in 2015, primarily as a result of the intangible asset impairment charge, partially offset by the lower sales volumes described above. cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues increased from 84.4% in 2014 to 88.4% in 2015, primarily driven by the intangible asset impairment charge and lower performance in oil and gas services, as well as lower performance in aircraft carriers services and year-to-year variances in contract mix.
income (loss) from operating investments, net the activities of our operating investments are closely aligned with the operations of the segments holding the investments. we therefore record income related to earnings from equity method investments in our operating income.
2016 - income from operating investments, net decreased $4 million, or 40%, to $6 million in 2016 from $10 million in 2015. the decrease resulted from lower equity income from our savannah river nuclear solutions, llc investment.
2015 - income from operating investments, net decreased $1 million, or 9%, to $10 million in 2015 from $11 million in 2014. the decrease resulted from lower equity income from our savannah river nuclear solutions, llc investment.
other income and gains
2016 - other income and gains increased $15 million in 2016 compared to 2015. the increase resulted from state and local government grants at our newport news segment.
general and administrative expenses in accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern the cost accounting requirements for government contracts, most general and administrative expenses are considered allowable and allocable costs on government contracts. these costs are allocated to contracts in progress on a systematic basis, and contract performance factors include this cost component as an element of cost.
2016 - general and administrative expenses in 2016 decreased $46 million, or 7%, compared to 2015. this decrease was primarily driven by favorable changes in the fas/cas adjustment and lower current state tax expense.
47
2015 - general and administrative expenses in 2015 decreased $57 million, or 8%, compared to 2014. this decrease was primarily the result of a favorable change in the fas/cas adjustment and lower overhead costs, offset by the inclusion of upi and higher state tax expense.
impairment of goodwill as discussed above under critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments, we perform impairment tests for goodwill as of november 30 each year, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. we record a charge to operations when we determine that an impairment has occurred.
we recorded goodwill impairment charges in 2015 and 2014 of $75 million and $47 million, respectively, in our technical solutions segment. see note 12: goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in item 8.
operating income we consider operating income to be an important measure for evaluating our operating performance, and, as is typical in the industry, we define operating income as revenues less the related cost of producing the revenues and general and administrative expenses.
we internally manage our operations by reference to "segment operating income," which is defined as operating income before the fas/cas adjustment and non-current state income taxes, neither of which affects segment performance, because neither is an allowable cost under our u.s. government contracts. segment operating income is not a recognized measure under gaap.  when analyzing our operating performance, investors should use segment operating income in addition to, and not as an alternative for, operating income or any other performance measure presented in accordance with gaap. it is a measure we use to evaluate our core operating performance.  we believe segment operating income reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our gaap results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. we believe the measure is used by investors and is a useful indicator to measure our performance. because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of segment operating income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
the following table reconciles segment operating income to operating income:

segment operating income
2016 - segment operating income in 2016 was $715 million, compared to $667 million in 2015. the increase was primarily due to the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the technical solutions segment in 2015, higher risk retirement on the san antonio class (lpd 17) program, favorable changes in overhead cost, and the receipt of a local government incentive grant, partially offset by the impact in 2015 of the settlement of the aon litigation, lower risk retirement in the virginia class (ssn 774) submarine program, and lower volume and lower risk retirement on the execution contract for the rcoh of uss abraham lincoln (cvn 72).
2015 - segment operating income in 2015 was $667 million, compared to $585 million in 2014. the increase was primarily due to the settlement of the aon litigation, higher performance and volumes in submarines, and higher performance on amphibious assault ships, partially offset by the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the technical solutions segment and lower performance on aircraft carriers.
activity within each segment is discussed under segment operating results below.

2016 - the fas/cas adjustment in 2016 was a net benefit of $145 million, compared to a net benefit of $104 million in 2015. the favorable change was primarily driven by the continued phase-in of harmonization.
2015 - the fas/cas adjustment in 2015 was a net benefit of $104 million, compared to a net benefit of $72 million in 2014. the favorable change was driven by the phase-in of harmonization and better than expected 2014 asset returns, partially offset by higher fas expense primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2014.
we expect the fas/cas adjustment in 2017 to be a net benefit of approximately $198 million ($167 million fas and $365 million cas), primarily driven by the continued phase-in of harmonization. the expected fas/cas adjustment is subject to change during 2017, when we remeasure our actuarial estimate of the unfunded benefit obligation for cas with updated census data and other items later in the year.
non-current state income taxes non-current state income taxes include deferred state income taxes, which reflect the change in deferred state tax assets and liabilities, and the tax expense or benefit associated with changes in state uncertain tax positions in the relevant period. these amounts are recorded within operating income. current period state income tax expense is charged to contract costs and included in cost of sales and service revenues in segment operating income.
2016 - non-current state income tax expense remained constant at $2 million in 2016 and 2015. deferred state income tax expense in 2016 was $8 million as compared to deferred state income tax expense of less than $1 million in 2015. the increase in deferred state income tax expense was primarily attributable to changes in the timing of contract taxable income and pension related adjustments. in 2016, the decrease in state uncertain tax positions resulted in a net tax benefit of $6 million, as compared to $2 million of tax expense in 2015. the state uncertain tax position was settled through agreement with the applicable taxing authority and was partially offset by the recognition of a non-current state tax expense in a different jurisdiction impacted by the results of the settlement. see note 13: income taxes.
2015 - the non-current state income tax expense remained constant at $2 million in 2015 and 2014. non-current state income tax expense in 2015 was primarily attributable to changes in the timing of contract taxable income and pension related adjustments, partially offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance for state tax credit carryforwards.
interest expense
2016 - interest expense in 2016 was $74 million, compared to $137 million in 2015. the decrease was primarily a result of refinancing $600 million principal amount of 7.125% senior notes with 5.000% senior notes and repayment in 2015 of credit facility term loans, as well as the loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2015. see note 14: debt in item 8.
2015 - interest expense in 2015 was $137 million, compared to $149 million in 2014. the decrease was primarily a result of refinancing $600 million principal amount of 6.875% senior notes with 5.000% senior notes and repayment in full of the term loans, partially offset by loss on early extinguishment of debt. see note 14: debt in item 8.

federal and foreign income taxes
2016 - our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 26.9% in 2016, compared to 36.1% in 2015. the decrease in our effective tax rate for 2016 was primarily attributable to the adoption of asu 2016-09, which reduced income tax expense by the income tax benefits resulting from stock award settlement activity, a re-measurement of uncertain tax positions that resulted in a decrease in cumulative unrecognized tax benefits, and the goodwill impairment that was recorded in 2015. see note 13: income taxes.
2015 - our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 36.1% in 2015, compared to 33.3% in 2014. the increase in our effective tax rate for 2015 was primarily attributable to adjustments to the domestic manufacturing deduction and an increase in the goodwill impairment that is not amortizable for tax purposes.
segment operating results basis of presentation we are aligned into three reportable segments: ingalls, newport news, and technical solutions. we established the technical solutions segment in the fourth quarter of 2016 in conjunction with our acquisition of camber and realignment of management oversight of operations to enhance strategic and operational alignment among our services businesses. as a result of this realignment, our non-nuclear fleet support and nuclear and environmental services were transferred from our newport news segment to our technical solutions segment. our oil and gas services were transferred from our other segment to our technical solutions segment, and our other segment was dissolved. we have reflected the 2016 realignment in prior reporting periods on a retrospective basis, which has resulted in the transfer of revenue, operating profit, assets, and liabilities between our technical solutions, newport news, and other segments. none of these changes impacted our previously reported consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
on december 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of camber. in 2015, we completed the acquisition of usg, and, in 2014, we completed the acquisitions of upi and sn3. we report the post-acquisition results of operations, financial position, and cash flows of camber, usg, upi, and sn3 as part of our technical solutions segment.

key segment financial measures sales and service revenues period-to-period revenues reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts. changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in terms of volume. unless otherwise described, volume generally refers to increases (or decreases) in reported revenues due to varying production activity levels, delivery rates, or service levels on individual contracts. volume changes will typically carry a corresponding income change based on the margin rate for a particular contract.
segment operating income segment operating income reflects the aggregate performance results of contracts within a segment. excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance, including the fas/cas adjustment and non-current state income taxes. changes in segment operating income are typically expressed in terms of volume, as discussed above, or performance. performance refers to changes in contract margin rates. these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to eac that reflect improved (or deteriorated) operating performance on a particular contract. operating income changes are accounted for on a cumulative to date basis at the time an eac change is recorded. segment operating income may also be affected by, among other things, contract performance, the effects of workforce stoppages, the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes, resolution of disputed items with the customer, recovery of insurance proceeds, and other discrete events. at the completion of a long-term contract, any originally estimated costs not incurred or reserves not fully utilized, such as warranty reserves, could also impact contract earnings. where such items have occurred and the effects are material, a separate description is provided.

sales and service revenues
2016 - ingalls revenues, including intersegment sales, increased $201 million, or 9%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by higher revenues in surface combatants and amphibious assault ships, partially offset by lower revenues in the legend class nsc program. surface combatants revenues increased due to higher volumes on frank e. petersen jr. (ddg 121), lenah h. sutcliffe higbee (ddg 123), and planning yard services, partially offset by lower volume on john finn (ddg 113) in connection with its delivery in 2016. the increase in amphibious assault ships revenues was due to higher volumes on fort lauderdale (lpd 28), tripoli (lha 7), and bougainville (lha 8), partially offset by lower volumes on portland (lpd 27) and uss john p. murtha (lpd 26) following its delivery in 2016. revenues on the legend class nsc program decreased due to delivery of uscgc james (nsc 5) in 2015 and lower volume on munro (nsc 6), partially offset by higher volume on midgett (nsc 8).
2015 - ingalls revenues, including intersegment sales, decreased $98 million, or 4%, in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by lower revenues in amphibious assault ships and the legend class nsc program, partially offset by higher revenues in surface combatants. the decrease in amphibious assault ships revenues was due to lower volumes on uss john p. murtha (lpd 26), portland (lpd 27), and uss america (lha 6), partially offset by higher volume on tripoli (lha 7). revenues on the legend class nsc program decreased due to lower volumes on uscgc hamilton (nsc 4) and uscgc james (nsc 5), partially offset by higher volumes on kimball (nsc 7) and midgett (nsc 8). surface combatants revenues increased due to higher volumes on delbert d. black (ddg 119) and frank e. petersen jr. (ddg 121), partially offset by lower volumes in the zumwalt class (ddg 1000) destroyer program.

segment operating income
2016 - ingalls operating income in 2016 was $321 million, compared to income of $379 million in 2015. the decrease was primarily due to the impact in 2015 of the settlement of the aon litigation and lower risk retirement on the america class (lha 6) program, partially offset by higher risk retirement on uss john p. murtha (lpd 26), portland (lpd 27), and ralph johnson (ddg 114).
2015 - ingalls operating income in 2015 was $379 million, compared to income of $229 million in 2014. the increase was primarily due to the aon litigation settlement, the resolution of outstanding contract changes and higher performance on the america class (lha 6) program, as well as higher performance on the legend class nsc program, partially offset by the lower volumes described above.

sales and service revenues
2016 - newport news revenues, including intersegment sales, decreased $209 million, or 5%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by lower revenues in aircraft carriers. aircraft carriers revenues decreased primarily as a result of lower volumes on gerald r. ford (cvn 78) and the execution contract for the rcoh of uss abraham lincoln (cvn 72), partially offset by higher volumes on john f. kennedy (cvn 79) and the advance planning contract for the rcoh of uss george washington (cvn 73). submarines revenues related to the virginia class (ssn 774) submarine program were relatively constant in 2016 compared to 2015 due to higher volumes on block iv boats and uss john warner (ssn 785) post-shakedown availability services, offset by lower volumes on block iii boats.
2015 - newport news revenues, including intersegment sales, increased $172 million, or 4%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher revenues in submarines and naval nuclear support services, partially offset by lower revenues in aircraft carriers. submarines revenues related to the virginia class (ssn 774) submarine program were higher due to higher volumes on block iv boats, partially offset by lower volumes on block iii boats. higher revenues in naval nuclear support services were primarily due to higher volumes associated with aircraft carrier support services. aircraft carrier revenues decreased due to lower volumes on the execution contract for the rcoh of uss abraham lincoln (cvn 72) and the construction contract for gerald r. ford (cvn 78), partially offset by higher volume on the construction contract for john f. kennedy (cvn 79).
segment operating income
2016 - newport news operating income in 2016 was $386 million, compared to income of $401 million in 2015. the decrease was primarily due to lower risk retirement in the virginia class (ssn 774) submarine program, lower volume and lower risk retirement on the execution contract for the rcoh of uss abraham lincoln (cvn 72) and lower volume on gerald r. ford (cvn 78), partially offset by favorable changes in overhead cost, and higher volumes on john f. kennedy (cvn 79) and the rcoh of uss george washington (cvn 73), as well as the receipt of a local government incentive grant.
2015 - newport news operating income in 2015 was $401 million, compared to income of $389 million in 2014. the increase was due to higher volumes and performance on the virginia class (ssn 774) submarine program and the resolution of outstanding contract changes on the rcoh of uss theodore roosevelt (cvn 71), partially offset by lower performance on the construction contract for gerald r. ford (cvn 78) and lower volumes in aircraft carriers rcoh programs.

sales and service revenues
2016 - technical solutions revenues, including intersegment sales, for the year ended december 31, 2016, increased $75 million, or 12%, compared to 2015, primarily due to higher nuclear and environmental and fleet support revenues, as well as the acquisition of camber, partially offset by lower revenues in oil and gas services. nuclear and environmental revenues increased due to higher volumes and the resolution of outstanding contract changes on a commercial contract, partially offset by lower volumes associated with environmental remediation programs.
2015 - technical solutions revenues, including intersegment sales, for the year ended december 31, 2015, decreased $11 million, or 2%, compared to 2014, primarily due to lower nuclear and environmental and oil and gas revenues, partially offset by higher fleet support revenues.
segment operating income
2016 - operating income in the technical solutions segment for the year ended december 31, 2016, was $8 million, compared to an operating loss of $113 million in 2015. the increase was primarily due to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in 2015 and the resolution of outstanding contract changes on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract.
2015 - operating loss in the technical solutions segment for the year ended december 31, 2015, was $113 million, compared to an operating loss of $33 million in 2014. the increased loss was primarily due to higher goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in 2015 and lower performance in oil and gas services.
backlog total backlog as of december 31, 2016, was approximately $21 billion. total backlog includes both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer). backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity orders. for contracts having no stated contract values, backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer.

awards
2016 - the value of new contract awards during the year ended december 31, 2016, was approximately $5.2 billion. significant new awards during this period included contracts for the detail design and construction of fort lauderdale (lpd 28), the construction of nsc 9 (unnamed), planning, advanced engineering, and procurement of long-lead material for bougainville (lha 8), and additional advance planning for the rcoh of uss george washington (cvn 73).
2015 - the value of new contract awards during the year ended december 31, 2015, was approximately $7.6 billion. significant new awards in 2015 included contracts for detail design and construction for john f. kennedy (cvn 79), construction of midgett (nsc 8), continued construction of gerald r. ford (cvn 78), and advance planning for the rcoh of uss george washington (cvn 73).
liquidity and capital resources we endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating results into cash for deployment in operating our businesses, implementing our business strategy, and maximizing stockholder value. we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decision making, including net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow. we believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance.
we elected to early adopt asu 2016-09, as of january 1, 2016. accordingly, income tax benefits resulting from stock award settlement activity were reported as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. prior year tax benefits were retrospectively adjusted in our consolidated statements of cash flows to conform to the current year presentation. in accordance with the new standard, we will continue to present all cash payments made to taxing authorities on behalf of employees for withheld shares as financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

cash flows we discuss below our major operating, investing, and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2016, as classified in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
54
operating activities
2016 - cash provided by operating activities was $822 million in 2016, compared to $861 million in 2015. the decrease of $39 million in operating cash flow was primarily due to higher funding of retiree benefit plans, a change in trade working capital, and the impact in 2015 of the settlement of the aon litigation. the change in trade working capital was primarily driven by accounts receivable and accounts payable due to timing of receipts and payments, respectively.
we expect cash generated from operations in 2017, in combination with our current cash and cash equivalents, as well as existing credit facilities, to be sufficient to service debt and retiree benefit plans, meet contractual obligations, and finance capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.
2015 - cash provided by operating activities was $861 million in 2015, compared to $755 million in 2014. the favorable change of $106 million in operating cash flow was primarily due to proceeds from the aon litigation settlement and a change in funding of retiree benefit plans, partially offset by higher payments for income taxes and a change in trade working capital. the change in trade working capital was primarily driven by accounts receivable and accounts payable due to timing of receipts and payments, respectively.
investing activities
2016 - cash used in investing activities was $653 million in 2016, an increase of $512 million from 2015. the change in investing cash flow was driven by the acquisition of camber in 2016, higher capital expenditures in 2016, the sale of the gulfport composite center of excellence in march 2015, and proceeds in 2015 from the aon litigation settlement.
for 2017, we expect our capital expenditures for maintenance and sustainment to be approximately 2.0% to 2.5% of annual revenues and our discretionary capital expenditures to be approximately 2.5% to 3.0% of annual revenues.
2015 - cash used in investing activities was $141 million in 2015, a decrease of $296 million from 2014. the favorable change in investing cash flow was driven by the 2014 acquisitions of upi and sn3, the sale of the gulfport composite center of excellence in march 2015, and proceeds from the aon litigation settlement.
financing activities
2016 - cash used in financing activities in 2016 was $343 million, compared to $816 million used in 2015. the change was primarily due to decreases of $449 million of debt related expenditures, $38 million of common stock repurchases, and $3 million in employee tax withholdings on share-based payment arrangements, partially offset by an additional $17 million of cash dividend payments in 2016 compared to 2015.
2015 - cash used in financing activities in 2015 was $816 million, compared to $371 million used in 2014. the increase was primarily due to an additional $316 million of long-term debt repayment, $94 million of repurchases of common stock, $32 million of cash dividend payments, $11 million of debt related expenditures, as well as a $6 million decrease in excess tax benefit related to stock based compensation and a $2 million decrease in proceeds from stock options exercised.
free cash flow free cash flow represents cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. free cash flow is not a measure recognized under gaap. free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under gaap. we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for our investors because it provides them insight into our current and period-to-period performance and our ability to generate cash from continuing operations. we also use free cash flow as a key operating metric in assessing the performance of our business and as a key performance measure in evaluating management performance and determining incentive compensation. free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

2016 - free cash flow decreased $136 million from 2015, primarily due to capital expenditures, higher funding of retiree benefit plans, a change in trade working capital, and the impact in 2015 of the settlement of the aon litigation.
2015 - free cash flow increased $83 million from 2014, primarily due to proceeds from the aon litigation settlement and a change in funding of retiree benefit plans, partially offset by higher payments for income taxes, capital expenditures, and a change in trade working capital.
retirement related benefit plan contributions erisa, including amendments under pension relief, defines the minimum amount that must be contributed to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. in determining whether to make discretionary contributions to these plans above the minimum required amounts, we consider various factors, including maintaining the funded status needed to avoid potential benefit restrictions and other adverse consequences, maintaining minimum cas funding requirements, and the current and anticipated future funding levels of each plan. the contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans are affected by a number of factors, including published irs interest rates, the actual return on plan assets, actuarial assumptions, and demographic experience. these factors and our resulting contributions also impact the plans' funded statuses. if the irs publishes updated mortality tables for funding purposes, our pension contributions could be affected. we made the following minimum and discretionary contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans in the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:

we made discretionary contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans totaling $167 million, $99 million, and $123 million in the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, our qualified pension plans were funded 83% and 84%, respectively, on a fas basis. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, these plans were sufficiently funded on an erisa basis so as not to be subject to benefit payment restrictions. the funded percentages under erisa and fas vary due to inherent differences in the assumptions and methodologies used to develop respective obligations for these two different purposes. we expect our 2017 cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans to be $290 million, all of which we anticipate will be discretionary and are exclusive of cas cost recoveries in our contracts. due to the differences in calculation methodologies, our fas expense is not necessarily representative of our funding requirements or cas cost recoveries.
other postretirement benefit contributions were $32 million, $33 million, and $33 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. we expect our 2017 contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans to be approximately $37 million, which are exclusive of cas cost recoveries in our contracts. contributions for postretirement benefits are

(1)   a "purchase obligation" is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. these amounts are primarily comprised of open purchase order commitments to vendors and subcontractors pertaining to funded contracts.
(2)   other long-term liabilities primarily consist of total accrued workers' compensation reserves, deferred compensation, and other miscellaneous liabilities, of which $217 million is the current portion of workers' compensation liabilities. it excludes obligations for uncertain tax positions of $3 million, for which the timing of the payments, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated.
the above table excludes retirement related contributions. amounts for retirement related contributions depend on plan provisions, actuarial assumptions, actual plan asset performance, and other factors described above under retirement related benefit plans under critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments and under liquidity and capital resources.

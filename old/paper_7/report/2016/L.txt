overview we are a holding company and have five reportable segments comprised of our four individual operating subsidiaries, cna financial corporation (cna), diamond offshore drilling, inc. (diamond offshore), boardwalk pipeline partners, lp (boardwalk pipeline) and loews hotels holding corporation (loews hotels); and our corporate segment. each of our operating subsidiaries is headed by a chief executive officer who is responsible for the operation of its business and has the duties and authority commensurate with that position.
we rely upon our invested cash balances and distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations and to declare and pay any dividends to our shareholders. the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to, among other things, the availability of sufficient earnings and funds in such subsidiaries, applicable state laws, including in the case of the insurance subsidiaries of cna, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by regulated insurance companies (see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8) and compliance with covenants in their respective loan agreements. claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and those of our creditors and shareholders.
unless the context otherwise requires, references in this report to loews corporation, the company, parent company, we, our, us or like terms refer to the business of loews corporation excluding its subsidiaries.
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item 1a, risk factors, and item 8, financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k.

2016 compared with 2015
consolidated net income attributable to loews corporation for 2016 was $654 million, or $1.93 per share, compared to $260 million, or $0.72 per share, in 2015.
net income for 2016 included asset impairment charges of $267 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) at diamond offshore. in 2015, net income included asset impairment charges at diamond offshore of $341 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) and a reserve charge of $177 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to the long term care business at cna.
50
net income attributable to loews corporation in 2016 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the impact of the reserve charge at cna in 2015 and the asset impairment charges at diamond offshore which were lower in 2016 compared to 2015. absent these charges, net income increased $143 million due to higher earnings at cna and boardwalk pipeline and improved results from the parent company investment portfolio. these increases were partially offset by lower earnings at diamond offshore.
2015 compared to 2014
consolidated net income attributable to loews corporation for 2015 was $260 million, or $0.72 per share, compared to $591 million, or $1.55 per share, in 2014. net income in 2014 included discontinued operations reflecting the sale of highmount exploration & production, llc and cnas former life insurance subsidiary.
income from continuing operations for 2015 was $260 million, or $0.72 per share, compared to $962 million, or $2.52 per share, in 2014. the decline in income from continuing operations was primarily due to a reserve charge at cna related to the long term care business, asset impairment charges at diamond offshore and lower results from the parent company investment portfolio.
unless the context otherwise requires, references to net operating income (loss), net realized investment results and net income (loss) reflect amounts attributable to loews corporation shareholders.

2016 compared with 2015
income from continuing operations increased $380 million in 2016 as compared with 2015, primarily as a result of a $305 million ($177 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) charge in 2015 related to increasing long term care active life and claim reserves. as the active life reserve assumptions were unlocked in 2015, long term care
51
results in 2016 improved significantly. results in 2016 also reflect favorable net prior year development of $314 million as compared to $218 million recorded in 2015. further information on net prior year development is included in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item 8. in addition, net investment income increased $148 million and investment results improved $133 million in 2016 as compared with 2015, driven by improved limited partnership investments and fixed maturity securities income, lower other-than-temporary impairment (otti) losses recognized in earnings and higher net realized investment gains on sales of securities. these increases were partially offset by an increase in the current accident year loss ratio and higher underwriting expenses.
2015 compared with 2014
income from continuing operations decreased $411 million in 2015 as compared with 2014. results in 2015 were negatively impacted by a $305 million ($177 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) charge related to recognition of a premium deficiency and a small deficiency in claim reserves in cnas long term care business as further discussed in the insurance reserves section of this md&a. in addition, results in 2015 decreased $78 million ($46 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) as compared to 2014 as a result of the application of retroactive reinsurance accounting to adverse reserve development ceded under the 2010 asbestos and environmental pollution (a&ep) loss portfolio transfer, as further discussed in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8. in addition, results in 2015 as compared with 2014 included lower net investment income and investment losses driven by lower limited partnership results and higher otti losses, partially offset by improved underwriting results. results in 2014 were impacted by a $31 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) loss on a coinsurance transaction related to the sale of cnas former life insurance subsidiary.
cnas core and non-core operations cnas core business is its property and casualty insurance operations that include its specialty, commercial and international lines of business. cnas non-core operations include its long term care business that is in run-off, certain corporate expenses, including interest on cnas corporate debt, and certain property and casualty businesses in run-off, including cna re and a&ep. cnas products and services are primarily marketed through independent agents, brokers and managing general underwriters to a wide variety of customers, including small, medium and large businesses, insurance companies, associations, professionals and other groups. we believe the presentation of cna as one reportable segment is appropriate in accordance with applicable accounting standards on segment reporting. however, for purposes of this discussion and analysis of the results of operations, we provide greater detail with respect to cnas core and non-core operations to enhance the readers understanding and to provide further transparency into key drivers of cnas financial results.
in assessing cnas insurance operations, the company utilizes the net operating income (loss) financial measure. net operating income (loss) is calculated by excluding from net income (loss) the after tax and noncontrolling interests effects of (i) net realized investment gains or losses, (ii) income or loss from discontinued operations and (iii) any cumulative effects of changes in accounting guidance. the calculation of net operating income excludes net realized investment gains or losses because net realized investment gains or losses are largely discretionary, except for some losses related to otti, and are generally driven by economic factors that are not necessarily consistent with key drivers of underwriting performance, and are therefore not considered an indication of trends in insurance operations. net operating income (loss) is deemed to be a non-gaap financial measure and management believes this measure is useful to investors as management uses this measure to assess financial performance.
property and casualty operations in evaluating the results of the property and casualty operations, cna utilizes the loss ratio, the expense ratio, the dividend ratio and the combined ratio. these ratios are calculated using gaap financial results. the loss ratio is the percentage of net incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses to net earned premiums. the expense ratio is the percentage of insurance underwriting and acquisition expenses, including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, to net earned premiums. the dividend ratio is the ratio of policyholders dividends incurred to net earned premiums. the combined ratio is the sum of the loss, expense and dividend ratios. in addition, cna also utilizes rate, retention and new business in evaluating operating trends. rate represents the average change in price on policies that renew excluding exposure change. retention represents the percentage of premium dollars renewed in
52
comparison to the expiring premium dollars from policies available to renew. new business represents premiums from policies written with new customers and additional policies written with existing customers.

2016 compared with 2015
net written premiums increased $21 million in 2016 as compared with 2015. net written premiums for commercial increased $23 million in 2016 as compared with 2015, driven by strong retention in middle markets, partially offset by a decrease in small business, which included a premium rate adjustment, as discussed in note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item 8. net written premiums for specialty in 2016 were consistent with 2015 as growth in warranty was offset by a decrease in management and professional liability and health care due to underwriting actions undertaken in certain business lines. net written premiums for international in 2016 were consistent with 2015 and include favorable period over period premium development of $24 million. excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates and premium development, net written premiums increased 1.4% in 2016 in international. the increase in net earned premiums was consistent with the trend in net written premiums in commercial. excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates and premium development, the increase in net earned premiums was consistent with the trend in net written premiums in international.
net operating income increased $15 million in 2016 as compared with 2015. the increase in net operating income was primarily due to higher favorable net prior year reserve development and net investment income, partially offset by an increase in the current accident year loss ratio and higher underwriting expenses. catastrophe losses were $100 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2016 as compared to catastrophe losses of $85 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2015.
favorable net prior year development of $316 million and $218 million was recorded in 2016 and 2015. specialty recorded favorable net prior year development of $305 million and $152 million in 2016 and 2015, commercial recorded unfavorable net prior year development of $53 million in 2016 as compared with favorable net prior year development of $30 million in 2015 and international recorded favorable net prior year development of $64 million and $36 million in 2016 and 2015. further information on net prior year development is included in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
specialtys combined ratio decreased 3.7 points in 2016 as compared with 2015. the loss ratio decreased 4.6 points due to higher favorable net prior year reserve development, partially offset by a higher current accident year loss ratio. specialtys expense ratio increased 0.9 points in 2016 as compared with 2015 due to higher employee costs and higher information technology (it) spending primarily related to new underwriting platforms.
54
commercials combined ratio increased 4.3 points in 2016 as compared with 2015. the loss ratio increased 3.6 points due to the unfavorable period over period effect of net prior year reserve development and a higher current accident year loss ratio due to higher large losses. commercials expense ratio increased 0.7 points in 2016 as compared with 2015 due to higher employee costs and higher it spending primarily related to a new underwriting platform.
internationals combined ratio increased 1.5 points in 2016 as compared with 2015. the loss ratio increased 1.5 points, primarily due to an increase in the current accident year loss ratio driven by a higher level of large losses related to political risk, property and financial institutions, partially offset by higher favorable net prior year development. internationals expense ratio was consistent with 2015.
2015 compared with 2014
net written premiums decreased $115 million in 2015 as compared with 2014. this decrease was driven by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates, the 2014 termination of a specialty product managing general underwriter relationship in canada and unfavorable premium development at hardy, all in international, lower new business in specialty and the residual effect of previous underwriting actions undertaken in certain business classes, offset by positive rate, higher retention and new business in commercial. net earned premiums decreased $283 million in 2015 as compared with 2014, consistent with the trend in net written premiums.
net operating income decreased $42 million in 2015 as compared with 2014. the decrease in net operating income was due to lower net investment income and less favorable underwriting results in international, partially offset by improved underwriting results in commercial. catastrophe losses were $85 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2015 as compared to catastrophe losses of $92 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2014.
favorable net prior year development of $218 million and $50 million was recorded in 2015 and 2014. specialty recorded favorable net prior year development of $152 million and $149 million in 2015 and 2014, commercial recorded favorable net prior year development of $30 million in 2015 as compared with unfavorable net prior year development of $156 million in 2014 and international recorded favorable net prior year development of $36 million and $57 million in 2015 and 2014. further information on net prior year development is included in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
specialtys combined ratio increased 1.1 points in 2015 as compared with 2014. the loss ratio increased 0.1 point due to deterioration in the current accident year loss ratio, primarily offset by higher net favorable prior year development. specialtys expense ratio increased 1.0 point in 2015 as compared with 2014, driven by increased underwriting expenses and the unfavorable effect of lower net earned premiums.
commercials combined ratio improved 7.8 points in 2015 as compared with 2014. the loss ratio improved 10.2 points, due to favorable net prior year development for 2015 as compared to unfavorable net prior year development for 2014 and an improved current accident year loss ratio. commercials expense ratio increased 2.4 points in 2015 as compared with 2014, due to higher expenses including increased commissions, the favorable impact in 2014 of recoveries on insurance receivables written off in prior years and the unfavorable effect of lower net earned premiums.
internationals combined ratio increased 5.2 points in 2015 as compared with 2014. the loss ratio increased 6.0 points, primarily due to less favorable net prior year development and an increase in the current accident year loss ratio driven by large losses. internationals expense ratio improved 0.8 points as compared with 2014, due to lower expenses, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of lower net earned premiums.

2016 compared with 2015
net loss from continuing operations decreased $262 million in 2016 as compared to 2015. in 2015, cna recognized a $177 million (after-tax and noncontrolling interests) charge relating to a premium deficiency and claim reserve strengthening in its long term care business. the december 31, 2015 gross premium valuation (gpv) indicated a premium deficiency of $296 million. the indicated premium deficiency necessitated a charge to income that was effected by the write off of the entire long term care deferred acquisition cost of $289 million and an increase to active life reserves of $7 million. due to the recognition of the premium deficiency and resetting of actuarial assumptions in the fourth quarter of 2015, the operating results of cnas long term care business in 2016 reflect the variance between actual experience and the expected results contemplated in its best estimate reserves.
in 2016, the long term care business recorded net operating income of $18 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests), driven by a favorable release of claim reserves resulting from the annual claims experience study and higher net investment income due to an increase in the invested asset base. the long term care results were generally in line with expectations, as the impact of favorable morbidity was partially offset by unfavorable persistency. in 2015, results of cnas long term care business reflected variances between actual experience and actuarial assumptions that were locked-in at policy issuance. as a result of the reserve assumption unlocking, the 2016 and 2015 results are not comparable. for further discussion of the gpv and premium deficiency, see the insurance reserves section of this md&a.
results in 2016 and 2015 were also negatively affected by $74 million and $49 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) charges related to the application of retroactive reinsurance accounting to adverse reserve development ceded under the 2010 a&ep loss portfolio transfer, as further discussed in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
2015 compared with 2014
net loss from continuing operations increased $264 million in 2015 as compared with 2014 driven by the $177 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) charge related to recognition of a premium deficiency and claim reserve strengthening in cnas long term care business, discussed above. excluding the effects of this item, results in 2015 were also negatively affected by higher morbidity in cnas long term care business. results in 2014 were negatively affected by a $31 million loss (after tax and noncontrolling interests) on a coinsurance transaction related to the sale of cnas former life insurance subsidiary.
results in 2015 were also negatively impacted by an increase in gross a&ep claim reserves. while all of this reserve development is reinsured under the loss portfolio transfer, only a portion of the reinsurance recovery is currently recognized because of the application of retroactive reinsurance accounting. as a result, a charge of $84 million ($49 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) was recorded in 2015, as further discussed in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8. additionally, results in 2015 benefited from lower interest expense due to the maturity of higher coupon debt in the fourth quarter of 2014.

referendum on the united kingdoms membership in the european union on june 23, 2016, the united kingdom (u.k.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union (e.u.), commonly referred to as brexit. as a result of the referendum, it is currently expected that the british government will formally commence the process to leave the e.u. and begin negotiating the terms of treaties that will govern the u.k.s future relationship with the e.u. in the first quarter of 2017. although the terms of any future treaties are unknown, changes in cnas international operating platform may be required to allow cna to continue to write business in the e.u. after the completion of brexit. as a result of these changes, the complexity and cost of regulatory compliance of cnas european business is likely to increase.
diamond offshore overview oil prices, which had fallen to a 12-year low of less than $30 per barrel in january of 2016, rebounded to some extent into the low-to-mid-$50s per barrel range by the end of january of 2017, in part due to expectations that an agreement to cut production by certain members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec) and others that went into effect in 2017 would reduce the oversupply of oil and raise and potentially stabilize oil prices. to date, however, oil prices have continued to exhibit volatility due to multiple factors, including fluctuations in the current and expected level of global oil inventories and estimates of global demand. despite the recent rise in oil prices and announcements by a few customers of planned increases in capital spending in 2017, diamond offshore expects that overall capital spending for offshore exploration and development in 2017 will be lower than 2016 levels. as a consequence, the offshore contract drilling industry remains weak.
industry analysts have reported that in 2016, for the second consecutive year, the global supply of floater rigs decreased with 24 floaters being scrapped during the year. in addition, many drilling rigs across all water depth categories were cold stacked in 2016. despite these events, the oversupply of drilling rigs in the floater markets continues to persist. industry reports indicate that only three newbuild floaters were delivered in 2016; however, there are approximately 40 newbuild floaters scheduled for delivery between 2017 and 2021. industry analysts predict that these delivery dates may extend further as newbuild owners negotiate with their respective shipyards.
given the oversupply of rigs, competition for the limited number of offshore drilling jobs continues to be intense. in some cases, dayrates have been negotiated at break-even or below-cost levels in order to enable the drilling contractor to recover a portion of operating costs for rigs that would otherwise be uncontracted or cold stacked. in addition, customers have indicated a preference for hot rigs rather than reactivated cold-stacked rigs. this preference incentivizes the drilling contractor to contract rigs at lower rates for the sole purpose of maintaining the rigs in an active state and allowing for at least partial cost recovery. industry analysts have predicted that the offshore contract drilling market will remain depressed through 2017.
as a result of the continuing depressed market conditions in the offshore drilling industry and continued pessimistic outlook for the near term, certain of diamond offshores customers, as well as those of its competitors, have attempted to renegotiate or terminate existing drilling contracts. such renegotiations have included requests to lower the contract dayrate in some cases in exchange for additional contract term, shorten the term on one contracted rig in exchange for additional term on another rig, to early terminate a contract in exchange for a lump sum payout and other requests. in addition to the potential for renegotiations, some of diamond offshores drilling contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract early after specified notice periods, usually resulting in a requirement for the customer to pay a contractually specified termination amount, which may not fully compensate diamond offshore for the loss of the contract. as a result of these depressed market conditions, some customers have also utilized such contract clauses to seek to renegotiate or terminate a drilling contract or claim that diamond offshore has breached provisions of its drilling contracts in order to avoid their obligations to diamond offshore under circumstances where diamond offshore believes it is in compliance with the contracts.
57
particularly during depressed market conditions, the early termination of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time, which could adversely affect diamond offshores business. when a customer terminates a contract prior to the contracts scheduled expiration, diamond offshores contract backlog is also adversely impacted.
diamond offshores results of operations and cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 have been materially impacted by depressed market conditions in the offshore drilling industry. diamond offshore currently expects that these adverse market conditions will continue for the foreseeable future. the continuation of these conditions for an extended period could result in more of diamond offshores rigs being without contracts and/or cold stacked or scrapped and could further materially and adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. when diamond offshore cold stacks or elects to scrap a rig, it evaluates the rig for impairment. during 2016, diamond offshore recognized an aggregate impairment loss of $680 million, related to eight of its drilling rigs and related spare parts and supplies. during 2015, diamond offshore recognized an aggregate impairment loss of $861 million related to 17 of its drilling rigs.
historically, the longer a drilling rig remains cold stacked, the higher the cost of reactivation and, depending on the age, technological obsolescence and condition of the rig, the lower the likelihood that the rig will be reactivated at a future date. as of january 30, 2017, ten rigs in diamond offshores fleet were cold stacked.
contract drilling backlog diamond offshores contract drilling backlog was $3.6 billion, $4.1 billion and $5.2 billion as of january 1, 2017 (based on contract information known at that time), october 1, 2016 (the date reported in our quarterly report on form 10-q for the quarter ended september 30, 2016) and february 16, 2016 (the date reported in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2015). the contract drilling backlog by year as of january 1, 2017 is $1.5 billion in 2017, $1.1 billion in 2018, $0.8 billion in 2019 and $0.2 billion in 2020. contract drilling backlog includes $158 million, $158 million, $150 million and $6 million for 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 attributable to the ocean greatwhite, which reflects a revised standby rate that allows diamond offshore to pass along certain cost savings to its customer while maintaining approximately the same operating margin and cash flows as the original contract and $149 million and $119 million for 2017 and 2018 attributable to contracted work for the ocean valor under a contract that petróleo brasileiro s.a. (petrobras) has attempted to terminate and is currently in effect pursuant to an injunction granted by a brazilian court, which petrobras has appealed.
contract drilling backlog includes only firm commitments (typically represented by signed contracts) and is calculated by multiplying the contracted operating dayrate by the firm contract period. diamond offshores calculation also assumes full utilization of its drilling equipment for the contract period (excluding scheduled shipyard and survey days); however, the amount of actual revenue earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different than the amounts and periods stated above due to various factors affecting utilization such as weather conditions and unscheduled repairs and maintenance. contract drilling backlog excludes revenues for mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation and customer reimbursables. changes in diamond offshores contract drilling backlog between periods are generally a function of the performance of work on term contracts, as well as the extension or modification of existing term contracts and the execution of additional contracts. in addition, under certain circumstances, diamond offshores customers may seek to terminate or renegotiate its contracts, which could adversely affect its reported backlog.
results of operations diamond offshores pretax income (loss) is primarily a function of contract drilling revenue earned less contract drilling expenses incurred or recognized. the two most significant variables affecting diamond offshores contract drilling revenues are dayrates earned and rig utilization rates achieved by its rigs, each of which is a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace. revenues can also be affected as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs, rig mobilizations, required surveys and shipyard projects.
58
operating expenses represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of diamond offshores drilling equipment. the principal components of diamond offshores operating costs are, among other things, direct and indirect costs of labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance, freight, regulatory inspections, boat and helicopter rentals and insurance.

2016 compared with 2015
contract drilling revenue decreased $835 million in 2016 as compared with 2015 due to continued depressed market conditions in all floater markets and for the jack-up rig. the decrease in contract drilling revenues for ultra-deepwater and deepwater floater fleets was primarily due to currently cold stacked rigs that had operated in 2015, lower amortized mobilization and contract preparation fees and lower dayrates earned by the ocean valiant and ocean apex. the decrease in contract drilling revenues for the mid-water and jack-up fleets was primarily due to fewer mid-water floaters operating under contract in 2016 compared to 2015 and the early contract termination for the ocean scepter in 2016, which is expected to commence operations offshore mexico in the first quarter of 2017. these decreases were partially offset by the favorable settlement of a contractual dispute of $36 million and receipt of loss-of-hire insurance proceeds in 2016.
contract drilling expense decreased $456 million in 2016 as compared with 2015, reflecting diamond offshores lower cost structure due to additional rigs idled, cold stacked or retired during 2015 and 2016, as well as the favorable impact of cost control initiatives. asset impairment charges decreased $201 million as compared with the prior year. as a result of the impairment charges in 2015 and 2016 and resulting lower depreciable asset base, depreciation expense decreased $111 million in 2016 as compared to 2015.
net results decreased $30 million in 2016 as compared with 2015, primarily due to lower utilization of the rig fleet, which reduced both contract drilling revenue and expense for the year. results for 2016 also reflected an aggregate impairment charge of $267 million (after taxes and noncontrolling interests) compared to impairment charges aggregating $341 million (after taxes and noncontrolling interests) in 2015. in addition, during 2016, diamond offshore sold its investment in privately-held corporate bonds for a total recognized loss of $12 million ($4 million after tax and noncontrolling interests). the lower results were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense, recognition of $40 million in demobilization revenue and $15 million in net reimbursable revenue related to the ocean endeavors demobilization from the black sea and the absence of a $20 million
59
impairment charge in 2015 to write-off all goodwill associated with the companys investment in diamond offshore. in addition, results in 2016 were favorably impacted by a $43 million tax adjustment primarily related to diamond offshores egyptian liability for uncertain tax positions related to the devaluation of the egyptian pound.
2015 compared with 2014
contract drilling revenue decreased $377 million in 2015 as compared with 2014, primarily due to a decrease in revenue earned by both the mid-water and jack-up fleets, partially offset by an increase in revenue earned by both the ultra-deepwater and deepwater floaters. the decrease in contract drilling revenue was primarily due to cold stacking, rig sales and incremental downtime between contracts for several rigs. during 2015, twelve mid-water rigs were cold stacked or retired and five jack-up rigs were cold stacked and marketed for sale. these decreases were partially offset by increased incremental revenue earning days for newly constructed ultra-deepwater floaters and upgraded or enhanced rigs. in addition, during 2015, four deepwater floaters returned to operation after prolonged periods of nonproductive time for planned upgrades and surveys, as well as warm-stacking between contracts.
contract drilling expense decreased $296 million in 2015 as compared with 2014, primarily due to lower rig utilization, combined with efforts to control costs. this decrease in expenses was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense due to a higher depreciable asset base in 2015, including the ocean apex and two drillships, which were placed in service in december of 2014, partially offset by the absence of depreciation for certain rigs that were impaired or sold during late 2014 and in 2015.
a net loss of $156 million in 2015 and net income of $183 million in 2014 resulted in a change of $339 million due to the impact of a $341 million asset impairment charge (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2015 related to the carrying value of 17 drilling rigs, as compared to the prior year when diamond offshore recorded a $55 million asset impairment charge (after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to the carrying values of six drilling rigs. results in 2015 also include the recognition of a $20 million impairment charge to write off all goodwill associated with the companys investment in diamond offshore as well as higher depreciation and interest expense.
boardwalk pipeline overview boardwalk pipeline derives revenues primarily from the transportation and storage of natural gas and natural gas liquids (ngls). transportation services consist of firm natural gas transportation, where the customer pays a capacity reservation charge to reserve pipeline capacity at receipt and delivery points along pipeline systems, plus a commodity and fuel charge on the volume of natural gas actually transported, and interruptible natural gas transportation, under which the customer pays to transport gas only when capacity is available and used. the transportation rates boardwalk pipeline is able to charge customers are heavily influenced by market trends (both short and longer term), including the available natural gas supplies, geographical location of natural gas production, the demand for gas by end-users such as power plants, petrochemical facilities and liquefied natural gas (lng) export facilities and the price differentials between the gas supplies and the market demand for the gas (basis differentials). rates for short term firm and interruptible transportation services are influenced by shorter term market conditions such as current and forecasted weather.
boardwalk pipeline offers firm natural gas storage services in which the customer reserves and pays for a specific amount of storage capacity, including injection and withdrawal rights, and interruptible storage and parking and lending (pal) services where the customer receives and pays for capacity only when it is available and used. the value of boardwalk pipelines storage and pal services (comprised of parking gas for customers and/or lending gas to customers) is affected by natural gas price differentials between time periods, such as between winter and summer (time period price spreads), price volatility of natural gas and other factors. boardwalk pipelines storage and parking services have greater value when the natural gas futures market is in contango (a positive time period price spread, meaning that current price quotes for delivery of natural gas further in the future are higher than in the nearer term), while its lending service has greater value when the futures market is backwardated (a negative time period price spread, meaning that current price quotes for delivery of natural gas in the nearer term are higher than further in the future). the value of both storage and pal services may also be favorably impacted by increased volatility in the price of natural gas, which allows boardwalk pipeline to optimize the value of its storage and pal capacity.
60
boardwalk pipeline also transports and stores ngls. contracts for boardwalk pipelines ngls services are generally fee based or based on minimum volume requirements, while others are dependent on actual volumes transported. boardwalk pipelines ngls storage rates are market-based and contracts are typically fixed price arrangements with escalation clauses. boardwalk pipeline is not in the business of buying and selling natural gas and ngls other than for system management purposes, but changes in natural gas and ngls prices may impact the volumes of natural gas or ngls transported and stored by customers on its systems. due to the capital intensive nature of its business, boardwalk pipelines operating costs and expenses typically do not vary significantly based upon the amount of products transported, with the exception of fuel consumed at its compressor stations and not included in a fuel tracker.
firm transportation agreements a substantial portion of boardwalk pipelines transportation capacity is contracted for under firm transportation agreements. actual revenues recognized from capacity reservation and minimum bill charges in 2016 were $1.0 billion. approximate projected revenues from capacity reservation and minimum bill charges under committed firm transportation agreements in place as of december 31, 2016 are $1.1 billion for 2017 and $975 million for 2018. the amounts for 2016 and 2017 increased approximately $13 million and $25 million from what was reported in our 2015 form 10-k. the increase in each year is primarily due to contract renewals and new contracts that were entered into during 2016. additional revenues boardwalk pipeline has recognized and may receive under firm transportation agreements based on actual utilization of the contracted pipeline capacity, any expected revenues for periods after the expiration dates of the existing agreements, execution of precedent agreements associated with growth projects or other events that occurred or will occur subsequent to december 31, 2016 are not included in these amounts.
each year a portion of boardwalk pipelines firm transportation agreements expire and need to be renewed or replaced. in the 2018 to 2020 timeframe, the agreements associated with the east texas pipeline, southeast expansion, gulf crossing pipeline and fayetteville and greenville laterals, which were placed into service in 2008 and 2009, will expire. these projects were large, new pipeline expansions, developed to serve growing production in texas, oklahoma, arkansas and louisiana and anchored primarily by 10-year firm transportation agreements with producers. since boardwalk pipelines expansion projects went into service, gas production from the utica and marcellus area in the northeast has grown significantly and has altered the flow patterns of natural gas in north america. over the last few years, gas production from other basins such as barnett and fayetteville, which primarily supported two of boardwalk pipelines expansions, has declined because the production economics in those basins are not as competitive as other production basins, such as utica and marcellus. these market dynamics have resulted in less production from certain basins tied to boardwalk pipelines system and a narrowing of basis differentials across portions of its pipeline systems, primarily for capacity associated with natural gas flows from west to east. boardwalk pipeline expects that the total revenues generated from the expansion projects capacity could be materially lower when these contracts expire.
boardwalk pipelines marketing efforts are focused on enhancing the value of this expansion capacity. boardwalk pipeline is working with customers to match gas supplies from various basins to new and existing customers and markets, including aggregating supplies at key locations along its pipelines to provide end-use customers with attractive and diverse supply options.
partially as a result of the increase in overall gas supplies, demand markets, primarily in the gulf coast area, are growing due to new natural gas export facilities, power plants and petrochemical facilities and increased exports to mexico. these developments have resulted in significant growth projects for boardwalk pipeline. boardwalk pipeline placed into service approximately $320 million of growth projects in 2016, and have an additional $1.3 billion of growth projects under development that are expected to be placed into service in 2017 and 2018. these new projects have lengthy planning and construction periods and, as a result, will not contribute to boardwalk pipelines earnings and cash flows until they are placed into service over the next several years. the revenues generated that are expected to be realized in 2017 and 2018 from these projects are included in the amounts above.
61
pipeline system maintenance boardwalk pipeline incurs substantial costs for ongoing maintenance of its pipeline systems and related facilities, including those incurred for pipeline integrity management activities, equipment overhauls, general upkeep and repairs. these costs are not dependent on the amount of revenues earned from its natural gas transportation services. the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration (phmsa) has developed regulations that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in highly populated areas. these regulations have resulted in an overall increase in ongoing maintenance costs, including maintenance capital and maintenance expense. phmsa has proposed more prescriptive regulations, including expanded integrity management requirements, automatic or remote-controlled valve use, leak detection system installation, pipeline material strength testing and verification of maximum allowable pressures of certain pipelines, which if implemented, could require boardwalk pipeline to incur significant additional costs.
maintenance costs may be capitalized or expensed, depending on the nature of the activities. for any given reporting period, the mix of projects that boardwalk pipeline undertakes will affect the amounts it records as property, plant and equipment on its balance sheet or recognize as expenses, which impacts boardwalk pipelines earnings. in 2017, boardwalk pipeline expects to spend approximately $340 million to maintain its pipeline systems, of which approximately $140 million is expected to be maintenance capital. in 2016, boardwalk pipeline spent $321 million, of which $121 million was recorded as maintenance capital. the maintenance capital amounts include pipeline integrity upgrades associated with certain segments of boardwalk pipelines natural gas pipelines which are expected to be completed in 2018.
credit risk credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the default by a customer of its contractual obligations or the customer filing bankruptcy. boardwalk pipeline actively monitors its customer credit profiles, as well as the portion of its revenues generated from investment-grade and non-investment-grade customers. a majority of boardwalk pipelines customers are rated investment-grade by at least one of the major credit rating agencies, however, the ratings of several of its producer customers, including some of those supporting its growth projects, have been downgraded in the past year. the downgrades may restrict liquidity for those customers and indicate a greater likelihood of nonperformance of their contractual obligations, including failure to make future payments or, for customers supporting its growth projects, failure to post required letters of credit or other collateral as construction progresses.
gulf south rate case boardwalk pipelines gulf south subsidiary filed a rate case with the federal energy regulatory commission (ferc) in 2014 and reached an uncontested settlement with its customers in 2015, which was subsequently approved by the ferc and became effective on march 1, 2016. the rate case settlement provided for, among other things, a system-wide rate design across the majority of the pipeline system, which resulted in a general overall increase in rates and implementation of a fuel tracker for determining future fuel rates on april 1, 2016. as of december 31, 2015, boardwalk pipeline had a $16 million rate refund liability recorded, which was settled in april of 2016 through a combination of cash payments and invoice credits. had the fuel tracker been implemented april 1, 2015, revenues would have been lower by $18 million and operating expense would have been lower by $13 million for the year ended december 31, 2015.

2016 compared with 2015
total revenues increased $62 million in 2016 as compared with 2015. excluding the net effect of $13 million of proceeds received from the settlement of a legal matter in 2016, $9 million of proceeds received from a business interruption claim in 2015 and items offset in fuel and transportation expense, primarily retained fuel, operating revenues increased $83 million. the increase was driven by an increase in transportation revenues of $71 million, which resulted primarily from growth projects recently placed into service, incremental revenues from the gulf south rate case of $18 million and a full year of revenues from the evangeline pipeline. storage and pal revenues were higher by $17 million primarily from the effects of favorable market conditions on time period price spreads.
operating expenses decreased $16 million in 2016 as compared with 2015. excluding receipt of a franchise tax refund of $10 million in 2015 and items offset in operating revenues, operating costs and expenses increased $5 million primarily due to higher employee related costs, partially offset by decreases in maintenance activities and depreciation expense. interest expense increased $7 million primarily due to higher average interest rates compared to 2015.
net income increased $15 million in 2016 as compared with 2015, primarily reflecting higher revenues and lower operating expenses, partially offset by higher interest expense as discussed above.
2015 compared with 2014
total revenues increased $18 million in 2015 as compared with 2014. excluding the business interruption claim proceeds of $8 million and items offset in fuel and transportation expense, primarily retained fuel, operating revenues increased $33 million. this increase is primarily due to higher transportation revenues of $39 million from growth projects recently placed into service, including the evangeline pipeline which was acquired in october of 2014 and $20 million of additional revenues resulting from the gulf south rate case, partially offset by the effects of comparably warm weather experienced in the early part of the 2015 period in boardwalk pipelines market areas and unfavorable market conditions. storage and pal revenues decreased $20 million primarily as a result of the effects of unfavorable market conditions on time period price spreads.
operating expenses decreased $80 million in 2015 as compared with 2014. this decrease is primarily due to a $94 million prior year charge to write off all capitalized costs associated with the terminated bluegrass project, a $10 million franchise tax refund related to settlement of prior tax periods and a decrease in fuel and transportation expense due to lower natural gas prices. these decreases were partially offset by higher depreciation expense of $35
63
million from an increase in the asset base, including the evangeline pipeline acquisition and a change in the estimated lives of certain older, low-pressure assets. maintenance expense increased by $15 million primarily due to pipeline system maintenance activities and the evangeline pipeline acquisition. interest expense increased $11 million primarily due to higher average debt balances as compared with 2014, lower capitalized interest related to capital projects and the expensing of previously deferred costs related to the refinancing of boardwalk pipelines revolving credit facility.
net income increased $56 million in 2015 as compared with 2014, primarily reflecting the prior year bluegrass charge of $55 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) and higher revenues partially offset by higher depreciation and interest expense as discussed above.

2016 compared with 2015
operating revenues increased $30 million in 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to the acquisition of one hotel during 2016 and the acquisition of two hotels during 2015, partially offset by a decrease in revenue at the loews miami beach hotel due to renovations during 2016.
operating and depreciation expenses increased $22 million and $9 million in 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to the acquisition of one hotel during 2016 and the acquisition of two hotels during 2015.
equity income from joint ventures in 2016 was impacted by costs associated with opening one new hotel during 2016 and the $13 million impairment of an equity interest in a joint venture hotel property.
interest expense increased $3 million in 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to new property-level debt incurred to fund acquisitions.
net income was consistent in 2016 as compared with 2015 due to the increases in revenues and expenses discussed above.
loews hotels expects to sell its equity interest in and conclude its management contract for the loews don cesar hotel, a joint venture hotel property, in the first quarter of 2017 and record a gain on the sale.

2015 compared with 2014
operating revenues increased $129 million in 2015 as compared with 2014 primarily due to the acquisition of two hotels during 2015 and three hotels during 2014.
operating and depreciation expenses increased $116 million and $17 million in 2015 as compared with 2014 primarily due to the acquisition of two hotels during 2015 and three hotels during 2014.
equity income increased $18 million in 2015 as compared with 2014 primarily due to improved performance of the universal orlando joint ventures, partially offset by a $5 million impairment of a joint venture equity interest in a hotel property.
interest expense increased $7 million in 2015 as compared with 2014 primarily due to higher debt levels, including refinancings and new property-level debt incurred to fund acquisitions.
net income increased slightly as compared to the prior year as higher income from universal orlando joint venture properties was partially offset by the negative impact of transaction and transition costs for hotels acquired during the year and higher interest expense. in addition, the effective tax rate increased due to an adjustment for prior years estimate and a higher state tax accrual for an increase in the ratio of florida based income.
corporate corporate operations consist primarily of investment income at the parent company, corporate interest expenses and other corporate administrative costs. investment income includes earnings on cash and short term investments held at the parent company level to meet current and future liquidity needs, as well as results of limited partnership investments and the trading portfolio.

2016 compared with 2015
net investment income increased by $124 million in 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to improved performance of equity based investments and fixed income investments in the trading portfolio and improved results from limited partnership investments.
operating expenses increased $15 million in 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to expenses related to the 2016 incentive compensation plan, which was approved by shareholders on may 10, 2016.
net results improved by $68 million in 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to the changes discussed above.
65
2015 compared with 2014
net investment income decreased by $72 million in 2015 as compared with 2014 primarily due to lower performance of equities and derivative related securities in the trading portfolio and lower results from limited partnership investments.
net results decreased by $51 million in 2015 as compared with 2014 primarily due to the change in revenues discussed above and increased corporate overhead expenses.
liquidity and capital resources parent company parent company cash and investments, net of receivables and payables, at december 31, 2016 totaled $5.0 billion, as compared to $4.3 billion at december 31, 2015. in 2016, we received $780 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, including a special dividend from cna of $485 million. cash outflows included the payment of $134 million to fund treasury stock purchases, $8 million to purchase shares of cna, $84 million of cash dividends to our shareholders and net cash contributions of approximately $20 million to loews hotels. as a holding company we depend on dividends from our subsidiaries and returns on our investment portfolio to fund our obligations. we are not responsible for the liabilities and obligations of our subsidiaries and there are no parent company guarantees.
as of december 31, 2016, there were 336,621,358 shares of loews common stock outstanding. depending on market and other conditions, we may purchase our shares and shares of our subsidiaries outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise. in 2016, we purchased 3.4 million shares of loews common stock and 0.3 million shares of cna common stock. we have an effective registration statement on form s-3 on file with the securities and exchange commission (sec) registering the future sale of an unlimited amount of our debt and equity securities.
in march of 2016, moodys investors service, inc. (moodys) downgraded our unsecured debt rating from a2 to a3, and the outlook remains stable. our current unsecured debt ratings are a+ for s&p global ratings (s&p) and a for fitch ratings, inc., with a stable outlook for both. should one or more rating agencies downgrade our credit ratings from current levels, or announce that they have placed us under review for a potential downgrade, our cost of capital could increase and our ability to raise new capital could be adversely affected.
we continue to pursue conservative financial strategies while seeking opportunities for responsible growth. future uses of our cash may include investing in our subsidiaries, new acquisitions and/or repurchases of our and our subsidiaries outstanding common stock.
subsidiaries cnas cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion in 2016 and 2015. cash provided by operating activities in 2016 reflected increased receipts relating to the returns on invested capital for limited partnerships, lower income taxes paid, and offset by higher net claim and expense payments. in 2015, cash provided by operating activities reflected lower premiums collected and decreased receipts relating to returns on limited partnerships, offset by lower net claim payments.
cna declared and paid dividends of $3.00 per share on its common stock, including a special dividend of $2.00 per share in 2016. on february 3, 2017, cnas board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, and a special dividend of $2.00 per share payable march 8, 2017 to shareholders of record on february 20, 2017. cnas declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of its board of directors and will depend on many factors, including cnas earnings, financial condition, business needs and regulatory constraints. the payment of dividends by cnas insurance subsidiaries without prior approval of the insurance department of each subsidiarys domiciliary jurisdiction is limited by formula. dividends in excess of these amounts are subject to prior approval by the respective state insurance departments.
66
dividends from the continental casualty company (ccc), a subsidiary of cna, are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the state of illinois, the domiciliary state of ccc. under these laws, ordinary dividends, or dividends that do not require prior approval by the illinois department of insurance (the department), are determined based on the greater of the prior years statutory net income or 10% of statutory surplus as of the end of the prior year, as well as timing and amount of dividends paid in the preceding 12 months. additionally, ordinary dividends may only be paid from earned surplus, which is calculated by removing unrealized gains from unassigned surplus. as of december 31, 2016, ccc is in a positive earned surplus position. the maximum allowable dividend ccc could pay during 2017 that would not be subject to the departments prior approval is $1.1 billion, less dividends paid during the preceding 12 months measured at that point in time. ccc paid dividends of $765 million in 2016. the actual level of dividends paid in any year is determined after an assessment of available dividend capacity, holding company liquidity and cash needs as well as the impact the dividends will have on the statutory surplus of the applicable insurance company.
diamond offshores cash provided by operating activities decreased approximately $90 million in 2016 as compared with 2015, primarily due to lower cash receipts from contract drilling services of $705 million, partially offset by a $585 million net decrease in cash payments for contract drilling and general and administrative expenses, including personnel-related, maintenance and other rig operating costs and lower income taxes paid, net of refunds of $30 million. the decline in cash receipts and cash payments related to contract drilling services both reflect an aggregate decline in contract drilling operations, as well as a lower cost structure and the favorable impact of cost control initiatives.
for 2017, diamond offshore has budgeted approximately $135 million for capital expenditures.
in 2016, diamond offshore completed four sale and leaseback transactions and received $210 million in proceeds, which was less than the carrying value of the equipment. the resulting difference was recorded as prepaid rent with no gain or loss recognized on the transactions. for further information about these transactions, see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
as of december 31, 2016, diamond offshore had $104 million in borrowings outstanding under its credit agreement and was in compliance with all covenant requirements thereunder. as of february 10, 2017, diamond offshore had no outstanding borrowings and $1.5 billion available under its credit agreement to provide short term liquidity for payment obligations.
in november of 2016, s&p downgraded diamond offshores corporate credit rating to bb+ from bbb, and, in january of 2017, further downgraded its corporate credit rating to bb-, with a negative outlook. diamond offshores current corporate credit rating by moodys is ba2 with a stable outlook. market conditions and other factors, many of which are outside of diamond offshores control, could cause its credit ratings to be lowered further. a downgrade in diamond offshores credit ratings could adversely impact its cost of issuing additional debt and the amount of additional debt that it could issue, and could further restrict its access to capital markets and its ability to raise additional debt. as a consequence, diamond offshore may not be able to issue additional debt in amounts and/or with terms that it considers to be reasonable. one or more of these occurrences could limit diamond offshores ability to pursue other business opportunities.
diamond offshore will make periodic assessments of its capital spending programs based on industry conditions and will make adjustments if it determines they are required. diamond offshore, may, from time to time, issue debt or equity securities, or a combination thereof, to finance capital expenditures, the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes. diamond offshores ability to access the capital markets by issuing debt or equity securities will be dependent on its results of operations, current financial condition, current credit ratings, current market conditions and other factors beyond its control.
boardwalk pipelines cash provided by operating activities increased $24 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to increased net income, excluding the effects of non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, partially offset by timing of accruals and the gulf south rate refund.
67
in 2016 and 2015, boardwalk pipeline declared and paid distributions to its common unitholders of record of $0.40 per common unit and an amount to the general partner on behalf of its 2% general partner interest. in february of 2017, the partnership declared a quarterly cash distribution to unitholders of record of $0.10 per common unit.
in january of 2017, boardwalk pipeline completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.5% senior notes due july 15, 2027 and plans to use the proceeds to refinance future maturities of debt and to fund growth capital expenditures. initially, the proceeds were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility. as of february 13, 2017, boardwalk pipeline had $65 million of outstanding borrowings and $1.4 billion of available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility. during 2016, boardwalk pipeline extended the maturity date of the revolving credit facility by one year to may 26, 2021. boardwalk pipeline has in place a subordinated loan agreement with a subsidiary of the company under which it could borrow up to $300 million until december 31, 2018. boardwalk pipeline had no outstanding borrowings under the subordinated loan agreement.
for 2016 and 2015, boardwalk pipelines capital expenditures were $590 million and $375 million, consisting of a combination of growth and maintenance capital. boardwalk pipeline expects total capital expenditures to be approximately $850 million in 2017, primarily related to growth projects and pipeline system maintenance expenditures.
boardwalk pipeline anticipates that for 2017 its existing capital resources, including its revolving credit facility, subordinated loan and cash flows from operating activities, will be adequate to fund its operations. boardwalk pipeline may seek to access the capital markets to fund some or all capital expenditures for growth projects, acquisitions or for general business purposes. boardwalk pipelines ability to access the capital markets for equity and debt financing under reasonable terms depends on its financial condition, credit ratings and market conditions.

investments investment activities of non-insurance subsidiaries primarily include investments in fixed income securities, including short term investments. the parent company portfolio also includes equity securities, including short sales and derivative instruments, and investments in limited partnerships. these types of investments generally present greater volatility, less liquidity and greater risk than fixed income investments and are included within results of operations  corporate.
we enter into short sales and invest in certain derivative instruments that are used for asset and liability management activities, income enhancements to our portfolio management strategy and to benefit from anticipated future movements in the underlying markets. if such movements do not occur as anticipated, then significant losses may occur. monitoring procedures include senior management review of daily reports of existing positions and valuation fluctuations to seek to ensure that open positions are consistent with our portfolio strategy.
credit exposure associated with non-performance by counterparties to our derivative instruments is generally limited to the uncollateralized change in fair value of the derivative instruments recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. we mitigate the risk of non-performance by monitoring the creditworthiness of counterparties and diversifying derivatives by using multiple counterparties. we occasionally require collateral from our derivative investment counterparties depending on the amount of the exposure and the credit rating of the counterparty.

duration a primary objective in the management of cnas investment portfolio is to optimize return relative to corresponding liabilities and respective liquidity needs. cnas views on the current interest rate environment, tax regulations, asset class valuations, specific security issuer and broader industry segment conditions and domestic and global economic conditions, are some of the factors that enter into an investment decision. cna also continually monitors exposure to issuers of securities held and broader industry sector exposures and may from time to time adjust such exposures based on its views of a specific issuer or industry sector.
a further consideration in the management of cnas investment portfolio is the characteristics of the corresponding liabilities and the ability to align the duration of the portfolio to those liabilities and to meet future liquidity needs, minimize interest rate risk and maintain a level of income sufficient to support the underlying insurance liabilities. for portfolios where future liability cash flows are determinable and typically long term in nature, cna segregates investments for asset/liability management purposes. the segregated investments support the long term care and structured settlement liabilities in non-core operations.
the effective durations of cnas fixed maturity securities and short term investments are presented in the following table. amounts presented are net of payable and receivable amounts for securities purchased and sold, but not yet settled.

the duration of the total fixed income portfolio is in line with portfolio targets. the duration of the assets supporting the non-core operations has declined, reflective of increases in expected bond call activity in cnas municipal bond portfolio and the low interest rate environment.
the investment portfolio is periodically analyzed for changes in duration and related price risk. additionally, cna periodically reviews the sensitivity of the portfolio to the level of foreign exchange rates and other factors that contribute to market price changes. a summary of these risks and specific analysis on changes is in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk included under item 7a.

insurance reserves the level of reserves cna maintains represents its best estimate, as of a particular point in time, of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on cnas assessment of facts and circumstances known at that time. reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates that cna derives, generally utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation techniques, from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, both internal and external, many of which are highly uncertain. as noted below, cna reviews its reserves for each segment of its business periodically, and any such review could result in the need to increase reserves in amounts which could be material and could adversely affect our results of operations and equity and cnas business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings. further information on reserves is provided in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
property and casualty claim and claim adjustment expense reserves cna maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for claims that have been reported but not yet settled (case reserves) and claims that have been incurred but not reported (ibnr). ibnr includes a provision for development on known cases as well as a provision for late reported incurred claims. claim and claim adjustment expense reserves are reflected as liabilities and are included on the consolidated balance sheets under the heading insurance reserves. adjustments to prior year reserve estimates, if necessary, are reflected in results of operations in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. the carried case and ibnr reserves as of each balance sheet date are provided in the discussion that follows and in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
there is a risk that cnas recorded reserves are insufficient to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses. unforeseen emerging or potential claims and coverage issues are difficult to predict and could materially adversely affect the adequacy of cnas claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and could lead to future reserve additions.
in addition, cnas property and casualty insurance subsidiaries also have actual and potential exposures related to a&ep claims, which could result in material losses. to mitigate the risks posed by cnas exposure to a&ep claims and claim adjustment expenses, cna completed a transaction with national indemnity company (nico), under which substantially all of cnas legacy a&ep liabilities were ceded to nico effective january 1, 2010. see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 for further discussion about the transaction with nico, its impact on cnas results of operations and the deferred retroactive reinsurance gain.
establishing property & casualty reserve estimates in developing claim and claim adjustment expense (loss or losses) reserve estimates, cnas actuaries perform detailed reserve analyses that are staggered throughout the year. the data is organized at a reserve group level. a reserve group can be a line of business covering a subset of insureds such as commercial automobile liability for small or middle market customers, it can encompass several lines of business provided to a specific set of customers such as dentists, or it can be a particular type of claim such as construction defect. every reserve group is reviewed at least once during the year. the analyses generally review losses gross of ceded reinsurance and apply the ceded reinsurance terms to the gross estimates to establish estimates net of reinsurance. in addition to the detailed analyses, cna reviews actual loss emergence for all products each quarter.
most of cnas business can be characterized as long-tail. for long-tail business, it will generally be several years between the time the business is written and the time when all claims are settled. cnas long-tail exposures include commercial automobile liability, workers compensation, general liability, medical professional liability, other professional liability and management liability coverages, assumed reinsurance run-off and products liability. short-tail exposures include property, commercial automobile physical damage, marine, surety and warranty. property and casualty operations contain both long-tail and short-tail exposures. non-core operations contain long-tail exposures.
various methods are used to project ultimate losses for both long-tail and short-tail exposures.
73
the paid development method estimates ultimate losses by reviewing paid loss patterns and applying them to accident or policy years with further expected changes in paid losses. selection of the paid loss pattern may require consideration of several factors including the impact of inflation on claims costs, the rate at which claims professionals make claim payments and close claims, the impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting changes, the impact of large claim payments and other factors. claim cost inflation itself may require evaluation of changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, changes in the cost of medical care, changes in the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. because this method assumes that losses are paid at a consistent rate, changes in any of these factors can impact the results. since the method does not rely on case reserves, it is not directly influenced by changes in their adequacy.
for many reserve groups, paid loss data for recent periods may be too immature or erratic for accurate predictions. this situation often exists for long-tail exposures. in addition, changes in the factors described above may result in inconsistent payment patterns. finally, estimating the paid loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available in the data analyzed often involves considerable uncertainty for long-tail products such as workers compensation.
the incurred development method is similar to the paid development method, but it uses case incurred losses instead of paid losses. since the method uses more data (case reserves in addition to paid losses) than the paid development method, the incurred development patterns may be less variable than paid patterns. however, selection of the incurred loss pattern typically requires analysis of all of the same factors described above. in addition, the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving practices have taken place, and the use of case incurred losses may not eliminate the issues associated with estimating the incurred loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available.
the loss ratio method multiplies earned premiums by an expected loss ratio to produce ultimate loss estimates for each accident or policy year. this method may be useful for immature accident or policy periods or if loss development patterns are inconsistent, losses emerge very slowly, or there is relatively little loss history from which to estimate future losses. the selection of the expected loss ratio typically requires analysis of loss ratios from earlier accident or policy years or pricing studies and analysis of inflationary trends, frequency trends, rate changes, underwriting changes and other applicable factors.
the bornhuetter-ferguson method using paid loss is a combination of the paid development method and the loss ratio method. this method normally determines expected loss ratios similar to the approach used to estimate the expected loss ratio for the loss ratio method and typically requires analysis of the same factors described above. this method assumes that future losses will develop at the expected loss ratio level. the percent of paid loss to ultimate loss implied from the paid development method is used to determine what percentage of ultimate loss is yet to be paid. the use of the pattern from the paid development method typically requires consideration of the same factors listed in the description of the paid development method. the estimate of losses yet to be paid is added to current paid losses to estimate the ultimate loss for each year. for long-tail lines, this method will react very slowly if actual ultimate loss ratios are different from expectations due to changes not accounted for by the expected loss ratio calculation.
the bornhuetter-ferguson method using incurred loss is similar to the bornhuetter-ferguson method using paid loss except that it uses case incurred losses. the use of case incurred losses instead of paid losses can result in development patterns that are less variable than paid patterns. however, the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving have taken place, and the method typically requires analysis of the same factors that need to be reviewed for the loss ratio and incurred development methods.
the frequency times severity method multiplies a projected number of ultimate claims by an estimated ultimate average loss for each accident or policy year to produce ultimate loss estimates. since projections of the ultimate number of claims are often less variable than projections of ultimate loss, this method can provide more reliable results for reserve groups where loss development patterns are inconsistent or too variable to be relied on exclusively. in addition, this method can more directly account for changes in coverage that impact the number and size of claims. however, this method can be difficult to apply to situations where very large claims or a substantial number of unusual claims result in volatile average claim sizes. projecting the ultimate number of claims may require analysis of several factors, including the rate at which policyholders report claims to cna, the impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting changes and other factors. estimating the ultimate average loss may
74
require analysis of the impact of large losses and claim cost trends based on changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, changes in the cost of medical care, changes in the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors.
stochastic modeling produces a range of possible outcomes based on varying assumptions related to the particular reserve group being modeled. for some reserve groups, cna uses models which rely on historical development patterns at an aggregate level, while other reserve groups are modeled using individual claim variability assumptions supplied by the claims department. in either case, multiple simulations using varying assumptions are run and the results are analyzed to produce a range of potential outcomes. the results will typically include a mean and percentiles of the possible reserve distribution which aid in the selection of a point estimate.
for many exposures, especially those that can be considered long-tail, a particular accident or policy year may not have a sufficient volume of paid losses to produce a statistically reliable estimate of ultimate losses. in such a case, cnas actuaries typically assign more weight to the incurred development method than to the paid development method. as claims continue to settle and the volume of paid loss increases, the actuaries may assign additional weight to the paid development method. for most of cnas products, even the incurred losses for accident or policy years that are early in the claim settlement process will not be of sufficient volume to produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses. in these cases, cna may not assign any weight to the paid and incurred development methods. cna will use the loss ratio, bornhuetter-ferguson and frequency times severity methods. for short-tail exposures, the paid and incurred development methods can often be relied on sooner primarily because cnas history includes a sufficient number of years to cover the entire period over which paid and incurred losses are expected to change. however, cna may also use the loss ratio, bornhuetter-ferguson and frequency times severity methods for short-tail exposures.
for other more complex reserve groups where the above methods may not produce reliable indications, cna uses additional methods tailored to the characteristics of the specific situation.
periodic reserve reviews the reserve analyses performed by cnas actuaries result in point estimates. each quarter, the results of the detailed reserve reviews are summarized and discussed with cnas senior management to determine the best estimate of reserves. cnas senior management considers many factors in making this decision. cnas recorded reserves reflect its best estimate as of a particular point in time based upon known facts and circumstances, consideration of the factors cited above and its judgment. the carried reserve may differ from the actuarial point estimate. see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 for further discussion of the factors considered in determining managements best estimate.
currently, cnas recorded reserves are modestly higher than the actuarial point estimate. for the property and casualty operations, the difference between cnas reserves and the actuarial point estimate is primarily driven by uncertainty with respect to immature accident years, claim cost inflation, changes in claims handling, changes to the tort environment which may adversely impact claim costs and the effects from the economy. for cnas legacy a&ep liabilities, the difference between cnas reserves and the actuarial point estimate is primarily driven by the potential tail volatility of run-off exposures.
the key assumptions fundamental to the reserving process are often different for various reserve groups and accident or policy years. some of these assumptions are explicit assumptions that are required of a particular method, but most of the assumptions are implicit and cannot be precisely quantified. an example of an explicit assumption is the pattern employed in the paid development method. however, the assumed pattern is itself based on several implicit assumptions such as the impact of inflation on medical costs and the rate at which claim professionals close claims. as a result, the effect on reserve estimates of a particular change in assumptions typically cannot be specifically quantified, and changes in these assumptions cannot be tracked over time.
cnas recorded reserves are managements best estimate. in order to provide an indication of the variability associated with cnas net reserves, the following discussion provides a sensitivity analysis that shows the approximate estimated impact of variations in significant factors affecting cnas reserve estimates for particular types of business. these significant factors are the ones that cna believes could most likely materially affect the
75
reserves. this discussion covers the major types of business for which cna believes a material deviation to its reserves is reasonably possible. there can be no assurance that actual experience will be consistent with the current assumptions or with the variation indicated by the discussion. in addition, there can be no assurance that other factors and assumptions will not have a material impact on cnas reserves.
the three areas for which cna believes a significant deviation to its net reserves is reasonably possible are (i) professional liability, management liability and surety products; (ii) workers compensation and (iii) general liability.
professional liability, management liability and surety products include professional liability coverages provided to various professional firms, including architects, real estate agents, small and mid-sized accounting firms, law firms and other professional firms. they also include d&o, employment practices, fiduciary, fidelity and surety coverages, as well as insurance products serving the health care delivery system. the most significant factor affecting reserve estimates for these liability coverages is claim severity. claim severity is driven by the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, legal fees, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. underwriting and claim handling decisions such as the classes of business written and individual claim settlement decisions can also impact claim severity. if the estimated claim severity increases by 9%, cna estimates that net reserves would increase by approximately $450 million. if the estimated claim severity decreases by 3%, cna estimates that net reserves would decrease by approximately $150 million. cnas net reserves for these products were approximately $5.2 billion as of december 31, 2016.
for workers compensation, since many years will pass from the time the business is written until all claim payments have been made, the most significant factor affecting workers compensation reserve estimate is claim cost inflation on claim payments. workers compensation claim cost inflation is driven by the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, expected claimant lifetimes, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. if estimated workers compensation claim cost inflation increases by 100 basis points for the entire period over which claim payments will be made, cna estimates that its net reserves would increase by approximately $400 million. if estimated workers compensation claim cost inflation decreases by 100 basis points for the entire period over which claim payments will be made, cna estimates that its net reserves would decrease by approximately $350 million. net reserves for workers compensation were approximately $4.3 billion as of december 31, 2016.
for general liability, the most significant factor affecting reserve estimates is claim severity. claim severity is driven by changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislation and other factors. if the estimated claim severity for general liability increases by 6%, cna estimates that its net reserves would increase by approximately $200 million. if the estimated claim severity for general liability decreases by 3%, cna estimates that its net reserves would decrease by approximately $100 million. net reserves for general liability were approximately $3.4 billion as of december 31, 2016.
given the factors described above, it is not possible to quantify precisely the ultimate exposure represented by claims and related litigation. as a result, cna regularly reviews the adequacy of its reserves and reassesses its reserve estimates as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported and settled and additional information becomes available in subsequent periods. in reviewing cnas reserve estimates, cna makes adjustments in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. these reviews have resulted in cnas identification of information and trends that have caused cna to change its reserves in prior periods and could lead to cnas identification of a need for additional material increases or decreases in claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, which could materially affect our results of operations and equity and cnas business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings positively or negatively. see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 for additional information about reserve development.

non-core long term care policyholder reserves cnas non-core operations includes its run-off long term care business as well as structured settlement obligations related to certain property and casualty claimants not funded by annuities. long term care policies provide benefits for nursing homes, assisted living and home health care subject to various daily and lifetime caps. policyholders must continue to make periodic premium payments to keep the policy in force. generally, cna has the ability to increase policy premiums, subject to state regulatory approval.
cna maintains both claim and claim adjustment expense reserves as well as future policy benefits reserves for policyholder benefits for its long term care business. claim and claim adjustment expense reserves consist of estimated reserves for long term care policyholders that are currently receiving benefits, including claims that have been incurred but are not yet reported. in developing the claim and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates for cnas long term care policies, its actuaries perform a detailed claim experience study on an annual basis. the study reviews the sufficiency of existing reserves for policyholders currently on claim and includes an evaluation of expected benefit utilization and claim duration. cnas recorded claim and claim adjustment expense reserves reflect cna managements best estimate after incorporating the results of the most recent study. in addition, claim and claim adjustment expense reserves are also maintained for the structured settlement obligations. future policy benefits reserves represent the active life reserves related to cnas long term care policies and are the present value of expected future benefit payments and expenses less expected future premium. the determination of these reserves is fundamental to cnas financial results and requires management to make estimates and assumptions about expected investment and policyholder experience over the life of the contract. since many of these contracts may be in force for several decades, these assumptions are subject to significant estimation risk.
the actuarial assumptions that management believes are subject to the most variability are morbidity, persistency, discount rate and anticipated future premium rate increases. persistency can be affected by policy lapses and death. discount rate is influenced by the investment yield on assets supporting long term care reserves which is subject to interest rate and market volatility and may also be impacted by changes to the corporate tax code. there is limited historical company and industry data available to cna for long term care morbidity and mortality, as only a portion
77
of the policies written to date are in claims paying status. as a result of this variability, cnas long term care reserves may be subject to material increases if actual experience develops adversely to its expectations.
annually, management assesses the adequacy of its gaap long term care future policy benefits reserves as well as the claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for structured settlement obligations by performing a gross premium valuation (gpv) to determine if there is a premium deficiency. under the gpv, management estimates required reserves using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the assessment without provisions for adverse deviation. the gpv reserves are then compared to the recorded reserves. if the gpv reserves are greater than the existing net gaap reserves (i.e. reserves net of any deferred acquisition costs asset), the existing net gaap reserves are unlocked and are increased to the greater amount. any such increase is reflected in cnas results of operations in the period in which the need for such adjustment is determined, and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and equity and cnas business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings.
the december 31, 2016 gpv indicated carried reserves included a margin of approximately $255 million. a summary of the changes in the gpv results is presented in the table below:

december 31, 2016 margin                                      $255
the increase in the margin in 2016 was driven by expected rate increases from near-term future rate filings on segments of cnas individual long term care block of business as well as higher than expected premium rate increase achievement on rate filings related to cnas group long term care block. this improvement from rate actions was partially offset by minor changes in morbidity assumptions. the effects of persistency and discount rates were relatively small and largely offset one another. additionally, in 2016, cnas annual experience study of long term care claim reserves resulted in a release of $30 million due to favorable severity relative to expectations.
the december 31, 2015 gpv indicated a premium deficiency of $296 million resulting in the unlocking of reserves and the resetting of actuarial assumptions to best estimate assumptions at that date. the indicated premium deficiency necessitated a charge to income of $296 million. in addition to the premium deficiency, cnas annual experience study of claim reserves resulted in reserve strengthening of $9 million. the total impact of the premium deficiency and claim reserve strengthening was $177 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests).

the table below summarizes the estimated pretax impact on cnas results of operations from various hypothetical revisions to cnas active life reserve assumptions. cna has assumed that revisions to such assumptions would occur in each policy type, age and duration within each policy group and would occur absent any changes, mitigating or otherwise, in the other assumptions. although such hypothetical revisions are not currently required or anticipated, cna believes they could occur based on past variances in experience and its expectations of the ranges of future experience that could reasonably occur. any required increase in the net gaap reserves resulting from the hypothetical revision in the table below would first reduce the margin in cnas carried reserves before it would affect results of operations. the estimated impacts to results of operations in the table below are after consideration of the existing margin.

modification of the corporate tax rate could adversely affect the value of the tax benefit received on tax exempt municipal investments and thus the rate at which cna discounts its long term care active life reserves. for illustrative reference, absent a change in investment strategy, a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 20% would require an increase to cnas existing net gaap reserves for the long term care business and an estimated reduction to pretax income of approximately $700 million.
any actual adjustment would be dependent on the specific policies affected and, therefore, may differ from the estimates summarized above.

critical accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (gaap) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. actual results could differ from those estimates.
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with gaap, applied on a consistent basis. we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. in general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the known facts and circumstances.
we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application places the most significant demands on our judgment. due to the inherent uncertainties involved with these types of judgments, actual results could differ significantly from estimates, which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and/or equity and cnas insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings.
insurance reserves insurance reserves are established for both short and long-duration insurance contracts. short-duration contracts are primarily related to property and casualty insurance policies where the reserving process is based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss, including amounts for known and unknown claims. long-duration contracts are primarily related to long term care policies and are estimated using actuarial estimates about morbidity and persistency as well as assumptions about expected investment returns and future premium rate increases. the reserve for unearned premiums on property and casualty contracts represents the portion of premiums written related
80
to the unexpired terms of coverage. the reserving process is discussed in further detail in the insurance reserves section of this md&a.
reinsurance and other receivables exposure exists with respect to the collectibility of ceded property and casualty and life reinsurance to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations or disputes the liabilities cna has ceded under reinsurance agreements. an allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer solvency, cnas past experience and current economic conditions. further information on cnas reinsurance receivables is included in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
additionally, exposure exists with respect to the collectibility of amounts due from customers on other receivables. an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due, currently as well as in the future, managements experience and current economic conditions.
if actual experience differs from the estimates made by management in determining the allowances for doubtful accounts on reinsurance and other receivables, net receivables as reflected on our consolidated balance sheets may not be collected. therefore, our results of operations and/or equity could be materially adversely affected.
valuation of investments and impairment of securities we classify fixed maturity securities and equity securities as either available-for-sale or trading which are both carried at fair value on the balance sheet. fair value represents the price that would be received in a sale of an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date, the determination of which requires us to make a significant number of assumptions and judgments. securities with the greatest level of subjectivity around valuation are those that rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value and that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. these unobservable inputs are based on assumptions consistent with what we believe other market participants would use to price such securities. further information on fair value measurements is included in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
cnas investment portfolio is subject to market declines below amortized cost that may be other-than-temporary and therefore result in the recognition of impairment losses in earnings. factors considered in the determination of whether or not a decline is other-than-temporary include a current intention or need to sell the security or an indication that a credit loss exists. significant judgment exists regarding the evaluation of the financial condition and expected near-term and long term prospects of the issuer, the relevant industry conditions and trends, and whether cna expects to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. further information on cnas process for evaluating impairments is included in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
long term care policies future policy benefits reserves for cnas long term care policies are based on certain assumptions including morbidity, persistency, discount rates and future premium rate increases. the adequacy of the reserves is contingent upon actual experience and cnas future expectations related to these key assumptions. if actual or cnas expected future experience differs from these assumptions, the reserves may not be adequate, requiring cna to add to reserves.
a prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in cnas reserving discount rate assumption could result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting cnas obligations under long term care policies, which may also require an increase to cnas reserves. in addition, cna may not receive regulatory approval for the premium rate increases it requests.
these changes to cnas reserves could materially adversely impact our results of operations and equity. the reserving process is discussed in further detail in the insurance reserves section of this md&a.
81
pension and postretirement benefit obligations we make a significant number of assumptions in order to estimate the liabilities and costs related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations. the assumptions that have the most impact on pension costs are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. these assumptions are based on, among other things, current economic factors such as inflation, interest rates and broader capital market expectations. changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense.
in determining the discount rate assumption, we utilize current market information and liability information, including a discounted cash flow analysis of our pension and postretirement obligations. in particular, the basis for our discount rate selection was the yield on indices of highly rated fixed income debt securities with durations comparable to that of our plan liabilities. the yield curve was applied to expected future retirement plan payments to adjust the discount rate to reflect the cash flow characteristics of the plans. the yield curves and indices evaluated in the selection of the discount rate are comprised of high quality corporate bonds that are rated aa by an accepted rating agency.
in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption, we consider the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio and the expected investment horizon.
further information on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations is in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
impairment of long-lived assets we review our long-lived assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. we use a probability-weighted cash flow analysis to test property and equipment for impairment based on relevant market data. if an asset is determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to the fair value of the asset. managements cash flow assumptions are an inherent part of our asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from the reported amounts.
income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities. any resulting future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not, and a valuation allowance is established for any portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes may not be realized. the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future earnings, reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. if actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions, the recorded deferred tax asset may not be fully realized, resulting in an increase to income tax expense in our results of operations. in addition, the ability to record deferred tax assets in the future could be limited resulting in a higher effective tax rate in that future period.
we have not established deferred tax liabilities for certain of our foreign earnings as we intend to indefinitely reinvest those earnings to finance foreign activities. however, if these earnings become subject to u.s. federal tax, any required provision could have a material impact on our financial results.

overview management of the company focuses on several client activity and financial metrics in evaluating the company's financial position and operating performance. management believes that metrics relating to net new and total client assets, as well as client cash levels and utilization of advisory services, offer perspective on the company's business momentum and client engagement. data on new and total client brokerage accounts provides additional perspective on the company's ability to attract and retain new business. management believes that net revenue growth, pre-tax profit margin, eps, and return on average common stockholders' equity provide broad indicators of the company's overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns. management considers expenses, excluding interest, as a percentage of average client assets to be a measure of operating efficiency. finally, management believes the consolidated tier 1 leverage ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint currently imposed by regulators. results for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 are:

2016 compared to 2015
in 2016, net income available to common stockholders increased $382 million, or 28%, from the prior year, resulting in diluted eps of $1.31 in 2016 compared to $1.03 in 2015. net revenues improved by $1.1 billion, or 17%, while expenses excluding interest increased $384 million, or 9%, compared to 2015.
strong client momentum continued as the company's innovative, full-service model resonated with clients and drove growth during the year. the company added 1.1 million new brokerage accounts to its client base during 2016, which contributed to bringing the total active brokerage accounts to 10.2 million by year-end. core net new assets from new and existing clients totaled $125.5 billion in 2016, which helped grow total client assets to $2.78 trillion as of december 31, 2016. also during 2016, investors increasingly turned to the company's advice offerings resulting in a 12% increase in client assets enrolled in one of the company's retail advisory solutions and those guided by independent advisors, to $1.40 trillion at the end of the year.
the company expanded client assets by 11% during an environment that had periods of marked volatility, but ultimately included improving economic conditions. the standard & poor's 500 index ended 2016 10% higher than the prior year end. after years of ultra-low interest rates, the federal reserve's move to increase the overnight federal funds target rate by 25 basis points in december 2015 helped throughout 2016; the federal reserve's subsequent additional 25 basis point increase in december 2016 had little time to impact 2016 results. other short-term rates also rose in 2016. the one-month london interbank offered rate (libor) improved 34 basis points to .77% at december 31, 2016 compared to december 31, 2015.
these external drivers and the solid client growth helped produce strong net revenue growth. the company's 17% net revenue growth was led by increased net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees, which more than offset lower revenue from trading and other revenue. net interest revenue improved $797 million, or 32%, in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a 21% increase in average interest earning assets and a 13 basis point improvement in the average net interest margin from year to year, to 1.73%. the lift in interest-earning assets was due to a combination of the company's ongoing asset gathering efforts, additional bulk transfers of client cash sweep balances from money market funds to schwab bank, and the designation of schwab bank as the default sweep option for virtually all new brokerage accounts as of june 2016. asset management and administration fees improved $405 million, or 15%, primarily due to higher short-term interest rates affecting the yield on money market funds.
strong net revenue growth provided room for increased investment in people and technology, resulting in a 9% expense growth for 2016. this increase allowed for a 780 basis point gap between net revenue and expense growth and a pre-tax profit margin of 40.0% in 2016, compared to 35.7% in 2015.
2015 compared to 2014
in 2015, the company's net revenue and net income grew despite an environment that included significant equity market volatility and continued low interest rates. the standard & poor's 500 index declined as much as 9% during the year and ultimately ended the year down 1% when compared to the prior year. the overnight federal funds target rate increased 25 basis points in december 2015; however, the increase had limited effect on 2015 results. the year end 2015 one-month libor yield improved 28 basis points to .43% compared to 2014. long-term interest rates decreased in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. the average 10-year u.s. treasury yield during 2015 was 2.13%, 40 basis points lower than the average yield during 2014.
core net new assets totaled $134.7 billion in 2015 compared to $124.8 billion in 2014. total client assets ended 2015 at $2.51 trillion, up 2% from the year ended 2014, despite the $89.2 billion impact of reduced market valuation on client assets during the year.
the company added 1.1 million new brokerage accounts to its client base during 2015, up 10% compared to 2014. active brokerage accounts ended 2015 at 9.8 million, up 4% on a year-over-year basis. faced with economic uncertainty and the resulting market volatility, investors increasingly turned to advice offerings throughout the year. over 155,000 accounts enrolled in one of the company's retail advisory solutions during 2015, 60% more than the year-earlier period, and total accounts using these solutions reached 560,000, up 14% year-over-year.

the charles schwab corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
(tabular amounts in millions, except ratios, or as noted)
during 2015, the company's net revenues increased 5% compared to 2014 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees, partially offset by a decrease in trading revenue.
growth in expenses excluding interest was limited to a 4% increase in 2015 primarily reflecting business growth related increases in compensation, benefits and other expenses.
the combined effect of market conditions, strong business growth, and the company's overall spending discipline resulted in a pre-tax profit margin of 35.7% in 2015.
subsequent event on january 26, 2017, the company announced that mr. peter crawford, executive vice president - finance, will succeed mr. joseph r. martinetto as the company's chief financial officer, effective may 16, 2017.
mr. martinetto will continue as senior executive vice president at csc, maintaining oversight of several functions including the company's banking, technology and operations units.
current regulatory environment and other developments in september 2016, the occ issued final guidelines for recovery planning by national banks and federal savings banks with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. the guidelines require each bank to develop and maintain a recovery plan that describes how the bank will restore itself to financial health and viability in response to a wide range of external and internal financial and operational stress scenarios. the guidelines went into effect on january 1, 2017, and schwab bank has until the end of 2017 to develop and prepare a recovery plan.
in may 2016, the federal reserve, the occ and the fdic jointly issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would impose a minimum nsfr on certain banking organizations, including csc. the effective date of the rule would be january 1, 2018. the comment period for the proposed rule ended on august 5, 2016 and the impact to the company cannot be assessed until the final rule is released.
in october 2015, the federal reserve issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on total loss-absorbing capacity and long-term debt that, among other things, would have required certain financial institutions that are subject to the federal reserve's capital rules to deduct from their regulatory capital the amount of any investments in or exposure to unsecured debt issued by u.s. bank holding companies identified as global systemically important banking organizations (gsibs). in december 2016, the federal reserve issued a final rule that did not include this regulatory capital deduction proposal. at the same time, the federal reserve did indicate its intent to work with the occ and fdic to develop a proposed interagency approach towards the regulatory capital treatment of gsib unsecured debt. the company will evaluate any such proposal when it is issued.

asset management and administration fees asset management and administration fees include mutual fund and etf service fees and fees for other asset-based financial services provided to individual and institutional clients. the company earns mutual fund and etf service fees for shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds. asset management and administration fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in these funds and do not include securities lending revenues earned by proprietary mutual funds and etfs, as those amounts, net of program fees, are credited to the fund shareholders. the fair values of client assets included in proprietary and third-party mutual funds and etfs are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data.
the company also earns asset management fees for advice solutions, which include managed portfolios, specialized strategies and customized investment advice. other asset management and administration fees include various asset-based fees such as trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, mutual fund clearing fees, collective trust fund fees, and non-balance based service and transaction fees.
asset management and administration fees vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity. for a discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees, see risk management in part ii, item 7.

asset management and administration fees increased by $405 million, or 15%, in 2016 from 2015, and by $117 million, or 5%, in 2015 from 2014. the increases in both years were due to higher net yields on money market fund assets as short-term interest rates rose in 2016 and 2015, and growth in client assets enrolled in advisory offers, partially offset by a reduction in client assets in mutual fund onesource.
the average fee rate on advice solutions decreased in 2016 and 2015 from the prior years primarily due to the growth in intelligent portfolios, which do not charge advisory fees.
net interest revenue the company's primary interest-earning assets include cash and cash equivalents; segregated cash and investments; margin loans, which constitute the majority of receivables from brokerage clients; investment securities; and bank loans. revenue on interest-earning assets is affected by various factors, such as the composition of assets, prevailing interest rates at the time of origination or purchase, changes in interest rates on floating rate securities, and changes in prepayment levels for mortgage-related securities and loans. fees earned on securities borrowing and lending activities, which are conducted by the

company's broker-dealer subsidiaries on assets held in client brokerage accounts, are included in other interest revenue and expense.
the company's interest-bearing liabilities include bank deposits, payables to brokerage clients, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt. the company establishes the rates paid on client-related liabilities, and management expects that it will generally adjust the rates paid on these liabilities at some fraction of any movement in short-term rates. client-related liabilities have historically been very stable and are largely expected to remain so. given the stability and low rate sensitivity of these liabilities, management believes their duration is relatively long, somewhere in excess of three and a half years.
management believes that the extended period of extraordinarily low interest rates running from the financial crisis to the present has likely resulted in certain sweep cash balances retaining some level of latent rate sensitivity. to the extent short-term rates increase, management expects some sweep cash balances to migrate to purchased money market funds or other higher-yielding alternatives. at the same time, the company will retain the opportunity to migrate the remaining non-rate sensitive cash in sweep money market funds to schwab bank.
management has positioned the company to benefit from an increase in interest rates, especially short-term interest rates, by managing the duration of interest-earning assets to be shorter than that of interest-bearing liabilities, so that asset yields will move faster than liability costs.
in order to keep the company's interest-rate sensitivity within established limits, management monitors and responds to changes in the balance sheet. as the company builds its client base, it attracts a significant amount of new client sweep cash, which, along with the bulk transfer of existing sweep cash balances from money market funds, is a primary driver of balance sheet growth. as the proportion of sweep cash balances to total liabilities has grown, the measured duration of liabilities has grown as well. by increasing the duration of interest-earning assets as necessary, management has kept the company positioned to continue to gain from increasing rates while limiting its exposure to falling rates to an acceptable level. management currently manages the balance sheet so that just over half of the company's investment securities and loans re-price or reset based on short-term interest rates such as one-month libor.
non-interest-bearing funding sources include certain cash balances, stockholders' equity and other miscellaneous assets and liabilities.

net interest revenue increased $797 million, or 32%, in 2016 from 2015 due primarily to higher interest-earning assets driven by growth in bank deposits. the company has grown bank deposits through a combination of:
·   gathering additional assets from new and current clients;

·   transferring uninvested cash balances in certain client brokerage accounts to schwab bank; and

·   establishing the schwab bank sweep feature as the default investment option for uninvested cash balances within all new brokerage accounts as of june 2016.

the company has invested the cash from the growth in bank deposits and from recent short-term borrowings in investment securities. these incremental investments, coupled with an increase in short-term interest rates, have resulted in a 13 basis point improvement in the net interest margin to 1.73% in 2016.
net interest revenue increased $253 million, or 11%, in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the effect of lower net interest margins. the growth in the average balances in bank deposits resulted from an increase in the uninvested cash balances in certain client brokerage accounts swept to schwab bank.
trading revenue trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. commission revenue is affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade. principal transaction revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from trading activity in fixed income securities with clients. to accommodate clients' fixed income trading activity, the company maintains positions in fixed income securities, including u.s. state and municipal debt obligations, u.s. government and corporate debt, and other securities. the difference between the price at which the

company buys and sells securities to and from its clients and other broker-dealers is recognized as principal transaction revenue. principal transaction revenue also includes adjustments to the fair value of these securities positions.
the following table presents trading revenue and the related drivers:

trading revenue decreased in both 2016 and 2015 by $41 million primarily due to a decrease in commission revenue as a result of lower commissions per revenue trade.
daily average revenue trades remained relatively flat in 2016 from 2015. daily average revenue trades decreased in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to a lower volume of equity trades. average revenue per revenue trade decreased 5% in 2016 compared to 2015, due to a higher proportion of trades from active traders, who typically pay a lower commission rate, as well as increased client utilization of discounted trade offers. average revenue per revenue trade decreased 2% in 2015 compared to 2014. over time, the percentage of trading revenue has declined from a peak of 50%-60% of total net revenue in the early 1990s to the current low of 11% at december 31, 2016.
other revenue other revenue includes order flow revenue, other service fees, software fees from the company's portfolio management solutions, exchange processing fees, and nonrecurring gains.
other revenue decreased by $57 million, or 17%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to lower litigation proceeds of $16 million in 2016 compared to $75 million in 2015 related to the company's non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (rmbs) portfolio. order flow revenue was $103 million during both 2016 and 2015.
other revenue decreased by $15 million, or 4%, in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower order flow revenue. order flow revenue was $103 million during 2015 compared to $114 million during 2014. the decrease was primarily due to changes in the composition and volume of different types of orders and the fees and rebates for such orders. other revenue in 2015 also includes net litigation proceeds of $75 million related to the company's non-agency rmbs portfolio. other revenue in 2014 includes a net insurance settlement of $45 million and net litigation proceeds of $28 million related to the company's non-agency rmbs portfolio.

salaries and wages increased in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to higher employee headcount to support the growth in the business and annual salary increases. incentive compensation increased in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to higher discretionary bonus expenses, long-term incentive plan costs, and field incentive plan costs relating to increased net client asset flows. employee benefits and other expense increased in 2016 from 2015 due to increases in healthcare costs and higher employee headcount.

expenses excluding compensation and benefits professional services expense increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to higher spending on technology services and an increase in fees paid to outsourced service providers and consultants as the company continued to invest in the business. professional services remained relatively flat in 2015 compared to 2014.
occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2016 and 2015 from the prior year primarily due to increased software maintenance expense relating to the company's information technology systems and an increase in property taxes and rent attributable to the ongoing growth in the company's geographic footprint.
advertising and market development, communications, and depreciation and amortization expenses combined grew a modest 4% in 2016 and 6% in 2015, from the prior years as a result of growth in the business, new product media campaigns and higher amortization of internally developed software associated with the company's investment in software and technology enhancements.
the company's capital expenditures were $353 million, $285 million, and $405 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. the increase in capital expenditures in 2016 from 2015 was primarily due to higher investment in land and internal-use software, partially offset by a decrease in investment in buildings. the decrease in capital expenditures in 2015 from 2014 was primarily due to lower investment in buildings and land relating to the growth in the company's geographic footprint beginning in 2014. capitalized costs for developing internal-use software were $130 million, $107 million, and $81 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014.
other expense increased in 2016 and 2015 from the prior year primarily due to an increase in the company's fdic insurance assessments which rose as a result of higher bank deposits and the effect of a new surcharge that commenced in the third quarter of 2016.
taxes on income the company's effective income tax rate was 36.9% in 2016, 36.5% in 2015, and 37.5% in 2014. the 2016 effective income tax rate includes tax benefits on tax exempt income from investments in u.s. state and municipal securities.
the 2015 effective income tax rate includes the recognition of net tax benefits relating to certain current and prior-year matters.
segment information the company provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments - investor services and advisor services. the investor services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services, retirement plan services, and other corporate brokerage services. the advisor services segment provides custodial, trading, banking, and support services as well as retirement business services. revenues and expenses are attributed to the company's two segments based on which segment services the client. the company evaluates the performance of its segments on a pre-tax basis. segment assets and liabilities are not used for evaluating segment performance or in deciding how to allocate resources to segments. net revenues in both segments are generated from the underlying client assets and trading activity; differences in the composition of net revenues between the segments are based on the composition of client assets, client trading frequency, and pricing unique to each. while both segments leverage the scale and efficiency of the company's platforms, segment expenses reflect the dynamics of serving millions of clients in investor services versus the thousands of rias on the advisor platform.

(1)   the corporate brokerage retirement services business was transferred from the investor services segment to the advisor services segment in the fourth quarter of 2015. prior period information has been recast to reflect these changes.
investor services net revenues increased by $640 million, or 13%, in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees. net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher balances of interest-earning assets and higher interest rates on those assets. asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to higher net yields on money market fund assets, partially offset by a reduction in client assets in mutual fund onesource®. expenses excluding interest increased by $290 million, or 9%, in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to growth in the business resulting in increases in compensation and benefits, depreciation and amortization, and occupancy and equipment expenses.
net revenues increased by $174 million, or 4%, in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue, asset management and administration fees, and other revenue, partially offset by a decrease in trading revenue. net interest revenue increased mainly due to higher balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the effect of lower net interest margins.

asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to fees from advice solutions, which increased mainly due to growth in client assets enrolled in advisory offers. other revenue increased primarily due to litigation proceeds relating to the company's non-agency rmbs portfolio. trading revenue decreased in 2015 from 2014 largely due to lower commissions per revenue trade and lower daily average revenue trades. expenses excluding interest increased by $153 million, or 5%, in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to growth in the business resulting in increases in compensation and benefits and other expenses.
advisor services net revenues increased by $458 million, or 28%, in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees. net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher balances of interest-earning assets and higher interest rates on those assets. this growth in assets was bolstered by the migration of more uninvested client cash balances in the segment to schwab bank. asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to higher net yields on money market fund assets. expenses excluding interest increased by $94 million, or 9%, in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to increases in growth in the business resulting in increases in compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment, and other expenses.
net revenues increased by $199 million, or 14%, in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue, asset management and administration fees, and other revenue. net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the effect of lower net interest margins. interest-earning assets have grown due to growth in brokerage client cash swept to schwab bank. asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to higher net yields on money market fund assets and growth in client assets in equity and bond funds. other revenue increased primarily due to litigation proceeds relating to the company's non-agency rmbs portfolio. expenses excluding interest increased by $73 million, or 8%, in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to increases in growth in the business resulting in increases in compensation and benefits, advertising and marketing, other expenses.
unallocated other revenue decreased in 2015 from 2014 due to a net insurance settlement of $45 million in 2014.
expenses excluding interest decreased in 2015 from 2014 as a result of a $68 million charge in 2014 for estimated future severance benefits resulting from changes in the company's geographic footprint.
risk management the company's business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including operational, credit, market, liquidity, and compliance risk. the company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. despite the company's efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks.
the company's risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting and risk mitigation. the activities and organizations that comprise the risk management process are described below.
culture the board of directors has approved an enterprise risk management (erm) framework that incorporates the company's purpose, vision, and values that form the bedrock of its corporate culture and set the tone for the organization.
the erm framework and governance structure constitute a comprehensive approach to managing risks encountered by the company in its business activities. the framework incorporates key concepts commensurate with the size, risk profile, complexity, and continuing growth of the company. risk appetite, which is defined as the amount of risk the company is

willing to accept in pursuit of its corporate strategy, is developed by executive management and approved by the board of directors.
risk governance senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring, and controlling risks.
the global risk committee, which is comprised of senior executives from each major business and control function, is responsible for the oversight of risk management. this includes identifying emerging risks, assessing risk management practices and the control environment, reinforcing business accountability for risk management, supervisory controls and regulatory compliance, supporting resource prioritization across the company, and escalating significant issues to the board of directors.
the company has established risk metrics and reporting that enable measurement of the impact of strategy execution against risk appetite. the risk metrics, with risk limits and tolerance levels, are established for key risk categories by the global risk committee and its functional risk sub-committees.
the global risk committee reports regularly to the risk committee of the board of directors. the risk committee in turn assists the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the company's risk management program, including approving risk appetite statements and reviewing reports relating to risk issues from functional areas of risk management, legal, compliance, and internal audit.
functional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report to the global risk committee. these sub-committees include the:
·   asset-liability management and pricing committee - establishes strategies and policies for the management of corporate capital, liquidity, interest rate risk, and investments;

·   compliance risk committee - provides oversight of compliance risk management programs and policies providing an aggregate view of compliance risk exposure;

·   credit and market risk oversight committee - provides oversight of and approves credit and market risk policies, limits, and exposures in loan, investment, and positioning portfolios;

·   new products and services risk oversight committee - provides oversight of, and approves corporate policy and procedures relating to the risk governance of new products and services; and

·   operational risk oversight committee - provides oversight of and approves operational risk management policies, risk tolerance levels, and operational risk governance processes, and includes sub-committees covering fiduciary, data, information security, model governance, and third-party risk.

senior management has also created an incentive compensation risk oversight committee, which establishes policy and reviews and approves the annual risk assessment of incentive compensation plans, and reports directly to the board compensation committee.
the company's compliance, finance, internal audit, legal, and corporate risk management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring the company's risk management.
in addition, the company's disclosure committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the company's disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. the disclosure committee reports on this evaluation to the ceo and cfo prior to their certification required by sections 302 and 906 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002.

operational risk operational risks arise due to potentially inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events and relationships impacting the company and/or any of its key business partners and third-parties. while operational risk is inherent in all business activities, the company relies on a system of internal controls and risk management practices designed to keep operational risk and operational losses within the company's risk appetite. the company has specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and uses periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. where appropriate, the company manages the impact of operational loss and litigation expense through the purchase of insurance. the insurance program is specifically designed to address the key operational risks of the company, and to maintain compliance with local laws and regulation.
the company's operations are highly dependent on the integrity and resiliency of its critical business functions and technology systems. to the extent the company experiences business or system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, technological failure, cyber attacks, changes to systems, linkages with third-party systems, and power failures), the company's business and operations could be negatively impacted. to minimize business interruptions, the company maintains a backup and recovery infrastructure which includes facilities for backup and communications, a geographically dispersed workforce, and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans.
information security risk is the potential for unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, perusal, inspection, recording or destruction of the company's information or systems. the company has designed and implemented an information security program that knits together complementary tools, controls and technologies to protect systems, client accounts and data. the company continuously monitors the systems and works collaboratively with government agencies, law enforcement and other financial institutions to address potential threats. the company uses advanced monitoring systems to identify suspicious activity and deter unauthorized access by internal or external actors. the company limits the number of employees who have access to clients' personal information and enforces internal authentication measures to protect against the potential for social engineering. all employees who handle sensitive information are trained in privacy and security. schwab's fraud and cyber security teams monitor activity looking for suspicious behavior. these capabilities allow the company to identify and quickly act on any attempted intrusions.
the company also faces operational risk when it employs the services of various external vendors, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. the company manages its exposure to external vendor risk through contractual provisions, control standards, and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance. the company maintains policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with company data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non-public client information. the company clearly defines for employees, contractors, and vendors the company's expected standards of care for confidential data. regular training is provided by the company in regard to data security.
fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. the company attempts to manage this risk by establishing procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the procedures applicable to their business. guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees.
model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. models are owned by several business units throughout the company, and are used for a variety of purposes. model use includes, but is not limited to, calculating capital requirements for hypothetical stressful environments, estimating interest and credit risk for loans and other balance sheet assets, and providing guidance in the management of client portfolios. the company has established a policy to describe the roles and responsibilities of all key stakeholders in model development, management, and use. all models at the company are registered in a centralized database and classified into different risk

(tabular amounts in millions, except ratios, or as noted)
ratings depending on their potential financial, reputational, or regulatory impact to the company. the model risk rating determines the scope of model governance activities.
compliance risk the company faces significant compliance risk in its business, that is, the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, fines or penalties, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from the failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, or other regulatory requirements. among other things, compliance risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for company products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of the company's controls. the company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, including sros. such regulation is becoming increasingly extensive and complex, and regulatory proceedings and sanctions against financial services firms continue to increase.
the company attempts to manage compliance risk through policies, procedures and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. these procedures address issues such as business conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, client privacy, and employment policies. despite the company's efforts to maintain an effective compliance program and internal controls, legal breaches and rule violations could result in reputational harm, significant losses and disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on the company's business activities.
credit and concentration risk credit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform on its contractual obligations. the company's exposure to credit risk mainly results from margin lending and client option and futures activities, securities lending activities, mortgage lending activities, pledged asset lending, its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and other investing activities. to manage the risks of such losses, the company has established policies and procedures, which include establishing and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin, pal, option, and futures requirements for certain securities. collateral arrangements relating to margin loans, pals, option positions, securities lending agreements, and resale agreements include provisions that require additional collateral in the event market fluctuations result in declines in the value of collateral received. additionally, for margin loan, pal and securities lending agreements, collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral exceeds the amounts loaned.
schwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if schwab's clients or a counterparty fail to meet their obligations to schwab.
the company's bank loan portfolio includes first mortgages, helocs, pals and other loans. the credit risk exposure related to loans is actively managed through individual loan and portfolio reviews. management regularly reviews asset quality, including concentrations, delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. all are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for loan losses.
the company's residential loan underwriting guidelines include maximum ltv ratios, cash out limits, and minimum fair isaac corporation (fico) credit scores. the specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan size is conforming or jumbo).
the company does not originate or purchase residential loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a fico score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors.
the company's bank loans include $8.2 billion of adjustable rate first mortgage loans at december 31, 2016. the company's adjustable rate mortgages have initial fixed interest rates for three to ten years and interest rates that adjust

annually thereafter. approximately 36% of these mortgages consisted of loans with interest-only payment terms. the interest rates on approximately 58% of these interest-only loans are not scheduled to reset for three or more years. the company's mortgage loans do not include interest terms described as temporary introductory rates below current market rates.
the company's heloc product has a 30-year loan term with an initial draw period of ten years from the date of origination. after the initial draw period, the balance outstanding at such time is converted to a 20-year amortizing loan. the interest rate during the initial draw period and the 20-year amortizing period is a floating rate based on the prime rate plus a margin. helocs that convert to an amortizing loan may experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates than those in the initial draw period. the company's allowance for loan loss methodology takes this increased inherent risk into consideration.
the following table presents when current outstanding helocs will convert to amortizing loans:

december 31, 2016                                   balance converted to amortizing loan by period end        $469

total                                           $2,350
at december 31, 2016, $1.8 billion of the heloc portfolio was secured by second liens on the associated properties. second lien mortgage loans typically possess a higher degree of credit risk given the subordination to the first lien holder in the event of default. in addition to the credit monitoring activities described previously, the company also monitors credit risk by reviewing the delinquency status of the first lien loan on the associated property. at december 31, 2016, approximately 39% of the heloc borrowers that had a balance only paid the minimum amount of interest due.
for more information on the company's credit quality indicators relating to its bank loans, see item 8 - note 6.
the company has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios, which include u.s. agency, and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, u.s. agency notes, u.s. treasury securities, certificates of deposit, u.s. state and municipal securities, and commercial paper.
at december 31, 2016, substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade. u.s. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the u.s. government-sponsored enterprises.
the company has exposure to concentration risk when holding large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or within a particular industry or geographical area.
the fair value of the company's investments in mortgage-backed securities totaled $105.9 billion at december 31, 2016. of these, $104.9 billion were issued by u.s. agencies and $1.0 billion were issued by private entities (non-agency securities).
the fair value of the company's investments in asset-backed securities totaled $21.3 billion at december 31, 2016. schwab holds $10.1 billion floating rate federal family education loan program asset-backed securities (ffelp abs). beginning in 2015, two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations began placing a portion of ffelp abs on review for downgrade. at december 31, 2016, five securities with an aggregate fair value of $1.2 billion were below investment grade. both agencies have indicated that additional classes could be downgraded below investment grade due to the risk that some remainder of the securities could be outstanding after their legal final maturity dates. the timing of ffelp abs principal payment is inherently uncertain given the variety of payment options available to student loan borrowers. loans collateralizing these securities continue to be covered by a guarantee from the department of education of at least 97% of principal and interest. the company holds only senior class notes that have additional credit enhancement of 3% or more

(tabular amounts in millions, except ratios, or as noted)
that, together with the department of education guarantee, provide 100% or more credit enhancement. the company has an independent credit assessment function and does not consider these securities to be impaired because it expects full payment of principal and interest. therefore, the company continues to assign them the highest internal credit rating.
the fair value of the company's investments in corporate debt securities and commercial paper totaled $10.6 billion at december 31, 2016, with 48% issued by institutions in the financial services industry. these securities are included in afs securities, cash and cash equivalents, and other securities owned in the company's consolidated balance sheets. issuer, geographic, and sector concentrations are controlled by established credit policy limits to each concentration type.
foreign holdings at december 31, 2016, the company had exposure to non-sovereign financial and non-financial institutions in foreign countries of $6.8 billion, with the fair value of the top three exposures being to issuers and counterparties domiciled in france at $1.9 billion, sweden at $1.3 billion and australia at $1.0 billion. the company has no direct exposure to sovereign foreign governments. the company does not have unfunded commitments to counterparties in foreign countries, nor does it have exposure as a result of credit default protection purchased or sold separately as of december 31, 2016.
in addition to the direct holdings in foreign companies, the company has indirect exposure to foreign countries through its investments in csim money market funds (collectively, the funds) resulting from brokerage clearing activities. at december 31, 2016, the company had $108 million in investments in these funds. certain of the funds' positions include certificates of deposits, time deposits, commercial paper and corporate debt securities issued by counterparties in foreign countries. additionally, at december 31, 2016, the company had outstanding margin loans to foreign residents of $366 million, which are fully collateralized.
market risk market risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by the company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, or market conditions.
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on its interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources that finance these assets. the majority of the company's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. a portion of the company's investment portfolios is sensitive to changes in long-term interest rates.
net interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may reprice at different times or by different amounts, and the spread between short and long-term interest rates. interest-earning assets primarily include investment securities, margin loans and bank loans. these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment. because the company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin loans and bank loans, and controls the composition of its investment securities, it has some ability to manage its net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions.
to mitigate the risk of declining interest revenue, the company has established policies and procedures, which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk, and monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interest-earning assets and funding sources. to remain within these guidelines, the company manages the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios.
financial instruments held by the company are also subject to the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument. the company is indirectly exposed to option, futures, and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option and futures accounts, securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers, and client securities loaned out as part of the company's brokerage securities lending activities. equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity, margin borrowing, and overall client
- 41 -
the charles schwab corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
(tabular amounts in millions, except ratios, or as noted)
engagement with the company. additionally, the company earns mutual fund and etf service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets. fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue earned by the company.
the company's market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material.
net interest revenue simulation for the company's net interest revenue sensitivity analysis, the company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. the simulation includes all interest-sensitive assets and liabilities. key variables in the simulation include the repricing of financial instruments, prepayment, reinvestment, and product pricing assumptions. the company uses constant balances and market rates in the simulation assumptions in order to minimize the number of variables and to better isolate risks. the simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue. actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies, including changes in asset and liability mix.
if the company's guidelines for its net interest revenue sensitivity are breached, management must report the breach to the company's corporate asset-liability management and pricing committee and establish a plan to address the interest rate risk. there were no breaches of the company's net interest revenue sensitivity guidelines during the years ended december 31, 2016 or 2015.
as represented by the simulations presented below, the company's investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall.
the simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. as the company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood the company would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment. the following table shows the simulated net interest revenue change over the next 12 months beginning december 31, 2016 and 2015 of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period.

december 31,                         2016             2015
increase of 100 basis points          6.5   %          8.2   %
decrease of 100 basis points        (9.8)   %        (9.5)   %
the change in net interest revenue sensitivities as of december 31, 2016 reflects the increase in interest rates across all terms. the low client deposit rates under current federal fund levels limits the extent to which the company can reduce interest expense paid on funding sources. a decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the company's investment and loan portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense, further compressing net interest margin. the increase of short-term interest rates positively impacts net interest revenue as yields on interest-earning assets rise faster than the cost of funding sources.
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the potential that the company will be unable to sell assets or meet cash flow obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses.
due to its role as a source of financial strength, csc's liquidity needs are primarily driven by the liquidity and capital needs of the brokerage subsidiaries, the capital needs of schwab bank, the amount of dividend payments on csc's common and preferred stock and principal and interest due on corporate debt. the liquidity needs of its brokerage subsidiaries are
- 42 -
the charles schwab corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
(tabular amounts in millions, except ratios, or as noted)
primarily driven by client activity including trading and margin borrowing activities and capital expenditures, and the capital needs of its bank subsidiary are primarily driven by client deposits.
the company has established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of its business strategies, while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet its operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stress conditions. the company seeks to maintain client confidence in its balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the company to meet its obligations. to this end, the company has established limits and contingency funding scenarios to support liquidity levels during both expected and stressed scenarios.
the company employs a variety of methodologies to monitor and manage liquidity. the company conducts regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure the company's ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific liquidity stress events. liquidity is also tested at key subsidiaries and results are reported on a monthly basis to the company's corporate asset-liability management and pricing committee. a number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the company and are reviewed with management as appropriate.
beginning on january 1, 2016, the company became subject to the modified lcr rule, which was fully phased in on january 1, 2017 and requires csc to hold hqlas equal to at least 70% of projected net cash outflows over a 30-day period, as defined by the rule. at december 31, 2016, the company was in compliance with the fully phased-in modified lcr rule.
primary funding sources the company's primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity: bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts. in 2016, bank deposits swept from brokerage accounts increased $33.0 billion. these funds were used to purchase investment securities, thereby funding a significant portion of the 22% growth in the company's consolidated balance sheet.
other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, repayments on loans, securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts, and cash provided by external financing or equity offerings.
to meet daily funding needs, the company maintains liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments. for unanticipated liquidity needs, the company maintains a buffer of highly liquid investments, currently comprised of u.s. treasury notes.
additional funding sources in addition to internal sources of liquidity, the company has sources of external funding. csc maintains a $750 million committed, unsecured credit facility with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in june 2017. other than an overnight borrowing to test the availability of this facility, it was unused during 2016. the funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes. the financial covenants require schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, schwab bank to be well capitalized, and csc to maintain a minimum level of stockholders' equity, adjusted to exclude aoci. at december 31, 2016, the minimum level of stockholders' equity required under this facility was $10.2 billion (csc's stockholders' equity, excluding aoci, at december 31, 2016 was $16.6 billion). management believes these restrictions will not have a material effect on csc's ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements.
csc and schwab also have access to uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines with several banks. the need for short-term borrowings from these sources arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interest-earning investments, and movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements. these lines were not used by csc during 2016. schwab used such borrowings for one day in 2016, for $15 million and there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at december 31, 2016.

to partially satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the options clearing corporation, the broker-dealer subsidiaries have unsecured standby letter of credit agreements (locs) with several banks in favor of the options clearing corporation aggregating $295 million at december 31, 2016. there were no funds drawn under any of these locs during 2016 or 2015. in connection with its securities lending activities, the company is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. the collateral requirements were satisfied by providing cash as collateral.
schwab bank has access to short-term secured funding through the federal reserve's discount window. amounts available under the federal reserve discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain of schwab bank's investment securities that are pledged as collateral. schwab bank maintains policies and procedures necessary to access this funding and tests discount window borrowing procedures on a periodic basis. at december 31, 2016, $849 million was available under this arrangement. schwab bank used such borrowings for one day during 2016 for $1 million and there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at december 31, 2016.
schwab bank also maintains a secured credit facility with the federal home loan bank of san francisco (fhlb). amounts available under this facility are dependent on the amount of schwab bank's first mortgages, helocs, and the fair value of certain of schwab bank's investment securities that are pledged as collateral. schwab bank maintains policies and procedures necessary to access this funding and tests borrowing procedures on a periodic basis. during 2016, schwab bank used borrowings under this agreement to purchase investment securities prior to bulk transfers. as the bulk transfers were completed, the proceeds were used to pay down advances. there were no amounts outstanding under this facility at december 31, 2016 with $16.5 billion available based on the loans and securities currently pledged. this credit facility is also available as backup financing in the event of unexpected client cash outflow from schwab bank's balance sheet.
csc has authorization from its board of directors to issue unsecured commercial paper notes (commercial paper notes) not to exceed $1.5 billion. management has set a current limit for the commercial paper program not to exceed the amount of the committed, unsecured credit facility, which was $750 million at december 31, 2016. the maturities of the commercial paper notes may vary, but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue. the commercial paper is not redeemable prior to maturity and cannot be voluntarily prepaid. the proceeds of the commercial paper program are to be used for general corporate purposes. csc's ratings for these short-term borrowings are p1 by moody's, a1 by standard & poor's, and f1 by fitch. csc had no commercial paper notes outstanding at december 31, 2016 or 2015.
csc had long-term debt of $2.9 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015 bearing a weighted-average interest rate of 3.37%. csc has a universal automatic shelf registration statement (shelf registration statement) on file with the sec, which enables it to issue debt, equity, and other securities.
on march 10, 2015, csc issued $625 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes that mature in 2018 and $375 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes that mature in 2025. the senior notes due 2018 and 2025 have a fixed interest rate of 1.50% and 3.00%, respectively, with interest payable semi-annually. additionally, on november 13, 2015, csc issued $350 million aggregate amount of 3.450% senior notes that mature in 2026, with interest payable semi-annually.
the following are details of csc's senior and medium-term notes:

on march 7, 2016, csc completed an equity offering of 30 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of 5.95% non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (series d preferred stock). the net proceeds from the sale were $725 million.
on august 3, 2015, csc completed an equity offering of 24 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of 6.00% non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (series c preferred stock). the net proceeds from the sale were $581 million. csc's preferred stock is rated baa2 by moody's, bbb by standard & poor's and bb+ by fitch.
for further discussion of csc's long-term debt and information on the equity offerings, see item 8 - note 13 and note 17.
off-balance sheet arrangements the company enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of its clients. these arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. additionally, the company enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements in the ordinary course of business. for information on each of these arrangements, see item 8 - note 6, note 10, note 13, note 14, and note 15.
contractual obligations the company's principal contractual obligations as of december 31, 2016 are shown in the following table. management believes that funds generated by its continuing operations, as well as cash provided by external financing, will continue to be the primary funding sources in meeting these obligations. excluded from this table are liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet that are generally short-term in nature (e.g., payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations) or without contractual payment terms (e.g., bank deposits, payables to brokerage clients, and deferred compensation).

capital management the company seeks to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support execution of its business strategy, including anticipated balance sheet growth, providing financial support to its subsidiaries, and sustained access to the capital markets, while at the same time meeting its regulatory capital requirements and serving as a source of financial strength to schwab bank. the company's primary sources of capital are funds generated by the operations of its subsidiaries and securities issuances by csc in the capital markets. to ensure that it has a sufficient amount of capital to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values, the company has adopted a policy to remain well capitalized even in stressed scenarios.
internal guidelines are set, for both the company and its regulated subsidiaries, to ensure capital levels are in line with the company's strategy and regulatory requirements, and capital forecasts are reviewed monthly at capital planning and asset-

liability management and pricing committee meetings. a number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify potential problems that could impact capital. in addition, the company monitors its subsidiaries' capital levels and requirements. subject to regulatory capital requirements and any required approvals, any excess capital held by subsidiaries is transferred to csc in the form of dividends and returns of capital. when subsidiaries have need of additional capital, funds are provided by csc as equity investments and also as subordinated loans (in a form approved as regulatory capital by regulators) for schwab. the details and method used for each cash infusion are based on an analysis of the particular entity's needs and financing alternatives. the amounts and structure of infusions must take into consideration maintenance of regulatory capital requirements, debt/equity ratios, and equity double leverage ratios.
the company conducts regular capital stress testing to assess the potential financial impacts of various adverse macroeconomic and company-specific events to which the company could be subjected. the objective of the company's capital stress testing is (1) to explore various potential outcomes - including rare and extreme events and (2) to assess impacts of potential stressful outcomes on both capital and liquidity. additionally, the company has a comprehensive capital contingency plan to provide action plans for certain low probability/high impact capital events that the company might face. the capital contingency plan is issued under the authority of the asset-liability management and pricing committee and provides guidelines for sustained capital events. it does not specifically address every contingency, but is designed to provide a framework for responding to any capital stress. the results of the stress testing indicate there are two scenarios which could stress the company's capital: (1) inflows of balance sheet cash during a period of very low interest rates and (2) outflows of balance sheet cash when other sources of financing are not available and the company is required to sell assets to fund the flows at a loss. the capital contingency plan is reviewed annually and updated as appropriate.
for additional information, see business - regulation in part i, item 1.
regulatory capital requirements csc is subject to capital requirements set by the federal reserve and is required to serve as a source of strength for schwab bank and to provide financial assistance if schwab bank experiences financial distress. the company is required to maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio for csc of at least 4%; however, management seeks to maintain the ratio of at least 6%. due to the relatively low risk of the company's balance sheet assets and risk-based capital ratios at csc and schwab bank that are well in excess of regulatory requirements, the tier 1 leverage ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint on csc's asset growth.
schwab bank is subject to capital requirements set by the occ that are substantially similar to those imposed on csc by the federal reserve. schwab bank's failure to remain well capitalized could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that could have a direct material effect on the bank. the company is required to maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio for schwab bank of at least 5% to be well capitalized, but seeks to maintain the ratio of at least 6.25%. based on its regulatory capital ratios at december 31, 2016, schwab bank is considered well capitalized.
see item 8 - note 22 for a summary of both csc and schwab bank's capital ratios.

(1)   csc and schwab bank have elected to opt-out of the requirement to include most components of aoci in cet1 capital.
schwab bank is also subject to regulatory requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions. in addition, schwab bank is required to provide notice to, and may be required to obtain approval from, the occ and the federal reserve to declare dividends to csc.
the company's broker-dealer subsidiaries (schwab and optionsxpress) are subject to regulatory requirements of the uniform net capital rule. the rule is intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. these regulations prohibit the broker-dealer subsidiaries from paying cash dividends, making unsecured advances and loans to their parent company and employees, and repaying subordinated borrowings from csc if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement of $250,000. as such, the broker-dealer subsidiaries are required to maintain, at all times, at least the minimum level of net capital required under rule 15c3-1. at december 31, 2016, schwab and optionsxpress met and exceeded their net capital requirements.
in addition to the capital requirements above, the company's subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure financial soundness and liquidity. see item 8 - note 22 for additional information on the components of stockholders' equity and information on the capital requirements of each of the subsidiaries.
dividends since the initial dividend in 1989, csc has paid 111 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the quarterly dividend rate 20 times, resulting in a 20% compounded annual growth rate, excluding the special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share in 2007. while the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the board of directors, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, csc currently targets its common stock cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income.

share repurchases there were no repurchases of csc's common stock in 2016 or 2015. as of december 31, 2016, csc had remaining authority from the board of directors to repurchase up to $596 million of its common stock, which is not subject to expiration.
fair value of financial instruments the company uses the market approach to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, and to determine fair value disclosures. see item 8 - note 2 and note 16 for more information on the company's assets and liabilities recorded at fair value.
when available, the company uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. when utilizing market data and bid-ask spread, the company uses the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. when quoted prices do not exist, the company uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets. the company generally obtains prices from at least three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value. the company's primary independent pricing service provides prices based on observable trades and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar "to-be-issued" securities. the company compares the prices obtained from its primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. the company does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in a material difference in the recorded amounts. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, the company did not adjust prices received from the primary independent third-party pricing service.
critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. while the majority of the company's revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the company's financial position and reported financial results. these critical accounting estimates are described below. management regularly

reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the company's financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy.
other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities the company internally conducts pre-purchase analyses and ongoing, post-purchase monitoring of investments that it owns. the company assigns a risk rating to each issuer of the securities in the company's investment securities portfolio based on these analyses. on an ongoing basis, the company monitors credit indicators related to its securities portfolio and adjusts the internal ratings accordingly.
management evaluates whether investment securities are otti on a quarterly basis. debt securities with unrealized losses are considered otti if the company intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell such security before any anticipated recovery. if management determines that a security is otti under these circumstances, the impairment recognized in earnings is measured as the entire difference between the amortized cost and the then-current fair value.
a security is also otti if management does not expect to recover the amortized cost of the security. in this circumstance, the impairment recognized in earnings represents the estimated credit loss, and is measured by the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost of the security. management utilizes cash flow models to estimate the expected future cash flow from the securities and to estimate the credit loss. expected cash flows are discounted using the security's effective interest rate.
the evaluation of whether the company expects to recover the amortized cost of a security is inherently judgmental. the evaluation includes the consideration of multiple factors including: the magnitude and duration of the unrealized loss; the financial condition of the issuer; the payment structure of the security; external credit ratings; internal credit ratings; for asset-backed securities, the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security to absorb credit losses on the underlying collateral; recent events specific to the issuer and the issuer's industry; and whether the company has received all scheduled principal and interest payments.
valuation of goodwill the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually, or whenever indications of impairment exist. impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, resulting in an impairment charge for this excess. adverse changes in the company's planned business operations such as unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit, or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the company's recorded goodwill.
the company can elect to qualitatively assess goodwill for impairment if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. a qualitative assessment considers macroeconomic and other industry-specific factors, such as trends in short-term and long-term interest rates and the ability to access capital, and company specific factors such as market capitalization in excess of net assets, trends in revenue generating activities, and merger or acquisition activity. if the company elects to bypass qualitatively assessing goodwill, or it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, management estimates the fair values of each of the company's reporting units (defined as the company's businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management) and compares it to their carrying values. the estimated fair values of the reporting units are established using an income approach based on a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit, a market approach which compares each reporting unit to comparable companies in their respective industries, as well as a market capitalization analysis.
the company's annual goodwill impairment testing date is april 1st. in 2016, the company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment. as of april 1, 2016, the company determined through quantitative testing that the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value of each of the company's reporting units, and concluded that goodwill was not impaired.

allowance for loan losses the appropriateness of the allowance is reviewed quarterly by management, taking into consideration current economic conditions, the existing loan portfolio composition, past loss experience, and risks inherent in the portfolios.
the methodology to establish an allowance for loan losses related to the first mortgage and heloc portfolios utilizes statistical models that estimate prepayments, defaults, and probable losses for the loan types based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the types. the methodology considers the effects of borrower behavior and a variety of factors including, but not limited to, interest rates, housing price movements as measured by a housing price index, economic conditions, estimated defaults and foreclosures measured by historical and expected delinquencies, changes in prepayment speeds, ltv ratios, past loss experience, estimates of future loss severities, borrower credit risk, and the adequacy of collateral. the methodology also evaluates concentrations in the loan types, including loan products within those types, year of origination, and geographical distribution of collateral.
probable losses are forecast using a loan-level simulation of the delinquency status of the loans over the term of the loans. the simulation starts with the current relevant risk indicators, including the current delinquent status of each loan, the estimated current ltv ratio of each loan, the term and structure of each loan, current key interest rates including u.s. treasury and libor rates, and borrower fico scores. the more significant variables in the simulation include delinquency roll rates, loss severity, housing prices, and interest rates. delinquency roll rates are estimated from the company's historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information. loss severity estimates are based on the company's historical loss experience and market trends. the estimated loss severity (i.e., loss given default) used in the allowance for loan loss for helocs is higher than that used for first mortgages. housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values. factors affecting the home price index include housing inventory, unemployment, interest rates, and inflation expectations. interest rate projections are based on the current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths. this methodology results in loss factors that are applied to the outstanding balances to determine the allowance for loan loss for each loan type.
legal and regulatory reserves reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, insurance coverage and indemnification, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. in many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available. significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved.
the company's management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee. additionally, management has reviewed with the audit committee the company's significant estimates discussed in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.

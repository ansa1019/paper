item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in "financial statements and supplementary data," as well as the information contained in "risk factors."
unless otherwise stated, the terms "we," "us," "our" and the "company" refer to campbell soup company and its consolidated subsidiaries.
as of the beginning of 2016, we manage our businesses in three divisions focused mainly on product categories. the new divisions, which represent our operating and reportable segments, are as follows: americas simple meals and beverages; global biscuits and snacks; and campbell fresh. see "business - reportable segments" for a description of the products included in each segment. in 2016, we modified our method of allocating pension and postretirement benefit costs to segments. through 2015, we included all components of benefit expense in measuring segment performance. in 2016, only service cost is allocated to segments. all other components of expense, including interest cost, expected return on assets, and recognized actuarial gains and losses, are reflected in corporate and not included in segment operating results.
in 2016, we elected to change our method of accounting for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans and the calculation of expected return on pension plan assets. historically, actuarial gains and losses associated with benefit obligations were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets and were amortized into earnings over the remaining service life of participants to the extent that the amounts were in excess of a corridor. under the new policy, actuarial gains and losses will be recognized immediately in our consolidated statements of earnings as of the measurement date, which is our fiscal year end, or more frequently if an interim remeasurement is required. in addition, we no longer use a market-related value of plan assets, which is an average value, to determine the expected return on assets but rather will use the fair value of plan assets. we believe the new policies will provide greater transparency to ongoing operating results and better reflect the impact of current market conditions on the obligations and assets.
relevant financial information has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the changes in segment reporting and accounting policy.
executive summary we are a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded food and beverage products.
we operate in a highly competitive industry and experience global competition for all of our principal products. the principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, quality, price, advertising, promotion, convenience and service. to grow and maintain our market positions, we focus on bringing new products and innovations to market that meet evolving consumer needs and preferences, while maintaining the quality and appeal of our existing products. we continue to optimize our manufacturing
14
and other operations and invest in our brands through ongoing research and development, advertising, marketing and consumer promotions.
over the last several years, we have diversified our product offerings through several acquisitions and enhanced our focus through a divestiture. in 2013, we acquired bolthouse farms and plum. in 2014, we acquired kelsen and divested our european simple meals business. in 2015, we completed the acquisition of the assets of garden fresh gourmet. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our recent acquisitions, and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our divestiture of the european simple meals business.
industry trends our businesses are being influenced by a variety of trends that we anticipate will continue in the future, including changing demographics, consumer tastes, opinions and behaviors. millennials and generation z are replacing baby boomers as the key influencers of societal and cultural norms in the u.s. in addition, there is a leveling or shrinking middle class in developed markets, while there is a growing middle class in developing markets.
consumers increasingly seek products that they deem healthy, including fresh, organic and functional foods. while demanding products with these qualities, consumers have become more distrustful of large corporations and other large institutions. traditional retailers are responding by developing small format and "neighborhood" stores and expanding shelf space for purpose-driven brands. consumers also continue to gravitate toward value offerings, which is demonstrated by the increase in lower-priced retailers, such as dollar stores, and the growth of private-label offerings.
digital technology is changing the way consumers purchase food. although e-commerce represents only a small percent of total food sales today, we anticipate it will accelerate rapidly through the growth of pure-play e-tailers, increased focus of brick and mortar retailers on e-commerce and the mainstreaming of meal delivery services. consumers are also increasingly using digital technology to customize their diets for their individual lifestyle, physiology and health goals.
key strategies our long-term goal is to build shareholder value by driving sustainable, profitable net sales growth. guided by our purpose - real food that matters for life's moments, we are pursuing a dual strategy of strengthening our core businesses while expanding into faster-growing spaces.
new structure in 2016, we implemented a new enterprise design that better aligns with our dual strategy. under the new structure, our divisions are now organized in three segments focused mainly on product categories: americas simple meals and beverages; global biscuits and snacks; and campbell fresh. in support of our new structure, we designed and implemented a new integrated global services (igs) organization to deliver shared services and cost savings across the company. we are also pursuing other initiatives to reduce costs, such as adopting zero-based budgeting over time. in total, we expect our cost savings initiatives to generate approximately $300 million in annual cost savings by the end of fiscal 2018. these savings are above and beyond our existing supply-chain productivity initiatives. we expect to reinvest a portion of these savings into the businesses during 2017. see "restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives" for additional information on these initiatives.
strategic imperatives with this new enterprise design in place, we are responding to the above-described industry trends by continuing to focus on four key strategic imperatives:
•   elevating trust through real food, transparency and sustainability;
•   building our digital marketing and e-commerce capabilities;
•   diversifying our portfolio in health and well-being; and
•   expanding our presence in developing markets over time.
elevating trust through real food, transparency and sustainability our focus is to strengthen the trust of our consumers and customers that our products are real food made with desirable ingredients and crafted using ethical sourcing and sustainable practices. we continue to do this by changing recipes or removing ingredients from our food, such as artificial flavors and colors. our www.whatsinmyfood.com website promotes transparency by providing consumers with a wide range of details about how many of our foods and beverages are made and the choices behind the ingredients we use in those products. this site includes all of our major products in the u.s. and canada, with designs to expand globally over the next two fiscal years. in addition, we support and remain committed to mandatory national genetically modified organism labeling.
15
building digital marketing and e-commerce we are responding to the growing consumer shift to digital and mobile technologies by focusing a larger percentage of our marketing efforts on digital marketing and e-commerce. we believe these efforts will position us well to grow with the expanding e-commerce market. although we are shifting our marketing efforts to digital and mobile platforms, we continue to pursue a multi-channel approach to ensure our products are available to consumers at traditional storefront retailers, as well as online retailers.
diversifying our portfolio in health and well-being capitalizing on recent consumer and retailer trends in health and well-being, we are increasing our focus on fresh and healthy foods. we plan to expand our product offerings in key growth areas, such as in the packaged fresh category and with organic and clean label products. in addition, we will focus on naturally functional foods by leveraging our vegetable and whole grain capabilities.
expanding presence in developing markets over time we plan to focus on expanding our presence in developing markets, especially our global biscuits and snacks business in asia. we will aim to increase the household penetration and frequency of purchase of our iconic brands, goldfish, kjeldsens and tim tam, in their home markets while expanding into new geographies.
to support these four imperatives, we will continue to pursue different models of innovation, including smart external development, disciplined mergers and acquisitions, strategic partnerships and venture investing.
summary of results this summary of results provides significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows.
•   there were 52 weeks in 2016 and 2015. there were 53 weeks in 2014.
•   net sales decreased 1% in 2016 to $7.961 billion, primarily due to the impact of currency translation and lower volume, partially offset by the acquisition of garden fresh gourmet and higher selling prices.
•   gross profit, as a percent of sales, increased to 34.9% from 34.4% a year ago. the increase was primarily due to productivity improvements and higher selling prices, partially offset by increased losses on pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market adjustments, and cost inflation, supply chain costs and other factors.
•   administrative expenses increased 7% to $641 million from $601 million a year ago. the increase was primarily due to increased losses on pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market adjustments, and higher costs related to the implementation of the new organizational structure and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by benefits from cost savings initiatives. excluding losses on pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market adjustments and costs related to the implementation of new organizational structure and cost savings initiatives, administrative expenses decreased due to the benefits from cost savings initiatives, partially offset by inflation.
•   other expenses / (income) increased to $131 million in 2016 from $24 million in 2015, primarily due to a non-cash impairment charge on the intangible assets of the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit, partially offset by a gain from the settlement of a claim related to the kelsen acquisition.
•   earnings per share were $1.81 in 2016, compared to $2.13 a year ago. the current and prior year included expenses of $1.13 and $.53 per share, respectively, from items impacting comparability as discussed below.
•   cash flow from operations was $1.463 billion in 2016, compared to $1.182 billion in 2015. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to higher cash earnings and lower working capital requirements.
net earnings attributable to campbell soup company - 2016 compared with 2015
the following items impacted the comparability of earnings and earnings per share:
•   in 2015, we implemented a new enterprise design and initiatives to reduce costs and to streamline our organizational structure. in 2016, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $35 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $47 million in administrative expenses related to these initiatives. in 2016, we also recorded a reduction to pre-tax restructuring charges of $4 million related to the 2014 initiatives. the aggregate after-tax impact in 2016 of restructuring charges, implementation costs and other related costs was $49 million, or $.16 per share. in 2015, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $102 million and implementation costs of $22 million recorded in administrative expenses related to the 2015 initiatives (aggregate impact of $78 million after tax, or $.25 per share). see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements and "restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives" for additional information;
•   in 2016, we recognized losses of $313 million in costs and expenses ($200 million after tax, or $.64 per share) associated with mark-to-market adjustments for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans. in 2015, we recognized losses of $138 million in costs and expenses ($87 million after tax, or $.28 per share) associated with mark-to-market adjustments for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans;
16
•   in 2016, we recorded a gain of $25 million ($.08 per share) in other expenses / (income) from a settlement of a claim related to the kelsen acquisition. the claim was for a warranty breach and has no meaningful ongoing impact on kelsen; and
•   in the fourth quarter of 2016, as part of our annual review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $141 million in other expenses / (income) ($127 million after tax, or $.41 per share) on the intangible assets of the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit, which is part of the campbell fresh segment. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

(1)   the sum of the individual per share amounts may not add due to rounding.
earnings from continuing operations were $666 million ($2.13 per share) in 2015, compared to $785 million ($2.48 per share) in 2014. the additional week contributed approximately $25 million ($.08 per share) to earnings from continuing operations in 2014. after adjusting for the 53rd week and other items impacting comparability, earnings decreased primarily due to a lower gross margin percentage and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by an increase in sales on a constant currency basis, lower marketing and selling expenses, lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate. currency translation had a negative impact of $.06 on earnings per share in 2015. earnings per share benefited from a reduction in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding, primarily due to share repurchases under our strategic share repurchase program.
we sold our european simple meals business on october 28, 2013. see "discontinued operations" for additional information.
net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests we own a 60% controlling interest in a joint venture formed with swire pacific limited to support the development of our soup and broth business in china. the joint venture began operations on january 31, 2011. in 2014, together with our joint venture partner, we agreed to restructure manufacturing and streamline operations for our soup and broth business in china. the after-tax restructuring charge attributable to the noncontrolling interest was $5 million.
we own a 70% controlling interest in a malaysian food products manufacturing company.
in addition, beginning in 2016, we own a 99.8% interest in acre venture partners, l.p., a limited partnership formed to make venture capital investments in innovative new companies in food and food-related industries. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the noncontrolling interests' share in the net earnings (loss) was included in net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of earnings.

in 2016, americas simple meals and beverages sales decreased 2%. sales decreased primarily due to declines in soup and v8 beverages, partially offset by gains in prego pasta sauces, plum products and pace mexican sauces. u.s. soup sales decreased 4% primarily as a result of the impact of our net price realization actions and category declines, which were partly related to warmer weather. further details of u.s. soup include:
•   sales of condensed soups were comparable to the prior year.
•   sales of ready-to-serve soups declined 13%. the sales decrease in ready-to-serve soups was also due to marketing execution issues on campbell's chunky soups.
•   broth sales increased 1%.
v8 beverages continued to be under pressure from competition from specialty and packaged fresh beverages.
in 2015, americas simple meals and beverages sales decreased 2%. u.s. soup sales declined 3%, with 1% due to the impact of the 53rd week. further details of u.s. soup include:
•   sales of condensed soups decreased 3%, with declines in both eating and cooking varieties. lower volumes were partially offset by higher selling prices and reduced promotional spending.
•   sales of ready-to-serve soups decreased 5%.
•   broth sales increased 3% due to gains in aseptically-packaged broth, partially offset by declines in canned broth.
sales of u.s. beverages decreased 5%, primarily due to declines in v8 v-fusion beverages and v8 vegetable juice, partially offset by gains in v8 splash beverages. our u.s. beverages continued to be under pressure from category weakness in shelf-stable juices, as well as from competition from specialty beverages and packaged fresh juices. sales of other u.s. simple meals increased 5%, primarily due to growth in prego pasta sauces, plum products and campbell's dinner sauces, partially offset by lower sales in other simple meal products. in canada, sales decreased due to the negative impact of currency translation.
in 2016, global biscuits and snacks sales decreased 3% reflecting a 4% negative impact from currency translation. excluding the negative impact of currency translation, segment sales increased primarily due to gains in pepperidge farm goldfish crackers and arnott's biscuits in australia, partially offset by declines in kelsen.
in 2015, global biscuits and snacks sales decreased 3%. in arnott's, sales decreased primarily due to the impact of currency translation. excluding the negative impact of currency translation, sales of arnott's products increased due to volume gains and higher selling prices in australia and indonesia. pepperidge farm sales declined primarily due to the impact of the 53rdweek. excluding the impact of the 53rdweek, pepperidge farm sales increased due to gains in fresh bakery, and crackers and cookies,

partially offset by declines in frozen products. sales of simple meals and beverages in the asia pacific region declined due to the negative impact of currency translation and the 53rd week.
in 2016, campbell fresh sales increased 5% primarily due to the acquisition of garden fresh gourmet, which was acquired on june 29, 2015. excluding the acquisition, sales declined reflecting lower sales in carrots and carrot ingredients, partially offset by gains in refrigerated beverages and salad dressings. in 2016, carrot sales performance primarily reflected the adverse impact of weather conditions on crop yields, and execution issues in response to those conditions, which led to customer dissatisfaction and a loss of business in the second half of the year. the increase in refrigerated beverages was primarily due to new product launches, partially offset by the impact of the voluntary recall of bolthouse farms protein plus drinks in june. in 2016, promotional spending was increased to remain competitive and to support new product launches.
in 2015, campbell fresh sales increased 1%. excluding the impact of the 53rd week, sales increased primarily due to gains in bolthouse premium refrigerated beverages and salad dressings; and the acquisition of garden fresh gourmet, which was acquired on june 29, 2015; partially offset by declines in bolthouse carrots and carrot ingredients.

earnings from americas simple meals and beverages increased 13% in 2016 versus 2015. the increase was primarily due to a higher gross margin percentage, benefiting from productivity improvements and increased net price realization, as well as lower marketing and selling expenses, partially offset by volume declines.
earnings from americas simple meals and beverages decreased 8% in 2015 versus 2014. the decrease was due to cost inflation and higher supply chain costs, unfavorable product mix, and the impact of the 53rd week, partially offset by productivity improvements, lower marketing expenses, higher selling prices and the benefit of lapping the plum recall in 2014.
earnings from global biscuits and snacks increased 10% in 2016 versus 2015. the increase was primarily due to a higher gross margin percentage, volume gains, lower selling expenses and lower administrative expenses, partly offset by the negative impact of currency translation and higher advertising and consumer promotion expenses.

earnings from campbell fresh decreased 10% in 2015 versus 2014. the decrease was primarily due to cost inflation and higher supply chain costs, partially offset by favorable product mix and productivity improvements. the increase in cost inflation and higher supply chain costs reflected higher carrot costs due in part to adverse weather.
corporate in 2016 included a $313 million loss associated with pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market adjustments, a non-cash impairment charge of $141 million on the intangible assets of the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit, costs of $47 million related to the implementation of our new organizational structure and cost savings initiatives, and a $25 million gain from a settlement of a claim related to the kelsen acquisition. corporate in 2015 included a $138 million loss associated with pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market adjustments and costs of $22 million related to the implementation of our new organizational structure and cost savings initiatives. the remaining increase was primarily due to an increase in pension benefit cost, resulting from a reduction in expected return on assets partially offset by lower interest cost.
corporate in 2014 included a $31 million loss associated with pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market adjustments, a $9 million loss on foreign exchange forward contracts related to the sale of the european simple meals business, and $3 million of restructuring-related costs. the remaining decrease was primarily due to a reduction in pension and postretirement benefit interest cost, net of expected return on assets, and lower losses on open commodity hedges in 2015.
interest expense/income interest expense increased to $115 million in 2016 from $108 million in 2015, reflecting higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio, partially offset by lower average levels of debt.

restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives
2015 initiatives on january 29, 2015, we announced plans to implement a new enterprise design focused mainly on product categories. under the new structure, which we fully implemented at the beginning of 2016, our businesses are organized in the following divisions: americas simple meals and beverages, global biscuits and snacks, and campbell fresh.
in support of the new structure, we designed and implemented a new igs organization to deliver shared services across the company. we also streamlined our organizational structure. we are pursuing other initiatives to reduce costs and increase effectiveness, such as adopting zero-based budgeting over time.
as part of these initiatives, we commenced a voluntary employee separation program available to certain u.s.-based salaried employees nearing retirement who met age, length-of-service and business unit/function criteria. a total of 471 employees elected the program. the electing employees remained with us through at least july 31, 2015, with some remaining beyond july 31. we also implemented an initiative to reduce overhead across the organization by eliminating approximately 250 positions. in 2016, we recorded a restructuring charge of $35 million related to these initiatives. in 2015, we recorded a restructuring charge of $102 million related to these initiatives.
22
in 2016, we also incurred charges of $47 million recorded in administrative expenses related to the implementation of the new organizational structure and cost savings initiatives. in 2015, we incurred charges of $22 million recorded in administrative expenses related to these initiatives.
the aggregate after-tax impact of restructuring charges, implementation costs and other related costs recorded in 2016 was $52 million, or $0.17 per share. the aggregate after-tax impact of restructuring charges and implementation and other costs recorded in 2015 was $78 million, or $.25 per share. a summary of the pre-tax costs associated with the 2015 initiatives is as follows:
(millions)                                             recognized as of july 31, 2016
severance pay and benefits                            $128
implementation costs and other related costs            78
total                                                 $206
the total estimated pre-tax costs for the 2015 initiatives are approximately $250 million to $300 million. we expect the costs to consist of approximately $135 million to $145 million in severance pay and benefits, and approximately $115 million to $155 million in implementation costs and other related costs.we expect the total pre-tax costs related to the 2015 initiatives will be associated with segments as follows: americas simple meals and beverages - approximately 30%; global biscuits and snacks - approximately 32%; campbell fresh - approximately 3%; and corporate - approximately 35%.
we expect substantially all costs to be cash expenditures, except for $7 million of non-cash postretirement and pension curtailment costs incurred in 2015. we expect to incur the costs through 2018, and to fund the costs through cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings.
we expect the 2015 initiatives to generate pre-tax savings of approximately $265 million in 2017, and once fully implemented, annual ongoing savings of approximately $300 million beginning in 2018. in 2016 and 2015, pre-tax savings were $215 million and $85 million, respectively.

2014 initiatives in 2014, we implemented initiatives to reduce overhead across the organization, restructure manufacturing and streamline operations for our soup and broth business in china and improve supply chain efficiency in australia. details of the 2014 initiatives include:
•   we streamlined our salaried workforce in north america and our workforce in the asia pacific region. approximately 250 positions were eliminated.
•   together with our joint venture partner swire pacific limited, we restructured manufacturing and streamlined operations for our soup and broth business in china. as a result, certain assets were impaired, and approximately 100 positions were eliminated.
•   in australia, we commenced an initiative to improve supply chain efficiency by relocating production from our biscuit plant in marleston to huntingwood. the relocation will continue through 2017 and will result in the elimination of approximately 45 positions.
•   we implemented an initiative to reduce overhead across the organization by eliminating approximately 85 positions. the actions were completed in 2015.
in 2016, we recorded a reduction to restructuring charges of $4 million ($3 million after tax, or $.01 per share) related to the 2014 initiatives. in 2014, we recorded a restructuring charge of $54 million ($33 million after tax, or $.10 per share, in earnings

liquidity and capital resources we expect foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through anticipated cash flows from operations; long-term borrowings; short-term borrowings, including commercial paper; credit facilities; and cash and cash equivalents. we believe that our sources of financing will be adequate to meet our future requirements.
we generated cash flows from operations of $1.463 billion in 2016, compared to $1.182 billion in 2015. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to higher cash earnings and lower working capital requirements, primarily inventories.
we generated cash flows from operations of $1.182 billion in 2015, compared to $899 million in 2014. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to lower working capital requirements, taxes paid in 2014 on the divestiture of the european simple meals business and lower pension contributions in 2015, partially offset by lower cash earnings.
current assets are less than current liabilities as a result of our level of current maturities of long-term debt and short-term borrowings and our focus to lower core working capital requirements by reducing trade receivables and inventories while extending payment terms for accounts payables. we had negative working capital of $647 million as of july 31, 2016, and $713 million as of august 2, 2015. debt maturing within one year was $1.219 billion as of july 31, 2016, and $1.543 billion as of august 2, 2015.
capital expenditures were $341 million in 2016, $380 million in 2015 and $347 million in 2014. capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $350 million in 2017. capital expenditures in 2016 included projects to expand: beverage and salad dressing capacity at bolthouse farms (approximately $22 million); biscuit capacity in indonesia (approximately $11 million); warehouse capacity in north america (approximately $11 million); cracker capacity at pepperidge farm (approximately $9 million); and capacity in malaysia (approximately $6 million); as well as the continued enhancement of our corporate headquarters (approximately $15 million) and the ongoing initiative to simplify the soup-making process in north america (also known as the soup common platform initiative) (approximately $5 million). capital expenditures in 2015 included projects to expand: cracker capacity at pepperidge farm (approximately $36 million); beverage and salad dressing capacity at bolthouse farms (approximately $33 million); warehouse capacity at bolthouse farms (approximately $13 million); biscuit capacity in indonesia (approximately $13 million); and aseptic broth capacity (approximately $6 million); as well as the ongoing soup common platform initiative in north america (approximately $30 million); and continued enhancement of our corporate headquarters (approximately $12 million). capital expenditures in 2014 included projects to expand: capacity at pepperidge farm (approximately $48 million) and broth capacity (approximately $15 million); as well as the ongoing soup common platform initiative in north america (approximately $22 million); continued enhancement of our corporate headquarters (approximately $12 million); a flexible beverage production line for bolthouse farms (approximately $11 million); the refurbishment of a beverage filling and packaging line for the americas simple meals and beverages business (approximately $10 million); the packing automation and capacity expansion projects at one of our australian biscuit plants (approximately $10 million) and an advanced planning system in north america (approximately $4 million).
on june 29, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the assets of garden fresh gourmet. the purchase price was $232 million, and was funded through the issuance of commercial paper.
on august 8, 2013, we completed the acquisition of kelsen. the final all-cash purchase price was $331 million and was funded through the issuance of commercial paper.
in march 2015, we issued $300 million of 3.30% notes that mature on march 19, 2025. interest on the notes is due semi-annually on march 19 and september 19, commencing on september 19, 2015. the notes may be redeemed in whole, or in part, at our option at any time at the applicable redemption price. in certain circumstances, we may be required to repurchase some or all of the notes upon a change in control of our company and a downgrade of the notes below investment grade. the net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.
dividend payments were $390 million in 2016, $394 million in 2015 and $391 million in 2014. annual dividends declared were $1.248 per share in 2016, 2015, and 2014. the 2016 fourth quarter dividend was $.312 per share. on september 1, 2016,
25
we announced that our board of directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend from $.312 per share to $.35 per share. the quarterly dividend is payable on october 31, 2016.
we repurchased approximately 3 million shares at a cost of $143 million in 2016, approximately 5 million shares at a cost of $244 million in 2015, and approximately 2 million shares at a cost of $76 million in 2014. see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements and "market for registrant's capital stock, related shareholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" for more information.
at july 31, 2016, we had $1.219 billion of short-term borrowings due within one year, of which $770 million was comprised of commercial paper borrowings. as of july 31, 2016, we issued $47 million of standby letters of credit. we have a committed revolving credit facility totaling $2.2 billion that matures in december 2018. this u.s. facility remained unused at july 31, 2016, except for $3 million of standby letters of credit that we issued under it. the u.s. facility supports our commercial paper programs and other general corporate purposes. we may increase the commitment under the u.s. facility up to an additional $500 million, upon the agreement of either existing lenders or of additional banks not currently parties to the facility. in july 2016, we entered into a committed revolving credit facility totaling cad $280 million, or $215 million, that matures in july 2019. the canadian facility's commitment mandatorily reduces to cad $225 million in july 2017 and to cad $185 million in july 2018. the canadian facility supports general corporate purposes. as of july 31, 2016, we borrowed cad $280 million, or $215 million, at a rate of 1.78% pursuant to this facility, of which cad $55 million, or $42 million, is classified as short-term borrowings. in august 2016, we reduced the borrowings and commitment under the canadian facility by cad $35 million, or $27 million.
on october 28, 2013, we completed the sale of our european simple meals business to soppa investments s.à r.l., an affiliate of cvc capital partners, for €400 million, or $548 million. the sale price was subject to certain post-closing adjustments, which resulted in a $14 million reduction of proceeds. we used the proceeds from the sale to pay taxes on the sale, to reduce debt and for other general corporate purposes.
in september 2014, we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission that registered an indeterminate amount of debt securities. under the registration statement, we may issue debt securities from time to time, depending on market conditions.
we are in compliance with the covenants contained in our revolving credit facilities and debt securities.
contractual obligations and other commitments contractual obligations the following table summarizes our obligations and commitments to make future payments under certain contractual obligations as of july 31, 2016. for additional information on debt, see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. operating leases are primarily entered into for warehouse and office facilities and certain equipment. purchase commitments represent purchase orders and long-term purchase arrangements related to the procurement of ingredients, supplies, machinery, equipment and services. these commitments are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity. other long-term liabilities primarily represent payments related to deferred compensation obligations. for additional information on other long-term liabilities, see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.

off-balance sheet arrangements and other commitments we guarantee approximately 2,000 bank loans to pepperidge farm independent contractor distributors by third-party financial institutions used to purchase distribution routes. the maximum potential amount of the future payments under existing guarantees we could be required to make is $198 million. our guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes. we do not believe that it is probable that we will be required to make material guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed. see also note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for information on off-balance sheet arrangements.
inflation we are exposed to the impact of inflation on our cost of products sold. we use a number of strategies to mitigate the effects of cost inflation including increasing prices, commodity hedging and pursuing cost productivity initiatives such as global procurement strategies and capital investments that improve the efficiency of operations.
market risk sensitivity the principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. in addition, we are exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. we manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain our variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. international operations, which accounted for 19% of 2016 net sales, are concentrated principally in australia and canada. we manage our foreign currency exposures by borrowing in various foreign currencies and utilizing cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts. we enter into cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts for periods consistent with related underlying exposures, and the contracts do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments.
we principally use a combination of purchase orders and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. we also enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of wheat, diesel fuel, aluminum, soybean oil, cocoa, natural gas, butter, corn and cheese, which impact the cost of raw materials.
the information below summarizes our market risks associated with debt obligations and other significant financial instruments as of july 31, 2016. fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes 13, 14 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements.

as of august 2, 2015, fixed-rate debt of approximately $2.57 billion with an average interest rate of 3.95% and variable-rate debt of approximately $1.53 billion with an average interest rate of 0.58% were outstanding. as of august 2, 2015, $300 million forward starting interest rate swaps were outstanding. the average rate to be received on these swaps was 2.75%, and the average rate to be paid was estimated to be 3.09% over the remaining life of the swaps.
we are exposed to foreign exchange risk related to our international operations, including non-functional currency intercompany debt and net investments in subsidiaries.
cross-currency swaps we did not have any cross-currency swap contracts outstanding as of july 31, 2016. the cross-currency swap contracts outstanding as of august 2, 2015, represented one pay variable aud/receive variable usd swap with a notional value totaling $31 million and four pay variable cad/receive variable usd swaps with notional values totaling $219 million. the aggregate notional value of these swap contracts was $250 million as of august 2, 2015, and the aggregate fair value of these swap contracts was a gain of $40 million as of august 2, 2015.
we are also exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries, including subsidiary debt. we utilize foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge these exposures. the following table summarizes the foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding and the related weighted-average contract exchange rates as of july 31, 2016.

we had an additional number of smaller contracts to purchase or sell various other currencies with a notional value of $10 million as of july 31, 2016. the aggregate fair value of all contracts was a loss of $10 million as of july 31, 2016. the total notional value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding was $283 million, and the aggregate fair value was a gain of $10 million as of august 2, 2015.
we enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities. the notional value of these contracts was $88 million, and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of $1 million as of july 31, 2016. the notional value of these contracts was $95 million, and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of $9 million as of august 2, 2015.
we enter into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of our capital stock, the total return of the vanguard institutional index, and the total return of the vanguard total international stock index. under these contracts, we pay variable interest rates and receive from the counterparty either the total return on our capital stock; the total return of the standard & poor's 500 index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the vanguard institutional index; or the total return of the ishares msci eafe index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the vanguard total international stock index. the notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return on our capital stock was $15 million at july 31, 2016, and $17 million at august 2, 2015. the average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in april 2017, was 1.13% at july 31, 2016. the notional value of the contract that is linked to the return on the standard & poor's 500 index was $22 million at july 31, 2016, and $24 million at august 2, 2015. the average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in march 2017, was 0.90% at july 31, 2016. the notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return of the ishares msci eafe index was $7 million at july 31, 2016, and $8 million at august 2, 2015. the average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in march 2017, was 0.90% at july 31, 2016. the fair value of these contracts was not material at july 31, 2016, and august 2, 2015.
our utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year. changes in the portfolio of financial instruments are a function of the results of operations, debt repayment and debt issuances, market effects on debt and foreign currency, and our acquisition and divestiture activities.

significant accounting estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. the following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions:
trade and consumer promotion programs - we offer various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as feature price discounts, in-store display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees, and coupons. the mix between promotion programs, which are classified as reductions in revenue, and advertising or other marketing activities, which are classified as marketing and selling expenses, fluctuates between periods based on our overall marketing plans, and such fluctuations have an impact on revenues. the measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. typically, programs that are offered have a very short duration. historically, the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements. however, actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates.
valuation of long-lived assets - fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if impairment exists. if impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value.
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. a reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a two-step quantitative test. the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. we may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. the discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions. if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the "implied" fair value, which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination.
indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average cost of capital, and assumed royalty rates. if the fair value is less than the carrying value, the asset is reduced to fair value.
in the fourth quarter of 2016, as part of our annual review of goodwill and intangible assets, we recognized an impairment charge of $106 million on goodwill and $35 million on a trademark within the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit, which is part of the campbell fresh segment. in 2016, carrot performance primarily reflected the adverse impact of weather conditions on crop yields, and execution issues in response to those conditions, which led to customer dissatisfaction, a loss of business, and higher carrot costs in the second half of the year. these factors resulted in a decline in profitability during the second half of the year which was below our expectations. although we expect sales and margins to improve over time, after this weak performance we revised our 2017 outlook and long-term expectations in the fourth quarter. the impairment was attributable to this revised future outlook for the business, with reduced expectations for sales, margins, and discounted cash flows.
in the fourth quarter of 2015, as part of our annual review of intangible assets, we recognized an impairment charge of $6 million on minor trademarks used in the global biscuits and snacks segment. the trademarks were determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brands, resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows.
the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, economic conditions, market conditions, and cost of capital. inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control, such as capital markets. the actual cash flows could differ materially from management's estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, and economic conditions.
as of july 31, 2016, the carrying value of goodwill was $2.263 billion, of which $202 million relates to the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit. the carrying value of the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit represents fair value as a result of the impairment charge in 2016. in addition, we acquired garden fresh gourmet on june 29, 2015, and therefore the fair value is not significantly in excess of the carrying value. as of july 31, 2016, goodwill related to
29
garden fresh gourmet was $116 million. as of the 2016 measurement, excluding the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit and garden fresh gourmet, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by at least 25%. holding all other assumptions used in the 2016 fair value measurement constant, a 100-basis-point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in the carrying value of any reporting unit, other than the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit and garden fresh gourmet, to be in excess of the fair value. the fair value was based on significant management assumptions. if assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline, potential impairment charges could result.
as of july 31, 2016, the carrying value of indefinite-lived trademarks was $927 million, of which $68 million relates to the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit. holding all other assumptions used in the 2016 measurement constant, a 100-basis-point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would reduce the fair value of trademarks, and result in an impairment charge of approximately $30 million.

pension and postretirement benefits - we provide certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees. determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, perform the required calculations to determine expense.
the discount rate is established as of our fiscal year-end measurement date. in establishing the discount rate, we review published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. in addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. the expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering our current and projected investment mix. this estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long-term projected real returns for each asset class, and a premium for active management. within any given fiscal period, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets. gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date.
net periodic pension and postretirement expense was $317 million in 2016, $125 million in 2015 and $58 million in 2014.
significant weighted-average assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows:
2016                                            2015         2014
pension discount rate for benefit obligations   3.39%        4.19%        4.33%
expected return on plan assets          7.09%        7.35%        7.62%
postretirement discount rate for obligations           3.20%        4.00%        4.00%
initial health care trend rate          7.25%        7.75%        8.25%
ultimate health care trend rate         4.50%        4.50%        4.50%
estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows: a 50-basis-point decline in the discount rate would decrease expense by approximately $6 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of approximately $180 million. a 50-basis-point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately $10 million. a one-percentage-point increase in assumed health care costs would have no impact on postretirement service and interest cost and would result in an immediate loss recognition of $12 million.
no contributions were made to u.s. pension plans in 2016 and 2015. we contributed $35 million to u.s. pension plans in 2014. contributions to non-u.s. plans were $2 million in 2016, $5 million in 2015 and $12 million in 2014. we do not expect to contribute to the u.s. pension plans in 2017. contributions to non-u.s. plans are expected to be approximately $5 million in 2017.

income taxes - the effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and management's estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.

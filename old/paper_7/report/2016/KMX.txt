overview see part i, item 1 for a detailed description and discussion of the company's business.
carmax is the nation's largest retailer of used vehicles.  we operate in two reportable segments:  carmax sales operations and carmax auto finance ("caf").  our carmax sales operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations, excluding financing provided by caf.  our caf segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides financing to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax.
carmax sales operations our sales operations segment consists of retail sales of used vehicles and related products and services, such as wholesale vehicle sales; the sale of extended protection plan ("epp") products, which include extended service plans ("esps") and guaranteed asset protection ("gap"); and vehicle repair service. we offer low, no-haggle prices; a broad selection of carmax quality certified used vehicles; value-added epp products; and superior customer service. our website and related mobile apps are tools for communicating the carmax consumer offer in detail, sophisticated search engines for finding the right vehicle and sales channels for customers who prefer to conduct part of the shopping and sales process online.
our customers finance the majority of the retail vehicles purchased from us, and availability of on-the-spot financing is a critical component of the sales process.  we provide financing to qualified retail customers through caf and our arrangements with industry-leading third-party finance providers.  all of the finance offers, whether by caf or our third-party providers, are backed by a 3-day payoff option.
as of february 28, 2017, we operated 173 used car stores in 86 u.s. television markets. as of that date, we also conducted wholesale auctions at 72 used car stores and we operated 2 new car franchises.
carmax auto finance in addition to third-party finance providers, we provide vehicle financing through caf, which offers financing solely to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax.  caf allows us to manage our reliance on third-party finance providers and to leverage knowledge of our business to provide qualifying customers a competitive financing option.  as a result, we believe caf enables us to capture additional profits, cash flows and sales.  caf income primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables, a provision for estimated loan losses and direct expenses. caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs. after the effect of 3-day payoffs and vehicle returns, caf financed 44.2% of our retail used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2017.  as of february 28, 2017, caf serviced approximately 808,000 customer accounts in its $10.68 billion portfolio of managed receivables.
management regularly analyzes caf's operating results by assessing the competitiveness of our consumer offer, profitability, the performance of the auto loan receivables, including trends in credit losses and delinquencies, and caf direct expenses.
revenues and profitability during fiscal 2017, net sales and operating revenues increased 4.8% and net earnings increased 0.6%. the 7.6% increase in earnings per share reflected the increase in net earnings and the effect of our ongoing share repurchase program.
our primary source of revenue and net income is the retail sale of used vehicles. during fiscal 2017, we sold 671,294 used cars, representing 83.6% of our net sales and operating revenues and 66.5% of our gross profit.  used vehicle revenues grew 6.7% and used vehicle gross profits improved 8.4%, primarily due to an 8.3% increase in total used unit sales, which included a 4.3% increase in comparable store used units.
wholesale sales are also a significant contributor to our revenues and net income. during fiscal 2017, we sold 391,686 wholesale vehicles, representing 13.1% of our net sales and operating revenues and 16.6% of our gross profit.  wholesale vehicle revenues
22
decreased 4.8% and wholesale vehicle gross profits decreased 6.6% due to the combination of a 0.7% decrease in unit sales and a 5.9% decrease in wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit.
during fiscal 2017, other sales and revenues, which include revenue earned on the sale of epp products, net third-party finance fees, and service department and new car sales, represented 3.3% of our net sales and operating revenues and 16.9% of our gross profit.  other sales and revenues remained consistent with fiscal 2016, despite the disposal of two of our four new car franchises in fiscal 2016, and other gross profit rose 26.3%, primarily reflecting improvements in epp revenues and net third-party finance fees.
income from our caf segment totaled $369.0 million in fiscal 2017, down 5.9% compared with fiscal 2016.  the decline in caf income was primarily due to an increase in the provision for loan losses and a lower total interest margin percentage.
during fiscal 2017, selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expenses increased 10.1% to $1.49 billion, primarily reflecting the 9% increase in our store base since the beginning of fiscal 2017, as well as an increase in share-based compensation and spending related to strategic initiatives.
liquidity our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations, proceeds from securitization transactions, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility or through other financing sources.  during fiscal 2017, net cash used in operations totaled $468.1 million. this amount, combined with $1.21 billion of net issuances of non-recourse notes payable, resulted in $746.6 million of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities, a non-gaap measure. this liquidity, together with a $240.0 million increase in long-term debt, was primarily used to fund the 10.3 million common shares repurchased under our share repurchase program, our store growth and the increase in caf auto loan receivables.
when considering cash provided by operating activities, management does not include increases in auto loan receivables that have been funded with non-recourse notes payable, which are separately reflected as cash provided by financing activities. for a reconciliation of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities to net cash used in operating activities, the most directly comparable gaap financial measure, see "reconciliation of adjusted net cash from operating activities" included in "financial condition - liquidity and capital resources."
future outlook over the long term, we believe the primary driver for earnings growth will be vehicle unit sales growth from both new stores and stores included in our comparable store base.  we also believe that increased used vehicle unit sales will drive increased sales of wholesale vehicles and ancillary products and, over time, increased caf income.  to expand our vehicle unit sales at new and existing stores, we will need to continue delivering an unrivaled customer experience in stores and online, which will require investments in our information technology infrastructure and other strategic initiatives. we also will need to continue hiring and developing the associates necessary to drive our success, while managing the risks posed by an evolving competitive environment.  in addition, to support our store growth plans, we will need to continue procuring suitable real estate at favorable terms. while in any individual period conditions may vary, over the long term we would expect to begin leveraging our sg&a expenses when comparable store used unit sales growth is in the mid-single digit range.
we are continuing the national rollout of our retail concept, and as of february 28, 2017, we had used car stores located in 86 u.s. television markets which covered approximately 70% of the u.s. population.  during fiscal 2017, we opened 15 stores.  in fiscal 2018, we plan to open 15 stores. in fiscal 2019, we plan to open between 13 and 16 stores. for a detailed list of stores we plan to open in fiscal 2018, see the table included in "planned future activities."
a significant portion of our used vehicle inventory is sourced from local, regional and online wholesale auto auctions. wholesale vehicle prices are influenced by a variety of factors, including the supply of vehicles available at auction relative to dealer demand. industry sources predict that there will be a continued influx in off-lease vehicles in coming years, which has and could continue to increase the volume of late-model vehicles available at auction relative to dealer demand. this has and could continue to reduce wholesale auction prices and our vehicle acquisition costs. it could also impact caf recovery rates.
for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our company, see "risk factors," included in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k.
23
critical accounting policies our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.  preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  we use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions.  we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions.  note 2 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies.  the accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment.  our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed.
financing and securitization transactions we maintain a revolving funding program composed of three warehouse facilities ("warehouse facilities") that we use to fund auto loan receivables originated by caf. we typically elect to fund these receivables through a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement at a later date.  we recognize transfers of auto loan receivables into the warehouse facilities and term securitizations ("funding vehicles") as secured borrowings, which result in recording the auto loan receivables and the related non-recourse notes payable on our consolidated balance sheets.  caf income included in the consolidated statements of earnings primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables, a provision for estimated loan losses and direct caf expenses.
auto loan receivables include amounts due from customers related to retail vehicle sales financed through caf.  the receivables are presented net of an allowance for estimated loan losses.  the allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in our portfolio of managed receivables as of the applicable reporting date and anticipated to occur during the following 12 months.  the allowance is primarily based on the credit quality of the underlying receivables, historical loss trends and forecasted forward loss curves.  we also take into account recent trends in delinquencies and defaults, recovery rates and the economic environment.  the provision for loan losses is the periodic expense of maintaining an adequate allowance.
see notes 2(f), 2(h) and 4 for additional information on securitizations and auto loan receivables.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete, generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer. as part of our customer service strategy, we guarantee the retail vehicles we sell with a 5‐day, money-back guarantee.  we record a reserve for estimated returns based on historical experience and trends, and results could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from historical averages.
we also sell esps and gap on behalf of unrelated third parties, who are the primary obligors, to customers who purchase a retail vehicle. the esps we currently offer on all used vehicles provide coverage up to 60 months (subject to mileage limitations), while gap covers the customer for the term of their finance contract.  we recognize revenue, on a net basis, at the time of sale. we also record a reserve for estimated contract cancellations.  periodically, we may receive additional revenue based upon the level of underwriting profits of the third parties who administer the products.  these additional amounts are recognized as revenue when received.  the reserve for cancellations is evaluated for each product and is based on forecasted forward cancellation curves utilizing historical experience, recent trends and credit mix of the customer base.  our risk related to contract cancellations is limited to the revenue that we receive.  cancellations fluctuate depending on the volume of epp sales, customer financing default or prepayment rates, and shifts in customer behavior related to changes in the coverage or term of the product.  results could be affected if actual events differ from our estimates. a 10% change in the estimated cancellation rates would have changed cancellation reserves by approximately $10.8 million as of february 28, 2017.  see note 8 for additional information on cancellation reserves.
customers applying for financing who are not approved or are conditionally approved by caf are generally evaluated by other third-party finance providers.  these providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed, pre-negotiated fee per contract.  we recognize these fees at the time of sale.
we collect sales taxes and other taxes from customers on behalf of governmental authorities at the time of sale.  these taxes are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in net sales and operating revenues or cost of sales.
income taxes estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets.  in the ordinary course of business, transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain at the time of the transactions.  we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that our actual results will differ from our estimates.  tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted.  see note 9 for additional information on income taxes.
24
we evaluate the need to record valuation allowances that would reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.  when assessing the need for valuation allowances, we consider available loss carrybacks, tax planning strategies, future reversals of existing temporary differences and future taxable income.  except for a valuation allowance recorded for capital loss carryforwards that may not be utilized before their expiration, we believe that our recorded deferred tax assets as of february 28, 2017, will more likely than not be realized.  however, if a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would be affected in the period when the change in circumstances occurs.
in addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations.  we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the u.s. federal and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.  if payments of these amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.  if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result in the period of determination.

during fiscal 2017, we opened 15 stores, including 10 stores in 8 new television markets (3 stores in san francisco, ca, and 1 store each in albany, ny; boise, id; bristol, tn; el paso, tx; grand rapids, mi; mobile, al and springfield, il) and 5 stores in 4 existing television markets (2 stores in los angeles, ca and 1 store each in boston, ma; daytona, fl and philadelphia, pa).
used vehicle sales fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2016. the 6.7% increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2017 resulted from an 8.3% increase in unit sales combined with a 1.7% decline in average retail selling price. the increase in used unit sales included a 4.3% increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base. the comparable store used unit sales performance resulted from an increase in conversion, partially offset by a slight decline in store traffic. we believe that improved execution in our stores, as well as our recent website redesign and enhanced online capabilities, which have made it easier for our customers to submit leads, have contributed to our continued improvements in conversion.
we believe the decline in store traffic was predominantly the result of a decline in customers typically financed by tier 3 providers. the decline in tier 3 sales was the result of tightened lending standards by one of our third-party tier 3 finance providers that we experienced starting in the middle of the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and lower applicant volume within this credit tier. during fiscal 2017, we experienced an overall improvement in the credit quality of our credit applicant mix, which contributed to the lower penetration rates for both tier 2 and tier 3 providers and higher penetration rates for caf and customers arranging their own financing. based on our analysis of industry data, we believe the shift in credit applicant mix was not unique to carmax. historically, the tier 3 rate of conversion of credit applications to sales has been significantly lower than that in other credit tiers. as a result, we believe a decline in tier 3 sales mix typically represents a disproportionate decline in underlying customer traffic. for the non-tier 3 customer base, comparable store used unit sales rose 9.1% in fiscal 2017. our data indicates that in our television markets, we increased our share of the 0- to 10-year old used vehicle market by approximately 2% in calendar 2016.
26
the decline in average retail selling price reflected the net effects of lower vehicle acquisition costs and shifts in the mix of our sales by both vehicle age and class. generally, we pass on decreases in our vehicle acquisition costs to consumers in the form of lower selling prices. we believe the increased supply of late-model vehicles available at auction is contributing to the lower acquisition costs, which, in turn, is helping to increase the value proposition of late-model used vehicles relative to new cars.
fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015. the 6.6% increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2016 resulted from a 6.5% increase in used unit sales.  the increase in used unit sales included a 2.4% increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base.  the comparable store used unit sales performance was driven by improved conversion, partially offset by a decrease in store traffic. we believe that various market factors, including, but not limited to, the availability and relative valuations of certain used vehicle inventories, and new vehicle lease and price promotions, may have contributed to the decrease in store traffic. our data indicates that in our television markets, we increased our share of the 0- to 10-year old used vehicle market by approximately 1% in calendar 2015.
wholesale vehicle sales vehicles sold at our wholesale auctions are, on average, approximately 10 years old with more than 100,000 miles and are primarily comprised of vehicles purchased through our appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards. our wholesale auction prices usually reflect the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell, although they can also be affected by changes in vehicle mix or the average age, mileage or condition of the vehicles being sold.
fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2016. the 4.8% decrease in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2017 resulted from a 4.1% decrease in wholesale vehicle average selling prices and a 0.7% decrease in wholesale unit sales. during fiscal 2017, increases in wholesale unit volumes attributable to the growth in our store base and an improved appraisal buy rate were more than offset by a reduction in appraisal traffic. in particular, we experienced a reduced mix of 7- to 9-year old vehicles in our wholesale sales mix, which we believe resulted, at least in part, from the reduced overall industry supply of these model year vehicles due to the decline in industry new vehicle sales during the recession. this shift in mix also contributed to the decline in average selling price.
fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015. the 6.8% increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2016 resulted from a 4.9% increase in wholesale unit sales and a 1.0% increase in average wholesale vehicle selling price.  the wholesale unit growth primarily reflected the growth in our store base.
other sales and revenues other sales and revenues include revenue from the sale of esps and gap (collectively reported in epp revenues, net of a reserve for estimated contract cancellations), net third-party finance fees, and other revenues, which are predominately comprised of service department and new vehicle sales. the fees we pay to the tier 3 providers are reflected as an offset to finance fee revenues received from the tier 2 providers. the mix of our retail vehicles financed by caf, tier 2 and tier 3 providers, or customers that arrange their own financing, may vary from quarter to quarter depending on several factors including the credit quality of applicants, changes in providers' credit decisioning and external market conditions. changes in originations by one tier of credit providers may also affect the originations made by providers in other tiers.
fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2016. other sales and revenues remained consistent in fiscal 2017, as changes in the underlying components offset one another. new vehicle sales declined due to the disposal of two of our four new car franchises during fiscal 2016. epp revenues increased 14.1% largely reflecting the growth in our used unit sales and pricing changes. net third-party finance fees improved by 37.6% primarily due to the reduced proportion of our used unit sales financed by tier 3 finance providers.
fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015. other sales and revenues decreased 4.2% in fiscal 2016, primarily due to our disposal of two of the four new car franchises we owned at the start of fiscal 2016. epp revenues increased 4.7% largely reflecting the growth in our used unit sales. net third-party finance fees improved by 3.5% primarily due to shifts in the mix among finance providers.

used vehicle gross profit we target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold.  the gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors, including its probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age; however, it is not primarily based on the vehicle's selling price.  our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market trade-in trends and the pace of our inventory turns reduce our exposure to the inherent continual fluctuation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit.
we systematically mark down individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales trends, inventory turns and gross profit achievement.  other factors that may influence gross profit include changes in our vehicle reconditioning costs, changes in the percentage of vehicles sourced directly from consumers through our appraisal process and changes in the wholesale pricing environment. vehicles purchased directly from consumers typically generate more gross profit per unit compared with vehicles purchased at auction or through other channels.
fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2016. the 8.4% increase in used vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by the 8.3% growth in total used unit sales. despite an overall trend reported by publicly traded auto retailers in recent quarters towards lower gross profit per unit sold, our used vehicle gross profit per unit remained consistent with fiscal 2016. we believe we can manage to a targeted gross profit per unit dollar range, subject to future changes to our business or pricing strategy.
fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015. the 5.5% increase in used vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by the 6.5% growth in total used unit sales, partially offset by a modest decline in used gross profit per unit.
wholesale vehicle gross profit our wholesale gross profit per unit reflects the demand for older, higher mileage vehicles, which are the mainstay of our auctions, as well as strong dealer attendance and resulting high dealer-to-car ratios at our auctions.  the frequency of our auctions, which are generally held weekly or bi-weekly, minimizes the depreciation risk on these vehicles.  our ability to adjust appraisal offers in response to the wholesale pricing environment is a key factor that influences wholesale gross profit.
fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2016. the 6.6% decrease in wholesale vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2017 reflected the combination of the 0.7% decrease in wholesale unit sales and a $58, or 5.9%, reduction in wholesale gross profit per unit. the decline in gross profit per unit was due in part to the reduced proportion of 7- to 9-year old vehicles in our wholesale sales mix. in addition, compared with fiscal 2016, differences in the rate of depreciation relative to changes in our appraisal offers contributed to the decline in wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit.
fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015. the 6.4% increase in wholesale vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2016 reflected the combination of the 4.9% increase in wholesale unit sales with a $14 increase in wholesale gross profit per unit.
other gross profit other gross profit includes profits related to epp revenues, net third-party finance fees and other revenues, which are predominantly comprised of service department operations, including used vehicle reconditioning, and new vehicle sales.  we have no cost of sales related to epp revenues or net third-party finance fees, as these represent revenues paid to us by certain third-party providers. third-party finance fees are reported net of the fees we pay to third-party tier 3 finance providers.  accordingly, changes in the relative mix of the components of other gross profit can affect the composition and amount of other gross profit.
28
fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2016. other gross profit rose 26.3% in fiscal 2017, primarily reflecting the improvement in epp revenues and net third-party finance fees discussed above. the decrease in new vehicle sales did not significantly affect other gross profit.
fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015. other gross profit increased 14.9% in fiscal 2016, primarily reflecting the improvement in epp revenues and net third-party finance fees discussed above, as well as an increase in service department gross profits due to a change in the timing of our recognition of reconditioning overhead costs, which increased other gross profit in fiscal 2016 by $10.4 million. these costs, which previously had been expensed as incurred, are now allocated to the carrying cost of inventory.
impact of inflation historically, inflation has not had a significant impact on results.  profitability is primarily affected by our ability to achieve targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than by changes in average retail prices.  however, changes in average vehicle selling prices impact caf income, to the extent the average amount financed also changes.

(3)   calculated as total sg&amp;a expenses divided by total used vehicle units.
fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2016. sg&a expenses for fiscal 2017 increased 10.1%. the increase primarily reflected the 9% growth in our store base during fiscal 2017 (representing the addition of 15 stores), and a $35.7 million increase in share-based compensation expense. the increase in share-based compensation expense increased sg&a per used unit by $47 and was largely related to cash-settled restricted stock units, which are awards provided broadly to non-executive associates in our organization. the expense associated with these units was influenced by the change in the company's stock price during the fiscal year. the fiscal 2017 share-based compensation expense included approximately $10 million of incremental expense related to awards granted or modified by the board of directors to our recently retired chief executive officer, thomas j. folliard. mr. folliard was effectively provided retirement treatment under the terms of the awards, notwithstanding that he was younger than 55 years old. however, the vesting of the awards was not accelerated on his retirement and no changes were made to the full-term expiration dates or the strike prices of the awards. the $41.5 million, or 20.9%, increase in other overhead costs included increased spending related to strategic initiatives.
fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015. sg&a expenses for fiscal 2015 were reduced by $20.9 million, or $0.06 per share, which represented our receipt of settlement proceeds in a class action lawsuit related to the economic loss associated with certain toyota vehicles.  excluding this litigation settlement, the fiscal 2016 increase reflected the 10% growth in our store base (representing the addition of 14 stores) and higher information technology and marketing costs. this was partially offset by a $23.3 million decrease in share-based compensation expense, which was influenced by decreases in the per share price of our common stock during fiscal 2016. the decrease in share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2016 reduced sg&a per used unit by $38.
interest expense interest expense includes the interest related to short- and long-term debt and finance and capital lease obligations. it does not include interest on the non-recourse notes payable, which is reflected within caf income.
29
fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2016. interest expense increased to $56.4 million in fiscal 2017 versus $36.4 million in fiscal 2016. the increase reflected the combination of planned higher outstanding debt levels in fiscal 2017 as part of our capital structure strategy, as well as growth in our finance and capital lease obligations. see "financial condition - liquidity and capital resources" for further discussion. during fiscal 2017, we sold $500 million of senior unsecured notes, due in 2023, 2026 and 2028, to investors in a private placement.
fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015. interest expense increased to $36.4 million in fiscal 2016 versus $24.5 million in fiscal 2015, primarily reflecting our higher average outstanding borrowings.  during fiscal 2016, as a result of borrowings to fund our stock repurchase activity, we moved closer to our target range for adjusted debt to capital ratio.
other expense during fiscal 2016, we recorded a one-time charge of $8.3 million associated with a property that is no longer planned to be used.
income taxes the effective income tax rate was 37.7% in fiscal 2017, 38.3% in fiscal 2016 and 38.4% in fiscal 2015.
results of operations - carmax auto finance caf income primarily reflects interest and fee income generated by caf's portfolio of auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables, a provision for estimated loan losses and direct caf expenses. caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs.  although caf benefits from certain indirect overhead expenditures, we have not allocated indirect costs to caf to avoid making subjective allocation decisions.  examples of indirect costs not allocated to caf include retail store expenses and corporate expenses.
caf's managed portfolio is composed primarily of loans originated over the past several years.  trends in receivable growth and interest margins primarily reflect the cumulative effect of changes in the business over a multi-year period. we strive to originate loans with an underlying risk profile that we believe will, in the aggregate and excluding caf's tier 3 originations, result in cumulative net losses in the 2% to 2.5% range over the life of the loans.  actual loss performance of the loans may fall outside of this range based on various factors, including intentional changes in the risk profile of originations, economic conditions and wholesale recovery rates.  current period originations reflect current trends in both our retail sales and the caf business, including the volume of loans originated, current interest rates charged to consumers, loan terms and average credit scores.   because we recognize caf income over the life of the underlying auto loan, loans originated in a given fiscal period generally do not have a significant effect on that period's financial results.
see note 3 for additional information on caf income and note 4 for information on auto loan receivables, including credit quality.

(1)   the allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in our portfolio of managed receivables as of the applicable reporting date and anticipated to occur during the following 12 months.
(2)   the average recovery rate represents the average percentage of the outstanding principal balance we receive when a vehicle is repossessed and liquidated, generally at our wholesale auctions. the annual recovery rate has ranged from a low of 42% to a high of 60%, and it is primarily affected by changes in the wholesale market pricing environment.
fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2016. caf income declined 5.9% in fiscal 2017. the decline was due to an increase in the provision for loan losses and lower total interest margin percentage, partially offset by the increase in average managed receivables. average managed receivables grew 11.7% to $10.16 billion in fiscal 2017 driven by the rise in caf loan originations in recent years. the growth in net loan originations in fiscal 2017 resulted from our used vehicle sales growth and an increase in caf's penetration rate that was caused by the increased mix of credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum.
the total interest margin, which reflects the spread between interest and fees charged to consumers and our funding costs, declined to 5.8% of average managed receivables from 6.1% in fiscal 2016. this was the result of a gradual compression of the spread between rates charged to consumers and our funding costs in recent years. funding costs have increased modestly due to overall market changes while our rates charged to consumers remained stable. changes in the interest margin on new originations affect caf income over time. continued increases in interest rates, which affect caf's funding costs, or other competitive pressures on consumer rates, could result in further compression in the interest margin on new originations.
the provision for loan losses rose to $150.6 million in fiscal 2017 from $101.2 million in fiscal 2016 due to unfavorable loss experience in fiscal 2017 as well as the growth in managed receivables. while higher loss rates were primarily due to an increase in charge-offs, lower recovery rates also contributed to the unfavorable loss experience in fiscal 2017, which we believe reflects conditions impacting our industry as a whole. the increase in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of ending managed

receivables reflected the effect of the change in loss and delinquency experience on our outlook for net losses expected to occur over the next 12 months.
fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015. caf income rose 6.7% to $392.0 million in fiscal 2016, driven by the growth in average managed receivables, partially offset by a lower total interest margin percentage and an increase in the provision for loan losses. average managed receivables grew 15.7% to $9.09 billion in fiscal 2016, driven by the rise in net loan originations in recent years. net loans originated in fiscal 2016 increased 9.4%, primarily reflecting the 6.6% growth in used vehicle revenues and a higher caf penetration rate. the increase in caf's penetration rate in fiscal 2016 was largely due to changes in the underlying credit mix of customers applying for financing.
the total interest margin declined to 6.1% of average managed receivables from 6.5% in fiscal 2015.  this was the result of a gradual compression of the spread between rates charged to consumers and our funding costs in recent years.
the provision for loan losses rose 22.9% to $101.2 million in fiscal 2016, reflecting the 15.7% increase in average managed receivables in fiscal 2016 and the effect of favorable loss experience in fiscal 2015, which reduced the provision in that year. the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of ending managed receivables remained consistent at 0.99% as of february 29, 2016, versus 0.97% as of february 28, 2015.
tier 3 loan originations. caf also originates a small portion of auto loans to customers who typically would be financed by our tier 3 finance providers, in order to better understand the performance of these loans, mitigate risk and add incremental profits.  caf currently targets originating approximately 5% of the total tier 3 loan volume; however, this rate may vary over time based on market conditions. a total of $123.3 million and $96.5 million in caf tier 3 receivables were outstanding as of february 28, 2017 and february 29, 2016, respectively.  these loans have higher loss and delinquency rates than the remainder of the caf portfolio, as well as higher contract rates.  as of february 28, 2017 and february 29, 2016, approximately 10% of the total allowance for loan losses related to the outstanding caf tier 3 loan balances. during fiscal 2017, we entered into a new $100 million warehouse facility that is being used to fund a portion of caf's tier 3 loan origination activity. previously, these loans had been funded separately from the remainder of caf's portfolio using existing working capital.

planned future activities we currently plan to open 15 stores in fiscal 2018 and between 13 and 16 stores in fiscal 2019. we will be entering five new television markets and expanding our presence in seven existing television markets. of the 15 stores we plan to open in fiscal 2018, 6 are in metropolitan statistical areas ("msas") having populations of 600,000 or less, which we define as small markets. we currently estimate capital expenditures will total approximately $325 million in fiscal 2018. compared with fiscal 2017, the decrease in planned capital spending primarily reflects reduced spending on construction and land acquisitions resulting from changes in the mix of markets in which stores are being built.

financial condition liquidity and capital resources our primary ongoing cash requirements are to fund our existing operations, store expansion and improvement and caf. since fiscal 2013, we have also elected to use cash for our share repurchase program.  our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations, proceeds from securitization transactions or other funding arrangements, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility or through other financing sources.
we currently target an adjusted debt to capital ratio in a range of 35% to 45%. in calculating this ratio, we utilize total debt, excluding non-recourse notes payable, a multiple of 8 times rent expense and total shareholders' equity. we expect to use our revolving credit facility and other financing sources, together with stock repurchases, to achieve and maintain this targeted ratio; however, in any period, we may be outside this range due to seasonal, market, strategic or other factors.
operating activities. during fiscal 2017, net cash used in operating activities totaled $468.1 million compared with $148.9 million in fiscal 2016. the net cash used in operating activities includes increases in auto loan receivables of $1.21 billion in fiscal 2017 and $1.20 billion in fiscal 2016.  the majority of the increases in auto loan receivables are accompanied by increases in non-recourse notes payable, which are separately reflected as cash provided by financing activities.

as of february 28, 2017, total inventory was $2.26 billion, representing an increase of $328.5 million, or 17.0%, compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal year. the increase primarily reflected the addition of inventory to support new store openings and our comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2017. increased inventory levels were also a result of delays in federal income tax refunds that impacted the timing of anticipated sales in february. these increases were partially offset by a decline in the average carrying cost of inventory due to changes in acquisition costs.
as of february 29, 2016, total inventory was $1.93 billion, representing a decrease of $154.8 million, or 7.4%, compared with the balance as of the start of fiscal 2016.  the decrease primarily reflected the net effects of (i) a 13% decrease in used vehicles in inventory at stores included in the comparable store base in an effort to optimize inventory, (ii) the addition of inventory to support new store openings in fiscal 2016 and (iii) our disposal of two new car franchises during fiscal 2016.
when considering cash provided by operating activities, management uses an adjusted measure of net cash from operating activities that offsets the changes in auto loan receivables with the corresponding changes in non-recourse notes payable.  this is achieved by adding back the cash provided from the net issuances of non-recourse notes payable, which represents the increase in auto loan receivables that were funded through the issuance of non-recourse notes payable during the year.  the resulting financial measure, adjusted net cash from operating activities, is a non-gaap financial measure.  we believe adjusted net cash from operating activities is a meaningful metric for investors because it provides better visibility into the cash generated from operations.  including the increases in non-recourse notes payable, net cash provided by operating activities would have been as follows:

(1)   calculated using the gross issuances less payments on non-recourse notes payable as disclosed on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
adjusted net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2017 decreased compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the change in inventory during fiscal 2017, partially offset by the timing of payments related to operating payables and an increase in net income when excluding non-cash expenses, which include depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense and the provisions for loan losses and cancellation reserves. in addition, the increase in net issuances of non-recourse notes payable was primarily attributable to loan origination growth, as well as the new warehouse facility being used to fund certain of caf's tier 3 loans. in fiscal 2016, all of caf's tier 3 loans were funded through the use of existing working capital.
investing activities. net cash used in investing activities totaled $465.6 million in fiscal 2017, $378.8 million in fiscal 2016 and$360.7 million in fiscal 2015.  investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures, which totaled $418.1 million in fiscal 2017, $315.6 million in fiscal 2016 and $309.8 million in fiscal 2015. capital expenditures primarily include store construction costs, real estate acquisitions for planned future store openings and store remodeling expenses.  we maintain a multi-year pipeline of sites to support our store growth, so portions of capital spending in one year may relate to stores that we open in subsequent fiscal years.  we opened 15 stores in fiscal 2017, we opened 14 stores and relocated 1 store in fiscal 2016 and we opened 13 stores in fiscal 2015. the increase in capital expenditures in the current year period largely reflected timing changes in the purchases of land and related construction activity for future stores.
financing activities. net cash provided by financing activities totaled $934.7 million in fiscal 2017, $537.5 million in fiscal 2016 and $728.6 million in fiscal 2015.  included in these amounts were net increases in total non-recourse notes payable of $1.21 billion, $1.06 billion and $1.22 billion, respectively, which were used to provide the financing for the majority of the increases of $1.21 billion, $1.20 billion and $1.37 billion, respectively, in auto loan receivables (see operating activities).  during fiscal 2017, we sold $500 million of senior unsecured notes in a private placement, and used a portion of the proceeds to reduce net borrowings under our revolving credit facility. during fiscal 2016, we increased net borrowings under the revolving credit facility by $404.6 million. during fiscal 2015, we received proceeds of $300 million from a variable-rate term loan entered into in november 2014.  net cash provided by financing activities was reduced by stock repurchases of $564.3 million in fiscal 2017, $983.9 million in fiscal 2016 and $924.3 million in fiscal 2015.

we have a $1.20 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in august 2020.  borrowings under this credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes, and the unused portion is fully available to us.  we also have a $300 million variable-rate term loan, which is due in august 2020.  in addition, we have $500 million of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, which are due in 2023, 2026 and 2028. the credit facility, term loan and senior note agreements contain representations and warranties, conditions and covenants.  if these requirements were not met, all amounts outstanding or otherwise owed could become due and payable immediately and other limitations could be placed on our ability to use any available borrowing capacity.
finance and capital lease obligations relate primarily to stores subject to sale-leaseback transactions that did not qualify for sale accounting and, therefore, are accounted for as financings. payments on the leases are recognized as interest expense and a reduction of the obligations. in the event the leases are modified or extended beyond their original lease term, the related obligation is increased based on the present value of the revised future minimum lease payments, with a corresponding increase to the assets subject to these transactions. upon modification, the amortization of the obligation is reset, resulting in more of the lease payments being applied to interest expense in the initial years following the modification. during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, finance lease obligations were increased by $80.0 million and $103.2 million, respectively, related to leases that were modified or extended beyond their original lease term, resulting in an increase of interest expense recognized in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 that is expected to continue in fiscal 2018.
see note 11 for additional information on our revolving credit facility, term loan, senior notes and finance and capital lease obligations.
caf auto loan receivables are primarily funded through our warehouse facilities and term securitization transactions.  our funding vehicles are structured to legally isolate the auto loan receivables, and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our funding vehicles, even in insolvency, receivership or conservatorship proceedings.  similarly, the investors in the non-recourse notes payable have no recourse to our assets beyond the related receivables, the amounts on deposit in reserve accounts and the restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables.  we do, however, continue to have the rights associated with the interest we retain in these funding vehicles. loans originated in the caf tier 3 loan origination program are primarily being funded through a $100 million warehouse facility, as well as the use of existing working capital.
the timing of principal payments on the non-recourse notes payable is based on the timing of principal collections and defaults on the related auto loan receivables. the current portion of non-recourse notes payable represents principal payments that are due to be distributed in the following period.
as of february 28, 2017, $9.12 billion of non-recourse notes payable was outstanding related to term securitizations.  these notes payable have scheduled maturities through july 2023, but they may mature earlier, depending on the repayment rate of the underlying auto loan receivables. during fiscal 2017, we completed four term securitizations, funding a total of $5.03 billion of auto loan receivables.
as of february 28, 2017, $1.62 billion of non-recourse notes payable was outstanding related to our warehouse facilities.  we have periodically increased our warehouse facility limit over time, as our store base, sales and caf loan originations have grown.  in fiscal 2017, we increased the combined limit of our warehouse facilities by $300 million. as of february 28, 2017, the combined warehouse facility limit was $2.80 billion, and the unused warehouse capacity totaled $1.18 billion.  of the combined warehouse facility limit, $1.30 billion will expire in august 2017 and $1.50 billion will expire in february 2018.  see notes 2(f) and 11 for additional information on the warehouse facilities.
35
the agreements related to the warehouse facilities include various representations and warranties, covenants and performance triggers.  if these requirements are not met, we could be unable to continue to fund receivables through the warehouse facilities.  in addition, warehouse facility investors could charge us a higher rate of interest and could have us replaced as servicer.  further, we could be required to deposit collections on the related receivables with the warehouse facility agents on a daily basis and deliver executed lockbox agreements to the warehouse facility agents.
we expect that adjusted net cash provided by operations, borrowings under existing, new or expanded credit facilities and other funding arrangements will be sufficient to fund caf, capital expenditures, repurchases of stock and working capital for the foreseeable future.  we anticipate that we will be able to enter into new, or renew or expand existing, funding arrangements to meet our future funding needs.  however, based on conditions in the credit markets, the cost for these arrangements could be materially higher than historical levels and the timing and capacity of these transactions could be dictated by market availability rather than our requirements.
the timing and amount of stock repurchases are determined based on share price, market conditions, legal requirements and other factors.  shares repurchased are deemed authorized but unissued shares of common stock.  as of february 28, 2017, the board had authorized a total of $4.55 billion of repurchases.  at that date, $1.59 billion was available for repurchase under the board's outstanding authorizations, which includes an additional $750 million authorized during fiscal 2017. also during fiscal 2017, the board removed the expiration date of the outstanding repurchase authorizations.  see note 12 for more information on share repurchase activity.
fair value measurements. we recognize money market securities, mutual fund investments and derivative instruments at fair value.  see note 6 for more information on fair value measurements.

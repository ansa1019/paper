strategic acquisitions
•   in november 2016, we acquired the remaining 49% interest in our real estate joint venture with uber technologies, inc. for $90.1 million. the real estate joint venture owned land parcels located at 1455 and 1515 third street and a parking garage structure in our mission bay/soma submarket of san francisco.
•   the former real estate joint venture was expected to complete the development of two new class a properties in 2018, pursuant to leases with uber.

execution of capital strategy during 2016, we continued to execute on many of the long-term components of our capital strategy. some of our key accomplishments include the following:
2016 capital strategy
•   achieved targeted key credit metric ratios, including a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of 6.1x and a fixed-charge coverage ratio of 3.8x for the fourth quarter of 2016 on an annualized basis;
•   continued the process of prudently laddering our debt maturities as we completed the successful offering in june 2016 of $350.0 million of unsecured senior notes payable with a stated interest rate of 3.95% due in 2027;
•   $2.2 billion of liquidity as of december 31, 2016;
•   executed additional interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $700 million during the year ended december 31, 2016, to provide a minimum of hedged variable-rate debt of $900 million and $450 million as of december 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively;
•   as of december 31, 2016, our unhedged variable-rate debt as a percentage to total debt was 4%;
•   in april 2016, we closed a secured construction loan for our development project at 100 binney street in our cambridge submarket:
•   commitments available for borrowing of $304.3 million;
•   outstanding borrowings bearing interest at a rate of libor+200 bps; and
•   executed 2.00% libor rate cap agreements for notional amounts up to $150 million;
•   on july 29, 2016, we amended our unsecured senior line of credit with key changes summarized as follows:
amended agreement   prior agreement commitments     $1.65 billion       $1.5 billion interest rate   libor+1.00%         libor+1.10%
maturity date   october 29, 2021    january 3, 2019
•   on july 29, 2016, we completed a partial principal repayment of $200 million of our 2019 unsecured senior bank term loan, reducing the total outstanding balance from $600 million to $400 million;
•   completed our december 2015 atm program during the first half of 2016, when we sold an aggregate of 3.9 million shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of $374.3 million, or $94.80 per share, and net proceeds of approximately $367.8 million;
•   established a new atm common stock offering program in october 2016 that allowed us to sell up to an aggregate of $600.0 million. during the three months ended december 31, 2016, we sold an aggregate of 3.4 million shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of $354.2 million, or $105.73 per share, and net proceeds of approximately $348.4 million;
•   raised $380.9 million in 2016 from (i) completed dispositions aggregating $274.6 million and (ii) funding from our joint venture partner, primarily in 2016, aggregating $106.3 million related to the sale of a partial interest in 10290 campus point drive. refer to "real estate asset sales" within this item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information;
•   maintained a high-quality tenant base as of december 31, 2016, with 49% of our annual rental revenue from investment-grade tenants;
•   continued to access diverse sources of capital, including joint venture capital aggregating $256.3 million from the sale of a 45.0% partial interest in 10290 and 10300 campus point drive to a high-quality institutional partner;
•   continued to allocate substantially all of our external growth capital to class a properties located in world-class collaborative life science and technology campuses in aaa urban innovation clusters; and
•   reduced our investment in the current and future value-creation pipeline to 10% of gross investments in real estate in north america as of december 31, 2016, with a target of less than 10%.
during 2017, we intend to continue to execute our capital strategy to achieve further improvements to our credit rating, which will allow us to further improve our cost of capital and continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation. for further information, refer to the "projected results" section below within this item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k.

balance sheet management as described above, we successfully executed our long-term capital strategy in 2016, continuing to strengthen our balance sheet and credit profile. consistent with 2016, our capital strategy for 2017 consists of the following elements:
•   allocate capital to class a properties located in world-class collaborative life science and technology campuses in aaa urban innovation clusters;
•   continue to improve our credit profile;
•   maintain access to diverse sources of capital, which includes cash flows from operating activities after dividends, incremental debt supported by our growth in ebitda, asset sales, joint venture capital, and other capital such as the sale of equity;
•   maintain commitment to long-term capital to fund growth;
•   prudently ladder debt maturities;
•   maintain significant balance sheet liquidity; and
•   maintain a stable and flexible balance sheet.
given the anticipated delivery of significant incremental ebitda from our development and redevelopment of new class a properties, we expect to obtain debt for a significant portion of construction on a leverage-neutral basis. we expect to continue to maintain access to a diverse source of debt, including unsecured senior notes payable, as well as secured construction loans for our development and redevelopment projects from time to time. we expect to continue to maintain a significant proportion of our net operating income unencumbered to allow for future flexibility for accessing both unsecured and secured debt markets, although we expect traditional secured mortgage notes payable will remain a small component of our capital structure.
in addition to debt funding on a leverage-neutral basis, we intend to supplement our remaining capital needs with cash flows from operating activities, after dividends and proceeds from asset sales, real estate joint ventures, and other equity capital. we pursued a strategy of asset sales in 2016 that combined the sales of partial real estate joint venture interests in low cap rate operating assets to high-quality institutional investors and the sales of certain land parcels and non-core operating assets, which allowed us to increase the quality of our asset base and to realize through sales a portion of the significant incremental net asset value we created in the class a properties. we expect to identify additional real estate assets for sale in 2017 using a similar strategy over the next several quarters to generate additional proceeds for reinvestment into our value-creation projects, subject to market conditions. the amount of asset sales necessary to meet our sources of capital forecast will vary depending upon the amount of ebitda associated with the assets sold. for example, the sale of an income-producing property benefits leverage less than the sale of a non-income-producing land parcel. we may also sell additional common equity subject to market conditions. additionally, other capital activity in 2017 will also be considered and will influence the amount of real estate disposition.
improved cost of capital as part of our capital strategy to continue strengthening our credit profile, we expect to complete and place into service development and redevelopment projects currently under construction, which we expect will deliver significant incremental ebitda. as our ebitda grows in 2017 and beyond, this growth in ebitda should allow us to obtain debt funding on a leverage-neutral basis and provide significant capital to fund our development and redevelopment projects. additionally, the resulting improvement in our balance sheet leverage ratio should allow us to access diverse sources of capital, strengthen our credit profile, and reduce our cost of capital. in addition, we expect to continue to maintain a significant proportion of unencumbered net operating income. for the year ended december 31, 2016, our unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income was 85%.

investments we hold equity investments in certain publicly traded companies, privately held entities, and limited partnerships primarily involved in the life science and technology industries.

as of december 31, 2016, we had cip related to our seven development projects and one redevelopment project. the completion of these projects, along with projects recently placed into service, certain future projects, and operations from same properties, is expected to contribute significant increases in rental income, net operating income, and cash flows. operating performance assumptions related to the completion of our development and redevelopment projects, including the timing of initial occupancy, stabilization dates, and initial stabilized yield, are included in the "investments in real estate" section under item 2 of this annual report on form 10-k. certain key assumptions regarding our projections, including assumptions related to various development and redevelopment projects, are reflected in the tables above and in the "projected construction spending" table in the "investments in real estate" section under item 2 of this annual report on form 10-k.

the completion of our development and redevelopment projects will result in an increase in interest expense and other project costs, because these project costs will no longer qualify for capitalization and will, therefore, be expensed as incurred. our projection assumptions for same properties net operating income growth, rental rate growth, straight-line rent, general and administrative expenses, capitalization of interest, and interest expense are included in the tables above and are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties, including those discussed in item 1a and within this item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k. to the extent our full-year earnings guidance is updated during the year, we will provide additional disclosure supporting reasons for any significant changes to such guidance.
liquidity and capital resources overview we expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements, such as requirements for development, redevelopment, other construction projects, capital improvements, tenant improvements, property acquisitions, leasing costs, non-revenue-enhancing capital expenditures, scheduled debt maturities, distributions to noncontrolling interests, and dividends through net cash provided by operating activities, periodic asset sales, strategic real estate joint venture capital, and long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness, including borrowings under our $1.65 billion unsecured senior line of credit, unsecured senior bank term loans, and the issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities.
we expect to continue meeting our short-term liquidity and capital requirements, as further detailed in this section, generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities. we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make the distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a reit.
over the next several years, our balance sheet, capital structure, and liquidity objectives are as follows:
•   retain positive cash flows from operating activities after payment of dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests for investment in development and redevelopment projects and/or acquisitions;
•   maintain significant liquidity from net cash provided by operating activities, cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, available-for-sale equity securities, available borrowing capacity under our $1.65 billion unsecured senior line of credit, and available commitments under our secured construction loans;
•   reduce the aggregate amount outstanding under our unsecured senior bank term loans;
•   maintain a well-laddered debt maturity profile;
•   maintain diverse sources of capital, including sources from net cash provided by operating activities, unsecured debt, secured debt, selective asset sales, joint venture capital, preferred stock, and common stock;
•   mitigate unhedged variable-rate debt exposure through the reduction of short-term and medium-term variable-rate bank debt;
•   maintain a large unencumbered asset pool to provide financial flexibility;
•   fund preferred stock and common stock dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests from net cash provided by operating activities;
•   manage a disciplined level of value-creation projects as a percentage of our gross investments in real estate;
•   maintain high levels of pre-leasing and percentage leased in value-creation projects; and
•   decrease the ratio of net debt to adjusted ebitda and net debt and preferred stock to adjusted ebitda, with some variation from quarter to quarter and year to year.

borrowings under our $1.65 billion unsecured senior line of credit bear interest at libor or the base rate specified in the amended $1.65 billion unsecured senior line of credit agreement plus, in either case, a specified margin (the "applicable margin"). the applicable margin for libor borrowings under the $1.65 billion unsecured senior line of credit is based on our existing credit rating as set by certain rating agencies. our $1.65 billion unsecured senior line of credit contains a feature that allows lenders to competitively bid on the interest rate for borrowings under the facility. this may result in an interest rate that is below the stated rate. in addition to the applicable margin, our $1.65 billion unsecured senior line of credit is subject to an annual facility fee of 0.20% based on the aggregate commitments.

(1)   includes our share of the proceeds from the anticipated sale of a condo interest in 203,090 rsf of our unconsolidated real estate joint venture development project at 360 longwood avenue, aggregating approximately $65.7 million, pursuant to the exercise of a purchase option by the anchor tenant. the sale is expected to close in mid-2017.
(2)   includes the acquisition of 88 bluxome street in our mission bay/soma submarket of san francisco for $130.0 million, which closed in january 2017, and $56.8 million related to 1455 and 1515 third street in our mission bay/soma submarket. refer to "acquisitions in 2016" in the "executive summary" section within this item 7 for additional information.
the key assumptions behind the sources and uses of capital in the table above include a favorable capital market environment, performance of our core operating properties, lease-up and delivery of current and future development and redevelopment projects, and leasing activity. our expected sources and uses of capital are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties, including those discussed under item 1a and within this item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k. we expect to update our forecast of sources and uses of capital on a quarterly basis.
sources of capital net cash provided by operating activities after dividends we expect to retain $115.0 million to $135.0 million of net cash flows from operating activities after payment of common stock and preferred stock dividends. for the year ending december 31, 2017, we expect the completion of our highly pre-leased value- creation projects, along with recently delivered projects, certain future projects, recently acquired properties, and contributions from same properties, to contribute significant increases in rental revenue, net operating income, and cash flows. refer to the "cash flows" section within this item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2016.
93
real estate dispositions and common equity we expect to continue the disciplined execution of select sales of non-strategic land and non-core/"core-like" operating assets. the sale of non-strategic land and non-core/"core-like" operating assets provides an important source of capital to fund a portion of our highly leased value-creation development and redevelopment projects. we may also consider additional sales of partial interests in core class a properties and/or development projects. for 2017, we expect real estate dispositions and issuances of common equity ranging from $450 million to $720 million. the amount of asset sales necessary to meet our forecasted sources of capital will vary depending upon the amount of ebitda associated with the assets sold. in addition, the amount of common equity issued will be subject to market conditions.
for additional information, refer to "sales of real estate assets and related impairment charges" in note 3 - "investments in real estate" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k.
debt we expect to fund a significant portion of our capital needs in 2017 from the issuance of unsecured senior notes payable, borrowings available under existing secured construction loans, $1.65 billion unsecured senior line of credit, and new secured construction loans.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, we repaid six secured notes payable aggregating $307.0 million with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 4.58%.
in november 2016, we acquired one kendall square, a 644,771 rsf, nine-building collaborative life science and technology campus located in our cambridge urban innovation cluster submarket in greater boston. the purchase price was $725.0 million, including the assumption of a $203.0 million secured note payable. the secured note payable has a maturity date of february 2024 and a contractual interest rate of 4.82%.
in june 2016, we completed a $350 million public offering of our unsecured senior notes payable due on january 15, 2027, at a stated interest rate of 3.95%. the unsecured senior notes payable are unsecured obligations of the company and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by alexandria real estate equities, l.p., a 100% owned subsidiary of the company. the unsecured senior notes payable rank equally in right of payment with all other unsecured senior indebtedness. however, the unsecured senior notes payable are subordinate to existing and future mortgages and other secured indebtedness (to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness) and to all existing and future preferred equity and liabilities, whether secured or unsecured, of the company's subsidiaries, other than alexandria real estate equities, l.p. we used the net proceeds, after discounts and issuance costs, of $344.7 million to repay outstanding principal borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit.
in july 2016, we amended our unsecured senior line of credit and increased aggregate commitments available for borrowing by $150 million to an aggregate of $1.65 billion, extended the maturity date to october 29, 2021, which includes two, six-month options to extend, reduced the interest rate on outstanding borrowings to libor+1.00% from libor+1.10%, and modified certain financial covenant computations and other non-financial covenants. in addition, we amended our 2019 and 2021 unsecured senior bank term loans to conform the financial covenant computations and other non-financial covenants to our $1.65 billion unsecured senior line of credit and completed a partial principal repayment of $200.0 million of our 2019 unsecured senior bank term loan, reducing the total outstanding balance from $600 million to $400 million. refer to note 9 - "secured and unsecured senior debt" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k.

secured construction loans refer to note 9 - "secured and unsecured senior debt" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of our secured construction loans.
$1.65 billion unsecured senior line of credit we use our $1.65 billion unsecured senior line of credit to fund working capital, construction activities, and, from time to time, acquisition of properties. borrowings under the $1.65 billion unsecured senior line of credit will bear interest at a "eurocurrency rate" or a "base rate" specified in the amended $1.65 billion unsecured line of credit agreement plus, in either case, the applicable margin. the eurocurrency rate specified in the amended $1.65 billion unsecured line of credit agreement is, as applicable, the rate per annum equal to (i) the libor or a successor rate thereto as approved by the administrative agent for loans denominated in a libor quoted currency (i.e., u.s. dollars, euro, sterling, or yen), (ii) the average annual yield rates applicable to canadian dollar bankers' acceptances for loans denominated in canadian dollars, (iii) the bank bill swap reference bid rate for loans denominated in australian dollars, or (iv) the rate designated with respect to the applicable alternative currency for loans denominated in a non-libor quoted currency (other than canadian or australian dollars). the base rate means, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1.00%, (ii) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced, from time to time, by bank of america as its "prime rate," and (iii) the eurocurrency rate plus 1.00%. our $1.65 billion unsecured senior line of credit contains a feature that allows lenders to competitively bid on the interest rate for borrowings under the facility. this may result in an interest rate that is below the stated rate. in addition to the cost of borrowing, the facility is subject to an annual facility fee of 0.20% based on the aggregate commitments outstanding.
cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $125.0 million and $125.1 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents. we expect existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operating activities, proceeds from asset sales, borrowings under our $1.65 billion unsecured senior line of credit, secured construction loan borrowings, issuances of unsecured notes payable, and issuances of common stock to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, distributions to noncontrolling interests, scheduled debt repayments, and certain capital expenditures, including expenditures related to construction activities.

atm common stock offering program during the six months ended june 30, 2016, we completed our atm common stock offering program that was established in december 2015, which allowed us to sell up to an aggregate of $450.0 million of our common stock. during the three months ended december 31, 2015, we sold an aggregate of 832,982 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $75.0 million, or $90.04 per share, and net proceeds of approximately $73.4 million. during the six months ended june 30, 2016, we sold an aggregate of 3.9 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $374.3 million, or $94.80 per share, and net proceeds of approximately $367.8 million. we used the proceeds from the sales to reduce amounts outstanding under our unsecured senior line of credit. as of june 30, 2016, there was no remaining availability under this atm program.
in october 2016, we established a new atm common stock offering program, which allows us to sell up to an aggregate of $600.0 million of our common stock. during the three months ended december 31, 2016, we sold an aggregate of 3.4 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $354.2 million, or $105.73 per share, and net proceeds of approximately $348.4 million. we used the proceeds from the sales to reduce amounts outstanding under our $1.65 billion unsecured senior line of credit. as of december 31, 2016, the remaining aggregate proceeds that can be generated under our current atm program through the future stock sales are approximately $245.8 million.
forward equity sales agreements during the three months ended december 31, 2016, we sold an aggregate of 7.5 million shares of common stock pursuant to the settlement of forward equity sales agreements executed in july 2016. net proceeds, after issuance costs and underwriters' discount, of $715.9 million were used to fund the acquisition of one kendall square, located in east cambridge, to lower debt, and to fund construction.
other sources under our current shelf registration statement filed with the sec, we may offer common stock, preferred stock, debt, and other securities. these securities may be issued, from time to time, at our discretion based on our needs and market conditions, including as necessary to balance our use of incremental debt capital.
we hold interests, together with certain third parties, in companies that we consolidate in our financial statements. these third parties may contribute equity into these entities primarily related to their share of funds for construction and financing-related activities. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we received contributions from and sales of noncontrolling interests of $221.6 million.

$185,666
(1)   we have two, one-year options to extend the stated maturity date to april 1, 2019, subject to certain conditions. in connection with the anticipated sale of a condo interest in 203,090 rsf of the 360 longwood avenue real estate joint venture in mid-2017, the real estate joint venture expects to refinance the existing secured construction loan.
(2)   borrowings under the floating rate tranche have an interest rate floor equal to 5.25% and are subject to an interest rate cap on libor of 3.50%.
uses of capital acquisitions refer to the "acquisitions in 2016" in note 3 - "investment in real estate" and note 4 - "investment in unconsolidated real estate joint venture" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for detailed information on our acquisitions.
summary of capital expenditures our primary use of capital relates to the development, redevelopment, predevelopment, and construction of properties. we currently have projects in our visible growth pipeline aggregating 1.9 million rsf of office/laboratory and tech office space. we incur capitalized construction costs related to development, redevelopment, predevelopment, and other construction activities. we also incur additional capitalized project costs, including interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the development or construction of a project during periods when activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are in progress. refer to "summary of capital expenditures" in the "investment in real estate" section under item 2 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information on our capital expenditures.
we capitalize interest cost as a cost of the project only during the period for which activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are ongoing, provided that expenditures for the asset have been made and interest cost has been incurred. capitalized interest for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, of $52.5 million and $36.5 million, respectively, is classified in investments in real estate. indirect project costs, including construction administration, legal fees, and office costs that clearly relate to projects under development or construction, are capitalized as incurred during the period an asset is undergoing activities to prepare it for its intended use. we capitalized payroll and other indirect project costs related to development, redevelopment, and construction projects aggregating approximately $14.7 million and $12.4 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. should we cease activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use, the interest, taxes, insurance, and certain other direct project costs related to this asset would be expensed as incurred. when construction activities cease, the asset is transferred out of cip and classified as rental property. also, if vertical aboveground construction is not initiated at completion of predevelopment activities, the land parcel is classified as land held for future development. expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total expenses and net income. for example, had we experienced a 10% reduction in development, redevelopment, and construction activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, including interest and payroll, total expenses would have increased by approximately $6.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2016.
97
we also capitalize and defer initial direct costs to originate leases with independent third parties related to evaluating a prospective lessee's financial condition, negotiating lease terms, preparing the lease agreement, and closing the lease transaction. costs that we capitalized and deferred relate to successful leasing transactions, result directly from and are essential to the lease transaction, and would not have been incurred had that lease transaction not occurred. the initial direct costs capitalized and deferred also include the portion of our employees' total compensation and payroll-related benefits directly related to time spent performing activities previously described and related to the respective lease that would not have been performed but for that lease. total initial direct leasing costs capitalized during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, were $40.1 million and $67.5 million, respectively, of which $12.2 million and $12.1 million, respectively, represented capitalized and deferred payroll costs directly related and essential to our leasing activities during such periods.

estimated interest payments estimated interest payments on our fixed-rate and hedged variable-rate debt were calculated based upon contractual interest rates, including estimated interest expense related to interest rate hedge agreements, interest payment dates, and scheduled maturity dates. as of december 31, 2016, approximately 96% of our debt was fixed-rate debt or variable-rate debt subject to interest rate hedge agreements. refer to our interest rate hedge agreements in "contractual obligations and commitments" and "interest rate hedge agreements" in the "sources and uses of capital" sections within this item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information. the remaining 4% of our debt as of december 31, 2016, was unhedged variable-rate debt based primarily on libor. interest payments on our unhedged variable-rate debt have been calculated based on interest rates in effect as of december 31, 2016. for additional information regarding our debt, refer to note 9 - "secured and unsecured senior debt" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k.
interest rate hedge agreements we utilize interest rate derivatives to hedge a portion of our exposure to volatility in variable interest rates primarily associated with our $1.65 billion unsecured senior line of credit, unsecured senior bank term loans, and variable-rate secured construction loans. our derivative instruments include interest rate swaps and interest rate caps.
in june 2016, we executed two interest rate cap agreements to hedge the cash flows and manage our exposure to interest rate movements related to our variable-rate construction loan secured by our property located at 100 binney street in our cambridge submarket in greater boston. the agreements are effective from july 29, 2016, through april 20, 2019, and will cap libor at 2.00% for two notional amounts, based on scheduled increases over the term of the cap, aggregating $55 million as of december 31, 2016, and up to $150 million of the loan.
our interest rate swap agreements involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for our payment of fixed-rate amounts to the counterparty over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. interest received under all of our interest rate swap agreements is based on one-month libor. the net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
we have entered into master derivative agreements with each respective counterparty. these master derivative agreements (all of which are adapted from the standard international swaps and derivatives association, inc. form) define certain terms between us and each of our counterparties to address and minimize certain risks associated with our interest rate hedge agreements. in order to limit our risk of non-performance by an individual counterparty under our interest rate hedge agreements, these agreements are spread among various counterparties. the largest aggregate notional amount in effect at any single point in time with an individual counterparty in our interest rate hedge agreements existing as of december 31, 2016, was $200 million. if one or more of our counterparties fail to perform under our interest rate hedge agreements, we may incur higher costs associated with our variable-rate libor-based debt than the interest costs we originally anticipated. we have not posted any collateral related to our interest rate hedge agreements.
ground lease obligations ground lease obligations as of december 31, 2016, included leases for 28 of our properties, which accounted for approximately 14% of our total number of properties and one land development parcel. excluding one ground lease related to one operating property that expires in 2036 with a net book value of $9.9 million as of december 31, 2016, our ground lease obligations have remaining lease terms ranging from approximately 40 to 100 years, including extension options. refer to note 14 - "commitments and contingencies" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our ground leases.
commitments as of december 31, 2016, remaining aggregate costs under contract for the construction of properties undergoing development, redevelopment, and improvements under the terms of leases approximated $555.8 million. we expect payments for these obligations to occur over one to three years, subject to capital planning adjustments from time to time. we may have the ability to cease the construction of certain properties, which would result in the reduction of our commitments. we are also committed to funding approximately $123.9 million for certain non-real estate investments over the next several years.
99
in addition, we have letters of credit and performance obligations aggregating $18.6 million primarily related to our construction management requirements in north america.
exposure to environmental liabilities in connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have obtained phase i environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues. the phase i environmental assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the phase i environmental assessments were completed. in addition, we carry a policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to certain environmental losses at substantially all of our properties.

cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our asset base, the rental rates of our leases, the collectability of rent and recovery of operating expenses from our tenants, the timing of completion of development projects, the timing of completion of redevelopment projects, and the timing of acquisitions of operating properties. net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2016, increased to $392.5 million, compared to $342.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities for the year ended december 31, 2016, increased by $61.9 million, or 16.6%, to $435.1 million, compared to $373.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in highly leased development and redevelopment projects being placed into service subsequent to january 1, 2015, acquisitions since january 1, 2015, and increases in our same property average occupancy and rental rates on lease renewals and re-leasing of space since january 1, 2015.

$262,761                  $243,090           $19,671
the increase in dividends paid on our common stock was primarily due to an increase in the related dividends to $3.17 per common share paid during the year ended december 31, 2016, from $3.02 per common share paid during the year ended december 31, 2015, and partially due to the increase in number of common shares outstanding for the comparative periods. the decrease in dividends paid on our series d convertible preferred stock was primarily due to the repurchases of the stock during the year ended december 31, 2016.
inflation as of december 31, 2016, approximately 97% of our leases (on an rsf basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. approximately 96% of our leases (on an rsf basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from 3.0% to 3.5%) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other indices. accordingly, we do not believe that our cash flows or earnings from real estate operations are subject to significant risks from inflation. an increase in inflation, however, could result in an increase in the cost of our variable-rate borrowings, including borrowings related to our $1.65 billion unsecured senior line of credit, unsecured senior bank term loans, and secured construction loans.

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. we base these estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
we continually evaluate the policies and estimates we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. changes in estimates or policies applied could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by our stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts, and lenders in their evaluation of our performance. our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 - "basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k.
reit compliance we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code to our operations and financial results, and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. we believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code to enable us to qualify, and continue to qualify, as a reit. however, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a reit, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify.
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal and state income taxes (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. if we lose our reit status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to our stockholders will be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we will no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders.
investments in real estate and properties classified as held for sale we recognize real estate acquired (including the intangible value of acquired above- or below-market leases, acquired in-place leases, tenant relationships, and other intangible assets or liabilities), liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in an acquired entity at their fair value as of the acquisition date. if there is a bargain fixed-rate renewal option for the period beyond the non-cancelable lease term of an in-place lease, we evaluate factors such as the business conditions in the industry in which the lessee operates, the economic conditions in the area in which the property is located, and the ability of the lessee to sublease the property during the renewal term, in order to determine the likelihood that the lessee will renew. when we determine there is reasonable assurance that such bargain purchase option will be exercised, we consider the option in determining the intangible value of such lease and its related amortization period. the value of tangible assets acquired is based upon our estimation of value on an "as if vacant" basis. the value of acquired in-place leases includes the estimated costs during the hypothetical lease-up period and other costs that would have been incurred in the execution of similar leases under the market conditions at the acquisition date of the acquired in-place lease. we assess the fair value of tangible and intangible assets based on numerous factors, including estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors, including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property. we also recognize the fair values of assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in acquisitions of less than a 100% interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity. acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition of businesses are expensed as incurred, while acquisition costs related to the acquisition of assets are capitalized.
the values allocated to buildings and building improvements, land improvements, tenant improvements, and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis using the shorter of the term of the respective ground lease and up to 40 years for buildings and building improvements, an estimated life of up to 20 years for land improvements, the respective lease term for tenant improvements, and the estimated useful life for equipment. the values of acquired above- and below-market leases are amortized over the terms of the related leases and recognized as either an increase (for below-market leases) or a decrease (for above-market leases) to rental revenue. the values of acquired above- and below-market ground leases are amortized over the terms of the related ground leases and recognized as either an increase (for below-market ground leases) or a decrease (for above-market ground leases) to rental operating expense. the values of acquired in-place leases are classified in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases.
103
we capitalize project costs, including predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the development, redevelopment, predevelopment, or construction of a project. capitalization of development, redevelopment, predevelopment, and construction costs is required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, predevelopment, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total expenses and net income. costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred. should development, redevelopment, predevelopment, or construction activity cease, interest, property taxes, insurance, and certain other costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization and would be expensed as incurred. expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
a property is classified as held for sale when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (i) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property; (ii) the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary; (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell have been initiated; (iv) the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within one year; (v) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (vi) actions necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. depreciation of assets ceases upon designation of a property as held for sale.
if the disposal of the property represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on our operations or financial results, such as (i) a major line of business, (ii) a major geographic area, (iii) a major equity method investment, or (iv) other major parts of an entity, then the operations of the property, including any interest expense directly attributable to it, are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations, and amounts for all prior periods presented are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations. the disposal of an individual property generally will not represent a strategic shift and, therefore, will typically not meet the criteria for classification as discontinued operations.
impairment of long-lived assets on a quarterly basis, we review current activities and changes in the business conditions of all of our properties prior to and subsequent to the end of each quarter to determine the existence of any triggering events requiring an impairment analysis. if triggering events are identified, we review an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows for the properties, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration.
long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, cip, land held for development, and intangibles, are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist that may indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. the carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. impairment indicators or triggering events for long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, cip, land held for development, and intangibles, are assessed by project and include significant fluctuations in estimated rental revenues less rental operating expenses, occupancy changes, significant near-term lease expirations, current and historical operating and/or cash flow losses, construction costs, estimated completion dates, rental rates, and other market factors. we assess the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, construction costs, available market information, current and historical operating results, known trends, current market/economic conditions that may affect the property, and our assumptions about the use of the asset, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration. upon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-down is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value. if an impairment loss is not required to be recognized, the recognition of depreciation is adjusted prospectively, as necessary, to reduce the carrying amount of the real estate to its estimated disposition value over the remaining period that the real estate is expected to be held and used. we may adjust depreciation of properties that are expected to be disposed of or redeveloped prior to the end of their useful lives.
we use the held for sale impairment model for our properties classified as held for sale. the held for sale impairment model is different from the held and used impairment model. under the held for sale impairment model, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the long-lived asset classified as held for sale exceeds its fair value less cost to sell. because of these two different models, it is possible for a long-lived asset previously classified as held and used to require the recognition of an impairment charge upon classification as held for sale.
104
investments we hold equity investments in certain publicly traded companies, privately held entities, and limited partnerships primarily involved in the life science and technology industries. all of our equity investments in actively traded public companies are considered available-for-sale and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value. fair value has been determined based upon the closing price as of each balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses shown as a separate component of other comprehensive income. the classification of each investment is determined at the time each investment is made, and such determination is reevaluated at each balance sheet date. the cost of each investment sold is determined by the specific identification method, with realized gains or losses classified in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the cost method when our interest in the entity is so minor that we have virtually no influence over the entity's operating and financial policies. certain investments in privately held entities require accounting under the equity method unless our interest in the entity is deemed to be so minor that we have virtually no influence over the entity's operating and financial policies. under the equity method of accounting, we recognize our investment initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount of the investment to recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the date of our investment. additionally, we limit our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity to less than 10%. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity was less than 10%.
we monitor each of our investments throughout the year for new developments, including operating results, results of clinical trials, capital-raising events, and merger and acquisition activities. individual investments are evaluated for impairment when changes in conditions may indicate an impairment exists. the factors that we consider in making these assessments include, but are not limited to, market prices, market conditions, available financing, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives, and new collaborative agreements. if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that might have an adverse effect on our cost method investments, we do not estimate the investment's fair value. for all of our investments, if a decline in the fair value of an investment below the carrying value is determined to be other than temporary, such investment is written down to its estimated fair value with a charge to current earnings.
interest rate hedge agreements we are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions. we principally manage our exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of our core business activities. we manage economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding and by entering into interest rate hedge agreements. specifically, we enter into interest rate hedge agreements to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. our interest rate hedge agreements are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of our known or expected cash payments principally related to our borrowings based on libor. we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes, and currently all of our derivatives are designated as hedges. our objectives in using interest rate hedge agreements are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements in accordance with our interest rate risk management strategy. all of our interest rate hedges are designated as cash flow hedges. interest rate hedge agreements designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the company's making fixed-rate payments over the life of the interest rate hedge agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount of interest rate hedge agreements.
105
we utilize interest rate hedge agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with borrowings based on libor. we recognize our interest rate hedge agreements as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value. the accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship. for those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based on the hedged exposure, as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. our interest rate hedge agreements are considered cash flow hedges because they are designated and qualify as hedges of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows. hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the earnings effect of the hedged transactions in a cash flow hedge. all of our interest rate hedge agreements meet the criteria to be deemed "highly effective" in reducing our exposure to variable interest rates. we formally document all relationships between interest rate hedge agreements and hedged items, including the method for evaluating effectiveness and the risk strategy. we make an assessment at the inception of each interest rate hedge agreement and on an ongoing basis to determine whether these instruments are "highly effective" in offsetting changes in cash flows associated with the hedged items. the ineffective portion of each interest rate hedge agreement is immediately recognized in earnings. while we intend to continue to meet the conditions for such hedge accounting, if hedges did not qualify as "highly effective," the changes in the fair values of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings.
the effective portion of changes in the fair value of our interest rate hedge agreements that are designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. amounts classified in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings.
the fair value of each interest rate hedge agreement is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analyses on the expected cash flows of each derivative. these analyses reflect the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and use observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. the fair values of our interest rate hedge agreements are determined using the market-standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed-cash payments and the discounted expected variable-cash receipts. the variable-cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. the fair value calculation also includes an amount for risk of non-performance of our counterparties using "significant unobservable inputs," such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default, which we have determined to be insignificant to the overall fair value of our interest rate hedge agreements.
recognition of rental revenue and tenant recoveries rental revenue from leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms. we classify amounts currently recognized as income and expected to be received in later years as deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. amounts received currently but recognized as income in future years are classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and tenant security deposits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. we commence recognition of rental revenue at the date the property is ready for its intended use and the tenant takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property.
tenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period during which the applicable expenses are incurred.
tenant receivables consist primarily of amounts due for contractual lease payments, reimbursements of common area maintenance expenses, property taxes, and other expenses recoverable from tenants. tenant receivables are expected to be collected within one year. we may maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make payments required under the terms of the lease and for tenant recoveries due. if a tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of uncollectible rent and deferred rent receivables arising from the straight-lining of rent. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, no allowance for uncollectible tenant receivables and deferred rent was deemed necessary.
106
monitoring tenant credit quality during the term of each lease, we monitor the credit quality of our tenants by (i) monitoring the credit rating of tenants that are rated by a nationally recognized credit rating agency, (ii) reviewing financial statements of the tenants that are publicly available or that are required to be delivered to us pursuant to the applicable lease, (iii) monitoring news reports regarding our tenants and their respective businesses, and (iv) monitoring the timeliness of lease payments. we have a research team consisting of employees who, among them, have graduate and undergraduate degrees in biology, chemistry, and industrial biotechnology and experience in the life science and technology industries, as well as in finance. our research team is responsible for assessing and monitoring the credit quality of our tenants and any material changes in their credit quality.
non-gaap measures this section contains additional information of certain non-gaap financial measures and the reasons why we use these supplemental measures of performance and believe they provide useful information to investors, as well as the definitions of other terms used in this annual report on form 10-k.
funds from operations and funds from operations, as adjusted (attributable to alexandria real estate equities, inc.'s common stockholders)
gaap-basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes that real estate values diminish over time. in an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets, the nareit board of governors established the measurement tool of funds from operations. since its introduction, funds from operations has become a widely used non-gaap financial measure among equity reits. we believe that funds from operations is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity reit. moreover, we believe that funds from operations, as adjusted, allows investors to compare our performance to the performance of other real estate companies on a consistent basis, without having to account for differences recognized because of investment and disposition decisions, financing decisions, capital structures, and capital market transactions. we compute funds from operations in accordance with standards established by the nareit board of governors in its april 2002 white paper and related implementation guidance (the "nareit white paper"). the nareit white paper defines funds from operations as net income (computed in accordance with gaap), excluding gains (losses) from sales of depreciable real estate and land parcels and impairments of depreciable real estate (excluding land parcels) plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for our share of consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and real estate joint ventures. impairments represent the write-down of assets when fair value over the recoverability period is less than the carrying value due to changes in general market conditions, which do not necessarily reflect the operating performance of the properties during the corresponding period.
we compute funds from operations, as adjusted, as funds from operations calculated in accordance with the nareit white paper less/plus significant gains/losses on the sale of investments, plus losses on early extinguishment of debt, preferred stock redemption charges, impairments of non-depreciable real estate and land parcels, impairments of non-real estate investments, and deal costs, and the amount of such items that is allocable to our unvested restricted stock awards. neither funds from operations nor funds from operations, as adjusted, should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with gaap) as an indication of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with gaap) as a measure of liquidity, nor are they indicative of the availability of funds for our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions.

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margins we use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental performance measure of our core operations for financial and operational decision making, and as a supplemental or additional means of evaluating period-to-period comparisons on a consistent basis. adjusted ebitda is calculated as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("ebitda"), excluding stock compensation expense, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, and impairments. we believe adjusted ebitda provides investors relevant and useful information because it allows investors to view income from our operations on an unleveraged basis before the effects of taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, and impairments.
109
by excluding interest expense and gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, adjusted ebitda allows investors to measure our performance independent of our capital structure and indebtedness. we believe that excluding charges related to share-based compensation facilitates a comparison of our operations across periods without the variances caused by the volatility of the expense (which depends on market forces outside our control). we believe that adjusting for the effects of impairments and gains or losses on sales of real estate allows investors to evaluate performance from period to period on a consistent basis without having to account for differences recognized because of investment and disposition decisions. adjusted ebitda has limitations as measures of our performance. adjusted ebitda does not reflect our historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. while adjusted ebitda is a relevant measure of performance, it does not represent net income or cash flows from operations determined in accordance with gaap, and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating performance or liquidity.

annual rental revenue annual rental revenue represents the annualized fixed base rental amount in effect as of the end of the period, related to our operating rsf (using rental revenue including straight line rent adjustments). annual rental revenue and measures computed using annual rental revenue are presented at 100% for all properties under our management, including properties held by our consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. as of december 31, 2016, approximately 97% of our leases (on an rsf basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. annual rental revenue excludes these operating expenses recovered from our tenants. amounts recovered from our tenants related to these operating expenses are classified in "tenant recoveries" in our consolidated statements of operations.
average cash yield see definition of initial stabilized yield (unlevered).
cash interest cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with gaap plus capitalized interest, less amortization of loan fees and amortization of debt premiums (discounts). see definition of fixed-charge coverage ratio for a reconciliation of interest expense, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, to cash interest.

class a properties and aaa locations class a properties are properties clustered in aaa locations that provide innovative tenants with highly dynamic and collaborative environments that enhance their ability to successfully recruit and retain world-class talent and inspire productivity, efficiency, creativity, and success. class a properties generally command higher annual rental revenue than other classes of similar properties.
aaa locations are in close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, knowledge, institutions, and related businesses. such locations are generally characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for tenants, and a limited supply of available space.
fixed-charge coverage ratio fixed-charge coverage ratio is a non-gaap financial measure representing the ratio of adjusted ebitda to fixed charges. this ratio is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of our ability to satisfy fixed financing obligations and preferred stock dividends. cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with gaap, plus capitalized interest, less amortization of loan fees and amortization of debt (premiums) discounts. the fixed-charge coverage ratio calculation below is not directly comparable to the computation of ratio of earnings to fixed charges as defined in item 503(d) of regulation s-k and to the computation of "consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges and consolidated ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends" included in exhibit 12.1 to this annual report on form 10-k.

initial stabilized yield (unlevered)
initial stabilized yield is calculated as the quotient of the estimated amounts of net operating income at stabilization and our investment in the property. our initial stabilized yield excludes the benefit of leverage. our cash rents related to our value-creation projects are expected to increase over time due to contractual annual rent escalations, and our average cash yields are generally expected to be greater than our initial stabilized yields (cash basis). our estimates for initial stabilized yields, initial stabilized yields (cash basis), and total costs at completion represent our initial estimates at the commencement of the project. we expect to update this information upon completion of the project, or sooner, if there are significant changes to the expected project yields or costs.
•   initial stabilized yield reflects rental income, including contractual rent escalations and any rent concessions over the term(s) of the lease(s), calculated on a straight-line basis.
•   initial stabilized yield (cash basis) reflects cash rents at the stabilization date after initial rental concessions, if any, have elapsed and our total cash investment in the property.
average cash yield reflects cash rents, including contractual rent escalations after initial rental concessions have elapsed, calculated on a straight-line basis, and our total cash investment in the property.
joint venture financial information we present components of operating results and balance sheet information related to our joint ventures, which are not in accordance with or intended to be presentations in accordance with gaap. we present the proportionate share of certain financial line items as follows: (i) for each real estate joint venture that we consolidate in our financial statements, but of which we own less than 100%, we apply the noncontrolling interest economic ownership percentage to each financial item to arrive at the amount of such noncontrolling interest share of each component presented; and (ii) for each real estate joint venture that we do not control, and do not consolidate, we apply our economic ownership percentage to each financial item to arrive at our proportionate share of each component presented.
the components of operating results and balance sheet information related to joint ventures do not represent our legal claim to those items. the joint venture agreement for each entity that we do not wholly own generally determines what equity holders can receive upon capital events, such as sales or refinancing, or in the event of a liquidation. equity holders are normally entitled to their respective legal ownership of any residual cash from a joint venture only after all liabilities, priority distributions, and claims have been repaid or satisfied.
we believe this information can help investors estimate the operating results and balance sheet information related to partially owned entities. presenting this information provides a perspective not immediately available from consolidated financial statements and one that can supplement an understanding of joint venture assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses included in our consolidated results.
the components of operating results and balance sheet information related to joint ventures are limited as an analytical tool, as the overall economic ownership interest does not represent our legal claim to each of our joint ventures' assets, liabilities, or results of operations. in addition, joint venture financial information may include financial information related to the unconsolidated real estate joint ventures that we do not control. we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results and our total assets and liabilities, joint venture financial information should be examined in conjunction with our consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets. joint venture financial information should not be considered an alternative to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with gaap.
net cash provided by operating activities after dividends net cash provided by operating activities after dividends includes the deduction for distributions to noncontrolling interests. for purposes of this calculation, changes in operating assets and liabilities are excluded as they represent timing differences.
net debt to adjusted ebitda and net debt and preferred stock to adjusted ebitda net debt to adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a supplemental measure in evaluating our balance sheet leverage. net debt is equal to the sum of total consolidated debt less cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. net debt and preferred stock is equal to the sum of net debt, as discussed above, plus preferred stock outstanding as of period end. refer to "adjusted ebitda" for further information on the calculation of adjusted ebitda.

net operating income is a non-gaap financial measure calculated as income (loss) from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, excluding our equity in the earnings (losses) of our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment of real estate, gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt, and gain or loss on sales of real estate. we believe net operating income provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it primarily reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. therefore, we believe net operating income is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets. net operating income on a cash basis is net operating income adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent and amortization of acquired above- and below-market lease revenue adjustments required by gaap. we believe that net operating income on a cash basis is helpful to investors as an additional measure of operating performance because it eliminates the timing differences between the recognition of revenue in accordance with gaap and the receipt of payments reflected in our consolidated results.
further, we believe net operating income is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, net operating income reflects trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, which provides a perspective not immediately apparent from income from continuing operations. net operating income can be used to measure the initial stabilized yields of our properties by calculating the quotient of net operating income generated by a property on a straight-line basis, and our investment in the property. net operating income excludes certain components from income from continuing operations in order to provide results that are more closely related to the results of operations of our properties. for example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level rather than at the property level. in addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort comparability of operating performance at the property level. impairments of real estate have been excluded in deriving net operating income because we do not consider impairments of real estate to be property-level operating expenses. impairments of real estate relate to changes in the values of our assets and do not reflect the current operating performance with respect to related revenues or expenses. our impairments of real estate represent the write-down in the value of the assets to the estimated fair value less cost to sell. these impairments result from investing decisions and deterioration in market conditions. our calculation of net operating income also excludes charges incurred from changes in certain financing decisions, such as loss on early extinguishment of debt, as these charges often relate to corporate strategy. property operating expenses that are included in determining net operating income primarily consist of costs that are related to our operating properties, such as utilities, repairs, and maintenance; rental expense related to ground leases; contracted services, such as janitorial, engineering, and landscaping; property taxes and insurance; and property-level salaries. general and administrative expenses consist primarily of accounting and corporate compensation, corporate insurance, professional fees, office rent, and office supplies that are incurred as part of corporate office management. we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, net operating income should be examined in conjunction with income (loss) from continuing operations as presented in our consolidated statements of operations. net operating income should not be considered as an alternative to income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure either of liquidity or our ability to make distributions.

operating statistics we present certain operating statistics related to our properties, including number of properties, annual rental revenue, annual rental revenue per occupied rsf, occupancy percentage, rsf, leasing activity, rental rates, and contractual lease expirations as of the end of the period. we believe these measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of certain trends for our properties. we compute operating statistics at 100% for all properties managed by us, including properties owned by our consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures.
stabilized occupancy date the stabilized occupancy date represents the estimated date on which the project is expected to reach occupancy of 95% or greater.
same property comparisons refer to the discussion of same properties in the "results of operations" section within this item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k.
total market capitalization total market capitalization is equal to the sum of total equity market capitalization and total debt. total equity market capitalization is equal to the sum of outstanding shares of series d convertible preferred stock, 6.45% series e cumulative redeemable preferred stock, and common stock multiplied by the related closing price of each class of security at the end of each period presented.
unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income is a non-gaap financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a performance measure of the results of operations of our unencumbered real estate assets, as it reflects primarily those income and expense items that are incurred at the unencumbered property level. we use unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income in order to assess our compliance with our financial covenants under our debt obligations because the measure serves as a proxy for a financial measure under such debt obligations. unencumbered net operating income is derived from assets classified in continuing operations, which are not subject to any mortgage, deed of trust, lien, or other security interest, as of the period for which income is presented.

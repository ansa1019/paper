item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the purpose of management's discussion and analysis is to provide an understanding of cincinnati financial corporation's consolidated results of operations and financial condition. our management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item 6, selected financial data, and item 8, consolidated financial statements and related notes. we present per share data on a diluted basis unless otherwise noted, adjusting those amounts for all stock splits and stock dividends.
we begin with an executive summary of our results of operations, followed by other highlights, an overview of our strategy, an outlook for future performance and details about critical accounting estimates. in several instances, we refer to estimated industry data so that we can provide information on our performance within the context of the overall insurance industry. unless otherwise noted, the industry data is prepared by a.m. best co., a leading insurance industry statistical, analytical and financial strength rating organization. information from a.m. best is presented on a statutory accounting basis. when we provide our results on a comparable statutory accounting basis, we label it as such; all other company data is presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (gaap).
through the cincinnati insurance company, cincinnati financial corporation is one of the 25 largest property casualty insurers in the nation, based on net written premium volume for the first nine months of 2016, among approximately 2,000 u.s. stock and mutual insurer groups. we market our insurance products through a select group of independent insurance agencies in 41 states as discussed in item 1, our business and our strategy.
the u.s. economy, the insurance industry and our company continue to face many challenges. our long-term perspective has allowed us to address immediate challenges while also focusing on the major decisions that best position the company for success through all market cycles. we believe that this forward-looking view consistently benefits our shareholders, agents, policyholders and associates.
to measure our progress, we have defined a measure of value creation that we believe captures the contribution of our insurance operations, the success of our investment strategy and the importance we place on paying cash dividends to shareholders. we refer to this measure as our value creation ratio, or vcr, and it is made up of two primary components: (1) our rate of growth in book value per share plus (2) the ratio of dividends declared per share to beginning book value per share. this measure, intended to be all-inclusive regarding changes in book value per share, uses originally reported book value per share in cases where book value per share has been adjusted, such as after the adoption of accounting standards updates with a cumulative effect of a change in accounting.

executive summary our value creation ratio, defined above, is our primary performance target. vcr trends are shown in the table below.
oneyear          three-year% average           five-year% average value creation ratio:
as of december 31, 2016       14.5     %             10.2           %             11.8           %

for the period 2013 through 2017, we are targeting an annual value creation ratio averaging 10 percent to 13 percent. at 14.5 percent for 2016, we exceeded the high end of that range. we were within that range for the three-year and five-year periods that ended in december 2016.
the next two tables show the primary components of our value creation ratio, first on a percentage basis and then on a per-outstanding-share basis. analysis of the components aids understanding of our financial performance. our financial results are further analyzed in the corporate financial highlights section below.

the 2016 value creation ratio improved by 11.1 percentage points, compared with 2015, and again included strong operating results as its primary contributor. the 2016 ratio improvement included 9.7 percentage points from a rise in market valuation for our equity securities investment portfolio. the 2015 value creation ratio was 9.2 percentage points lower than in 2014, driven by an 11.0 point reduction in the contribution from realized gains plus the change in unrealized gains from our investment portfolios in aggregate.

we believe our value creation ratio, a non-gaap measure, is a useful supplement to gaap information. with the continuation of economic and market uncertainty in recent years, the long-term nature of this measure provides a meaningful measure of our long-term progress in creating shareholder value. a reconciliation of this non-gaap measure to comparable gaap measures is shown in the table below.

* change in book value divided by the beginning of year book value
** dividend declared to shareholders divided by beginning of year book value when looking at our longer-term objectives, we see three primary performance drivers for our value creation ratio:
•   premium growth - we believe over any five-year period our agency relationships and initiatives can lead to a property casualty written premium growth rate that exceeds the industry average. the compound annual growth rate of our net written premiums was 8.1 percent over the five-year period 2012 through 2016, approximately double the 3.8 percent estimated growth rate for the property casualty insurance industry. the industry's growth rate excludes its mortgage and financial guaranty lines of business.
•   combined ratio - we believe our underwriting philosophy and initiatives can drive performance to achieve our underwriting profitability target of a gaap combined ratio over any five-year period that consistently averages within the range of 95 percent to 100 percent. our gaap combined ratio averaged 94.3 percent over the five-year period 2012 through 2016, better than the performance target range. performance as measured by the combined ratio is discussed in consolidated property casualty insurance results. our statutory combined ratio averaged 93.7 percent over the five-year period 2012 through 2016 compared with an estimated 99.1 percent for the property casualty industry. the industry's ratio again excludes its mortgage and financial guaranty lines of business.
•   investment contribution - we believe our investment philosophy and initiatives can drive investment income growth and lead to a total return on our equity investment portfolio over a five-year period that exceeds the five-year total return of the standard &amp; poor's 500 index.
◦   investment income growth, on a pretax basis, had a compound annual growth rate of 2.5 percent over the five-year period 2012 through 2016 and 4.0 percent over the three-year period 2014 through 2016. it has grown every year since 2009, except for 2013 with its slight decrease of less than 1 percent.
◦   over the five years ended december 31, 2016, our equity portfolio compound annual total return was 13.3 percent compared with a compound annual total return of 14.7 percent for the index. our equity portfolio favors larger-capitalization, high-quality, dividend growing stocks with a slight value orientation. in recent years, returns for this type of stocks have generally lagged the broader market. for the year 2016, our annual equity portfolio total return was 18.2 percent, compared with 12.0 percent for the index.
the board of directors is committed to rewarding shareholders directly through cash dividends and share repurchase authorizations. through 2016, the company has increased the annual cash dividend rate for 56 consecutive years, a record we believe is matched by only eight other publicly traded u.s. companies. in addition to regular dividends, excellent company performance provided the opportunity to further reward shareholders and was the main driver of a special dividend paid in december 2015. the board regularly evaluates relevant factors in dividend-related decisions, and the 2016 increase to the regular dividend reflected confidence in our strong capital, liquidity and financial flexibility, as well as progress through our initiatives to cincinnati financial corporation - 2016 10-k - page 44

total investments grew 7 percent during 2016 on a fair value basis, with an increase in our securities portfolio valuation that added to the 4 percent increase in its cost basis. entering 2017, we believe the portfolio continues to be well diversified and is well positioned to withstand short-term fluctuations. we discuss our investment strategy in item 1, investments segment, and results for the segment in investments results. total assets rose 8 percent. shareholders' equity and book value per share each grew by 10 percent, for reasons discussed in the preceding executive summary.
the amount of our debt obligations decreased by $14 million in 2016, compared with 2015. our 10.3 percent ratio of debt to total capital (debt plus shareholders' equity) at year-end 2016 decreased by 1.0 percentage point compared with the prior-year ratio and remained comfortably within our target range.

net income in 2016 decreased $43 million or 7 percent compared with 2015, driven by a decrease in property casualty underwriting income of $94 million after taxes, including $114 million from higher catastrophe losses. the 2016 decrease in property casualty underwriting income was partially offset by a $35 million increase in net realized investment gains after taxes and $17 million in investment income after taxes. dividend income rose 7 percent in 2016 while interest income rose 3 percent, driving a net increase in pretax investment income of $23 million, or 4 percent. our investment operation's performance is discussed further in investments results.
net income increased $109 million in 2015, compared with 2014, primarily due to a $130 million increase in property casualty underwriting income after taxes that included $28 million from lower catastrophe losses.

as discussed in investments results, sales of securities that had appreciated in value led to realized investment gains in all three years. realized and unrealized investment gains and losses are integral to our financial results over the long term. we have substantial discretion in the timing of investment sales and, therefore, the gains or losses that are recognized in any period. that discretion generally is independent of the insurance underwriting process.

property casualty net written premiums and earned premiums each grew 5 percent in 2016, reflecting average renewal price increases, a higher level of insured exposures and premium growth initiatives. premium growth rates in 2016 were similar to 2015. trends and related factors are discussed in commercial lines, personal lines and excess and surplus lines insurance results, respectively.
our property casualty insurance operations generated significant underwriting profits for each of the three years ending in 2016. the $144 million decrease in 2016, compared with 2015, included a $175 million increase in losses from natural catastrophe events. the $200 million increase in 2015, compared with 2014, included a $43 million decrease in losses from natural catastrophe events.
we measure property casualty underwriting profitability primarily by the combined ratio. our combined ratio measures the percentage of each earned premium dollar spent on claims plus all expenses related to our property casualty operations, all on a pretax basis. a lower ratio indicates more favorable results and better underlying performance. a ratio below 100 percent represents an underwriting profit. initiatives to improve our combined ratio are discussed in item 1, our business and our strategy, strategic initiatives. in 2016, 2015 and 2014, favorable development on reserves for claims that occurred in prior accident years helped offset other incurred losses and loss expenses. reserve development is discussed further in property casualty loss and loss expense obligations and reserves. losses from weather-related catastrophes are another important item influencing the combined ratio and are discussed along with other factors in financial results for our property casualty business and related segments.
our life insurance segment reported a $1 million profit in 2016 and a $2 million loss in 2015. we discuss results for the segment in life insurance results. most of this segment's investment income is included in our investments segment results. in addition to investment income, realized investment gains from the life insurance investment portfolio are also included in our investments segment results.
strategic initiatives overview management has worked to identify a strategy that can lead to long-term success, with concurrence by the board of directors. our strategy is intended to position us to compete successfully in the markets we have targeted while appropriately managing risk. we discuss our long-term, proven strategy in item 1, our business and our strategy. we believe successful implementation of initiatives that support our strategy will help us better serve our agent customers and reduce volatility in our financial results while we also grow earnings and book value over the long term, successfully navigating challenging economic, market or industry pricing cycles.
•   manage insurance profitability - implementation of these initiatives is intended to enhance underwriting expertise and knowledge, thereby increasing our ability to manage our business while also gaining efficiency. better profit margins can arise from additional information and more focused action on underperforming product lines, cincinnati financial corporation - 2016 10-k - page 46
plus pricing capabilities we are expanding through the use of technology and analytics. in addition to enhancing company efficiency, improving internal processes also supports the ability of the independent agencies that represent us to grow profitably by allowing them to serve clients faster and to more efficiently manage agency expenses.
•   drive premium growth - implementation of these initiatives is intended to further penetrate each market we serve through our independent agencies. strategies aimed at specific market opportunities, along with service enhancements, can help our agents grow and increase our share of their business. premium growth initiatives also include expansion of cincinnati re. diversified growth also may reduce variability of losses from weather-related catastrophes.
detailed discussion of recent-year financial performance influenced by our strategic initiatives appears below in financial results and liquidity and capital resources.
factors influencing our future performance our view of the shareholder value we can create over the next five years relies largely on three assumptions - each highly dependent on the external environment. first, we anticipate our property casualty average insurance prices will increase in proportion to, or in excess of, our loss cost trends. second, we assume that the economy can maintain a long-term growth track. third, we assume that valuations of our marketable securities will vary within a typical range over time, based on historical trends. if those assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may not be able to achieve our performance targets even if we accomplish our strategic objectives.
other factors that could influence our ability to achieve our targets include:
•   we expect the insurance marketplace to remain competitive, which is likely to cause carriers to pursue strategies that they believe could lead to economies of scale, market share gains or the potential for an improved competitive posture.
•   we expect the independent insurance agency system to remain strong, with continued agency consolidation. if soft insurance market conditions return in the near term, it will create additional risk for agencies.
•   a return of soft insurance market pricing could significantly affect growth rates and earned premium levels for some time into the future. if the economy falters, we may experience low or no premium growth for our property casualty segments. premium growth also may lag as some of our growth initiatives require more time to reach their full contribution. in addition, economic factors, including inflation, may increase our claims and settlement expenses related to medical care, litigation and construction.
•   financial markets continued to display volatility in recent years, and some predict more turbulence in the future from effects such as changes in government policy, growth challenges for emerging country economies or other geopolitical events that could also affect the u.s. economy and markets. should financial markets decline temporarily, which could occur as part of typical market volatility patterns, the related book value component of our value creation ratio could also register a weak or negative result.
we discuss in item 1a, risk factors, many potential risks to our business and our ability to achieve our qualitative and quantitative objectives. these are real risks, but their probability of occurring may not be high. we also believe that our risk management programs generally could mitigate their potential effects, in the event they would occur.

critical accounting estimates cincinnati financial corporation's financial statements are prepared using u.s. gaap. these principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements are discussed in item 8, note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. in conjunction with that discussion, material implications of uncertainties associated with the methods, assumptions and estimates underlying the company's critical accounting policies are discussed below. the audit committee of the board of directors reviews the annual financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. these discussions cover the quality of earnings, review of reserves and accruals, reconsideration of the suitability of accounting principles, review of highly judgmental areas including critical accounting estimates, audit adjustments and such other inquiries as may be appropriate.
property casualty insurance loss and loss expense reserves we establish loss and loss expense reserves for our property casualty insurance business as balance sheet liabilities. unpaid loss and loss expenses are the estimated amounts necessary to pay for and settle all outstanding insured claims, including incurred but not reported (ibnr) claims. these reserves account for unpaid loss and loss expenses as of a financial statement date.
for some lines of business that we write, a considerable and uncertain amount of time can elapse between the occurrence, reporting and payment of insured claims. the amount we will actually have to pay for such claims also can be highly uncertain. this uncertainty, together with the size of our reserves, makes the loss and loss expense reserves our most significant estimate. gross loss and loss expense reserves were $5.035 billion at year-end 2016 compared with $4.660 billion at year-end 2015.
how reserves are established our field claims representatives establish case reserves when claims are reported to the company to provide for our unpaid loss and loss expense obligation associated with individual claims. field claims managers supervise and review all claims with case reserves less than $100,000. additionally, a headquarters supervisor and regional claims manager review all claims under $100,000 if litigation or a certain specialty claim is involved. all claims with case reserves of $100,000 or greater are reviewed and approved by an experienced headquarters supervisor and regional claims manager - up from a threshold amount of $35,000 for several years prior to 2015. upper-level headquarters claims managers also review case reserves of $175,000 or more - up from a threshold amount of $100,000 for several years prior to 2015.
our claims representatives base their case reserve estimates primarily upon case-by-case evaluations that consider:
•   type of claim involved
•   circumstances surrounding each claim
•   policy provisions pertaining to each claim
•   potential for subrogation or salvage recoverable
•   general insurance reserving practices case reserves of all sizes are subject to review on a 90-day cycle, or more frequently if new information about a loss becomes available. as part of the review process, we monitor industry trends, cost trends, relevant court cases, legislative activity and other current events in an effort to ascertain new or additional loss exposures.
we also establish ibnr reserves to provide for all unpaid loss and loss expenses not accounted for by case reserves:
•   for events designated as natural catastrophes, we calculate bulk reserves directly as a result of an estimated ibnr claim count and an estimated average claim amount for each event. once case reserves are established for a catastrophe event, we reduce the bulk reserves. our claims department management coordinates the assessment of these events and prepares the related bulk reserve estimates. such an assessment involves a comprehensive analysis of the nature of the event, of policyholder exposures within the cincinnati financial corporation - 2016 10-k - page 48
affected geographic area and of available claims intelligence. depending on the nature of the event, available claims intelligence could include surveys of field claims associates within the affected geographic area, feedback from a catastrophe claims team sent into the area, as well as data on claims reported as of the financial statement date. to determine whether an event is designated as a catastrophe, we generally use the catastrophe definition provided by property claims service (pcs), a division of insurance services office (iso). pcs defines a catastrophe as an event that causes countrywide damage of $25 million or more in insured property losses and affects a significant number of policyholders and insureds.
•   for asbestos and environmental claims, we calculate ibnr reserves by deriving an actuarially-based estimate of total unpaid loss and loss expenses. we then reduce the estimate by total case reserves. we discuss the reserve analysis that applies to asbestos and environmental reserves in liquidity and capital resources, asbestos and environmental reserves.
•   for loss expenses that pertain primarily to salaries and other costs related to our claims department associates, also referred to as adjusting and other expense or aoe, we calculate reserves based on an analysis of the relationship between paid losses and paid aoe. reserves for aoe are allocated to company, line of business and accident year based on a claim count algorithm. claim counts reported and used in the reserving process are primarily measured by insurance coverages that are triggered when a loss occurs and a reserve is established. coverages are defined as unique combinations of certain attributes such as line of business and cause of loss. claims that are opened and closed without payment are included in the reported claim counts. claim counts are presented on a direct basis only and do not reflect any assumed or ceded reinsurance. in 2009, we refined our claim count logic such that the definition of an open claim, a closed claim, and a claim that closes without payment was uniform amongst all of our systems, including legacy systems.
•   for all other claims and events, including reinsurance assumed, ibnr reserves are calculated as the difference between an actuarial estimate of the ultimate cost of total loss and loss expenses incurred reduced by the sum of total loss and loss expense payments and total case reserves estimated for individual claims. we discuss below the development of actuarially based estimates of the ultimate cost of total loss and loss expenses incurred.
our actuarial staff applies significant judgment in selecting models and estimating model parameters when preparing reserve analyses. unpaid loss and loss expenses are inherently uncertain as to timing and amount. uncertainties relating to model appropriateness, parameter estimates and actual loss and loss expense amounts are referred to as model, parameter and process uncertainty, respectively. our management and actuarial staff address these uncertainties in the reserving process in a variety of ways.
our actuarial staff bases its ibnr reserve estimates for these losses primarily on the indications of methods and models that analyze accident year data. accident year is the year in which an insured claim, loss or loss expense occurred. the specific methods and models that our actuaries have used for the past several years are:
•   paid and reported loss development methods
•   paid and reported loss bornhuetter-ferguson methods
•   individual and multiple probabilistic trend family models our actuarial staff uses diagnostics provided by stochastic reserving software to evaluate the appropriateness of the models and methods listed above. the software's diagnostics have indicated that the appropriateness of these models and methods for estimating ibnr reserves for our lines of business tends to depend on a line's tail. tail refers to the time interval between a typical claim's occurrence and its settlement. for our long-tail lines such as workers' compensation and commercial casualty, models from the probabilistic trend family tend to provide superior fits and to validate well compared with models underlying the loss development and bornhuetter-ferguson methods. the loss development and bornhuetter-ferguson methods, particularly the reported loss variations, tend to produce the more appropriate ibnr reserve estimates for our short-tail lines such as homeowner and commercial property. for our mid-tail lines such as personal and commercial auto liability, all models and methods provide useful insights.
cincinnati financial corporation - 2016 10-k - page 49
our actuarial staff also devotes significant time and effort to the estimation of model and method parameters. the loss development and bornhuetter-ferguson methods require the estimation of numerous loss development factors. the bornhuetter-ferguson methods also involve the estimation of numerous ultimate loss ratios by accident year. models from the probabilistic trend family require the estimation of development trends, calendar year inflation trends and exposure levels. consequently, our actuarial staff monitors a number of trends and measures to gain key business insights necessary for exercising appropriate judgment when estimating the parameters mentioned, such as:
•   company and industry pricing
•   company and industry exposure
•   company and industry loss frequency and severity
•   past large loss events such as hurricanes
•   company and industry premium
•   company in-force policy count these trends and measures also support the estimation of ultimate accident year loss ratios needed for applying the bornhuetter-ferguson methods and for assessing the reasonability of all ibnr reserve estimates computed. our actuarial staff reviews these trends and measures quarterly, updating parameters derived from them as necessary.
quarterly, our actuarial staff summarizes their reserve analysis by preparing an actuarial best estimate and a range of reasonable ibnr reserves intended to reflect the uncertainty of the estimate. an inter-departmental committee that includes our actuarial management team reviews the results of each quarterly reserve analysis. the committee establishes management's best estimate of ibnr reserves, which is the amount that is included in each period's financial statements. in addition to the information provided by actuarial staff, the committee also considers factors such as:
•   large loss activity and trends in large losses
•   new business activity
•   judicial decisions
•   general economic trends such as inflation
•   trends in litigiousness and legal expenses
•   product and underwriting changes
•   changes in claims practices the determination of management's best estimate, like the preparation of the reserve analysis that supports it, involves considerable judgment. changes in reserving data or the trends and factors that influence reserving data may signal fundamental shifts or may simply reflect single-period anomalies. even if a change reflects a fundamental shift, the full extent of the change may not become evident until years later. moreover, since our methods and models do not explicitly relate many of the factors we consider directly to reserve levels, we typically cannot quantify the precise impact of such factors on the adequacy of reserves prospectively or retrospectively.
due to the uncertainties described above, our ultimate loss experience could prove better or worse than our carried reserves reflect. to the extent that reserves are inadequate and increased, the amount of the increase is a charge in the period that the deficiency is recognized, raising our loss and loss expense ratio and reducing earnings. to the extent that reserves are redundant and released, the amount of the release is a credit in the period that the redundancy is recognized, reducing our loss and loss expense ratio and increasing earnings.
cincinnati financial corporation - 2016 10-k - page 50
key assumptions - loss reserving our actuarial staff makes a number of key assumptions when using their methods and models to derive ibnr reserve estimates. appropriate reliance on these key assumptions essentially entails determinations of the likelihood that statistically significant patterns in historical data may extend into the future. the four most significant of the key assumptions used by our actuarial staff and approved by management are:
•   emergence of loss and defense and cost containment expenses, also referred to as dcce, on an accident year basis. historical paid loss, reported loss and paid dcce data for the business lines we analyze contain patterns that reflect how unpaid losses, unreported losses and unpaid dcce as of a financial statement date will emerge in the future on an accident year basis. unless our actuarial staff or management identifies reasons or factors that invalidate the extension of historical patterns into the future, these patterns can be used to make projections necessary for estimating ibnr reserves. our actuaries significantly rely on this assumption in the application of all methods and models mentioned above.
•   calendar year inflation. for long-tail and mid-tail business lines, calendar year inflation trends for future paid losses and paid dcce do not vary significantly from a stable, long-term average. our actuaries base reserve estimates derived from probabilistic trend family models on this assumption.
•   exposure levels. historical earned premiums, when adjusted to reflect common levels of product pricing and loss cost inflation, can serve as a proxy for historical exposures. our actuaries require this assumption to estimate ultimate loss ratios and ultimate dcce ratios used by the bornhuetter-ferguson reserving methods. they may also use this assumption to establish exposure levels for recent accident years, characterized by "green" or immature data, when working with probabilistic trend family models.
•   claims having atypical emergence patterns. characteristics of certain subsets of claims, such as high frequency, high severity, or mass tort claims, have the potential to distort patterns contained in historical paid loss, reported loss and paid dcce data. when testing indicates this to be the case for a particular subset of claims, our actuaries segregate these claims from the data and analyze them separately. subsets of claims that could fall into this category include hurricane claims or claims for other weather events where total losses we incurred were very large, individual large claims and asbestos and environmental claims.
these key assumptions have not changed since 2005, when our actuarial staff began using probabilistic trend family models to estimate ibnr reserves.
paid losses, reported losses and paid dcce are subject to random as well as systematic influences. as a result, actual paid losses, reported losses and paid dcce are virtually certain to differ from projections. such differences are consistent with what specific models for our business lines predict and with the related patterns in the historical data used to develop these models. as a result, management does not closely monitor statistically insignificant differences between actual and projected data.
reserve estimate variability management believes that the standard error of a reserve estimate, a measure of the estimate's variability, provides the most appropriate measure of the estimate's sensitivity. the reserves we establish depend on the models we use and the related parameters we estimate in the course of conducting reserve analyses. however, the actual amount required to settle all outstanding insured claims, including ibnr claims, as of a financial statement date depends on stochastic, or random, elements as well as the systematic elements captured by our models and estimated model parameters. for the lines of business we write, process uncertainty - the inherent variability of loss and loss expense payments - typically contributes more to the imprecision of a reserve estimate than parameter uncertainty.
consequently, a sensitivity measure that ignores process uncertainty would provide an incomplete picture of the reserve estimate's sensitivity. since a reserve estimate's standard error accounts for both process and parameter uncertainty, it reflects the estimate's full sensitivity to a range of reasonably likely scenarios.
cincinnati financial corporation - 2016 10-k - page 51
the table below provides standard errors and reserve ranges by major property casualty lines of business and in total for net loss and loss expense reserves as well as the potential effects on our net income, assuming a 35 percent federal tax rate. standard errors and reserve ranges for assorted groupings of these lines of business cannot be computed by simply adding the standard errors and reserve ranges of the component lines of business, since such an approach would ignore the effects of product diversification. see liquidity and capital resources, property casualty loss and loss expense obligations and reserves, range of reasonable reserves, for more details on our total reserve range. while the table reflects our assessment of the most likely range within which each line's actual unpaid loss and loss expenses may fall, one or more lines' actual unpaid loss and loss expenses could nonetheless fall outside of the indicated ranges.

life policy and investment contract reserves we establish the reserves for traditional life insurance policies based on expected expenses, mortality, morbidity, withdrawal rates and investment yields, including a provision for uncertainty. once these assumptions are established, they generally are maintained throughout the lives of the contracts. we use both our own experience and industry experience adjusted for historical trends in arriving at our assumptions for expected mortality, morbidity and withdrawal rates. we use our own experience and historical trends for setting our assumptions for expected expenses. we base our assumptions for expected investment income on our own experience adjusted for current economic conditions.
we establish reserves for our universal life, deferred annuity and investment contracts equal to the cumulative account balances, which include premium deposits plus credited interest less charges and withdrawals. some of our universal life insurance policies contain no-lapse guarantee provisions. for these policies, we establish a reserve in addition to the account balance based on expected no-lapse guarantee benefits and expected policy assessments.
asset impairment our fixed-maturity and equity investment portfolios are our largest assets. the company's asset impairment committee continually monitors the holdings in these portfolios and all other assets for signs of other-than-temporary or permanent impairment. the committee monitors decreases in the fair value of invested assets; an accumulation of company costs in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct an asset; uncollectability of all receivable assets; or other factors such as bankruptcy, deterioration of creditworthiness, failure to pay interest or dividends; signs indicating that the receivable carrying amount may not be recoverable; and changes in legal factors or in the business climate.
the application of our impairment policy resulted in other-than-temporary impairment (otti) charges that reduced our income before income taxes by $2 million in 2016, $52 million in 2015 and $24 million in 2014. otti losses represent noncash charges to income and are reported as realized investment losses.
our internal investment portfolio managers monitor their assigned portfolios. if a security is valued below cost or amortized cost, the portfolio managers undertake additional reviews. such declines often occur in conjunction with events taking place in the overall economy and market, combined with events specific to the industry or operations of the issuing organization. managers review quantitative measurements such as a declining trend in fair value, the extent of the fair value decline and the length of time the value of the security has been depressed, as well as qualitative measures such as pending events, credit ratings and issuer liquidity. we are even more proactive when these declines in valuation are greater than might be anticipated when viewed in the context of overall economic and market conditions. we provide information about valuations of our invested assets in item 8, note 2 of the consolidated financial statements.
all securities valued below 100 percent of cost or amortized cost are reported to the asset impairment committee for evaluation. securities valued between 95 percent and 100 percent of cost or amortized cost are reviewed but not monitored separately by the committee. when evaluating for otti, the committee considers the company's intent and ability to retain a security for a period adequate to recover its cost.
securities that have previously been other-than-temporarily impaired are evaluated based on their adjusted cost or amortized cost and further written down if deemed appropriate. we provide detailed information about securities fair valued in a continuous loss position at year-end 2016 in item 7a, application of asset impairment policy.
impairment charges are recorded for other-than-temporary declines in value if fair value is below cost or amortized cost and, in the asset impairment committee's judgment, the fair value is not expected to be recouped within a designated recovery period. when determining otti charges for our fixed-maturity portfolio, management places significant emphasis on whether issuers of debt are current on contractual payments and whether future contractual amounts are likely to be paid. our invested asset impairment policy states that fixed maturities below their amortized cost that the company (1) intends to sell or (2) more likely than not will be required to sell before recovery of their amortized cost basis are deemed to be otti. the amortized cost of any such securities is reduced to fair value as the new cost basis, and a realized loss is recorded in the period in which it is recognized. when these two criteria are not met, and the company believes that full collection of interest and/or principal is not likely, we determine the net present value of future cash flows by using the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition as the discount rate and compare that amount with the amortized cost and fair value of cincinnati financial corporation - 2016 10-k - page 53
the security. the difference between the net present value of the expected future cash flows and amortized cost of the security is considered a credit loss and recognized as a realized loss in the period in which it occurred. the difference between the fair value and the net present value of the cash flows of the security, the noncredit loss, is recognized in other comprehensive income as an unrealized loss.
when determining otti charges for our equity portfolio, our invested asset impairment policy considers qualitative and quantitative factors, including facts and circumstances specific to individual securities, asset classes, the financial condition of the issuer, changes in dividend payment, the length of time fair value had been less than cost, the severity of the decline in fair value below cost, the volatility of the security and our ability and intent to hold each position until its forecasted recovery.
for each of our equity securities in an unrealized loss position at december 31, 2016, we applied the objective quantitative and qualitative criteria of our invested asset impairment policy for otti. based on the individual qualitative and quantitative factors, as discussed above, we evaluate and determine an expected recovery period for each security. a change in the condition of a security can warrant impairment before the expected recovery period. if the security has not recovered cost within the expected recovery period, the security is other-than-temporarily impaired. our long-term equity investment philosophy, emphasizing companies with strong indications of paying and growing dividends, combined with our strong statutory capital and surplus, liquidity and cash flow, provide us the ability to hold these investments through what we believe to be slightly longer recovery periods during times of historic levels of market volatility.
securities considered to have a temporary decline would be expected to recover their cost or amortized cost, which may be at maturity. under the same accounting treatment as fair value gains, temporary declines (changes in the fair value of these securities) are reflected in shareholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheets in accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci), net of tax, and have no impact on net income.

fair value measurements valuation of financial instruments accounting standards codification (asc) 820-10, fair value measurements and disclosures, defines fair value as the exit price or the amount that would be (1) received to sell an asset or (2) paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between marketplace participants at the measurement date. when determining an exit price, we must, whenever possible, rely upon observable market data.
we have categorized our financial instruments, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3). if the inputs used to measure the financial instruments fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest level that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument. while we consider pricing data from outside services, we ultimately determine whether the data or inputs used by these outside services are observable or unobservable.
financial assets and liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as described in item 8, note 3 of the consolidated financial statements.
level 1 and level 2 valuation techniques over 99 percent of the $15.419 billion of securities in our investment portfolio at year-end 2016, measured at fair value, are classified as level 1 or level 2. financial assets that fall within level 1 and level 2 are priced according to observable data from identical or similar securities that have traded in the marketplace. also within level 2 are securities that are valued by outside services or brokers where we have evaluated and verified the pricing methodology and determined that the inputs are observable.
level 3 valuation techniques at december 31, 2016, total level 3 assets were less than 1 percent of our investment portfolio measured at fair value. financial assets that fall within the level 3 hierarchy are valued based upon unobservable market inputs, normally because they are not actively traded on a public market. pricing for each level 3 security is based upon inputs that are market driven, including quotes from brokers or other external sources. we placed in the level 3 hierarchy securities for which we were unable to obtain the pricing methodology or we could not consider the price provided as binding. pricing for securities classified as level 3 could not be corroborated by similar securities priced using observable inputs.
management ultimately determined the pricing for each level 3 security that we considered to be the best exit price valuation. broker quotes are obtained for thinly traded securities that subsequently fall within the level 3 hierarchy. we have generally obtained and evaluated two nonbinding quotes from brokers; our investment professionals determine our best estimate of fair value.
employee benefit pension plan we have a defined benefit pension plan that was modified during 2008; refer to item 8, note 13 of the consolidated financial statements, for additional information. contributions and pension costs are developed from annual actuarial valuations. these valuations involve key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets and compensation increase rates, which are updated annually. any adjustments to these assumptions are based on considerations of current market conditions. therefore, changes in the related pension costs or credits may occur in the future due to changes in assumptions.
key assumptions used in developing the benefit obligation at year-end 2016 for our qualified plan were a 4.30 percent discount rate and rates of compensation increases ranging from 2.75 percent to 3.25 percent. to determine the discount rate, a theoretical settlement portfolio of high-quality, rated corporate bonds was chosen to provide payments approximately matching the plan's projected benefit payments. a single interest rate was determined, resulting in a discounted value of the plan's benefit payments that equates to the market value of the selected bonds. the discount rate is reflective of current market interest rate conditions and our plan's liability characteristics.
cincinnati financial corporation - 2016 10-k - page 55
key assumptions used in developing the 2016 net pension expense for our qualified plan were a 4.55 percent discount rate, a 7.25 percent expected return on plan assets and rates of compensation increases ranging from 2.75 percent to 3.25 percent.
in 2016, the net pension expense was $9 million. in 2017, we expect the net pension expense to be approximately $6 million.
holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5 percentage-point decrease in the discount rate would decrease our 2017 income before income taxes by $1 million. a 0.5 percentage-point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would decrease our 2017 income before income taxes by $1 million.
the fair value of the plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation by $6 million and were less than the accumulated benefit obligation by $15 million at year-end 2016 and 2015, respectively. the fair value of the plan assets were $25 million and $45 million less than the projected plan benefit obligation at year-end 2016 and at year-end 2015, respectively. market conditions and interest rates significantly affect future assets and liabilities of the pension plan. during the first quarter of 2017, we contributed $5 million to our qualified plan.
deferred policy acquisition costs we establish a deferred asset for expenses associated with successfully acquiring property casualty and life insurance policies, primarily commissions, premium taxes and underwriting costs. underlying assumptions are updated periodically to reflect actual experience, and we evaluate our deferred acquisition cost recoverability.
for property casualty insurance policies, deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the terms of the policies. these costs are principally agent commissions, premium taxes and certain underwriting costs related to successful contract acquisition, which are deferred and amortized into net income as premiums are earned. we assess recoverability of deferred acquisition costs at the segment level, consistent with the ways we acquire, service, manage and measure profitability. deferred acquisition costs track with the change in premiums.
for life insurance policies, acquisition costs are amortized into income either over the premium-paying period of the policies or the life of the policy, depending on the policy type. these costs are principally agent commissions and underwriting costs related to successful contract acquisition. we analyze our acquisition cost assumptions periodically to reflect actual experience; we evaluate our deferred acquisition cost for recoverability; and we regularly conduct reviews for potential premium deficiencies or loss recognition. changes in the amounts or timing of estimated future profits could result in adjustments to the accumulated amortization of these costs.

financial results consolidated financial results primarily reflect the results of our five reporting segments. these segments are defined based on financial information we use to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of assets.
•   commercial lines insurance
•   personal lines insurance
•   excess and surplus lines insurance
•   life insurance
•   investments we report as other the noninvestment operations of the parent company and its noninsurer subsidiary, cfc investment company, and the financial results of our reinsurance assumed operations.
we measure profit or loss for our commercial lines, personal lines and excess and surplus lines and life insurance segments based upon underwriting results (profit or loss), which represent net earned premium less loss and loss expenses and underwriting expenses on a pretax basis. we also evaluate results for our consolidated property casualty insurance operations. that is the total of our standard market segments (commercial lines and personal lines), our excess and surplus lines insurance segment and our reinsurance assumed operations. for analysis of our consolidated property casualty insurance results, it is important to include our reinsurance assumed operations earned premiums, loss and loss expenses and also underwriting expenses reported as other. underwriting results and segment pretax operating income are not substitutes for net income determined in accordance with gaap.
for our consolidated property casualty insurance operations as well as the insurance segments, statutory accounting data and ratios are key performance indicators that we use to assess business trends and to make comparisons to industry results, since gaap-based industry data generally is not as readily available.
investments held by the parent company and the investment portfolios for the insurance subsidiaries are managed and reported as the investments segment, separate from our underwriting business. net investment income and net realized investment gains and losses for our investment portfolios are discussed in the investments results.
the calculations of segment data are described in more detail in item 8, note 18, of the consolidated financial statements. the following sections provide analysis and discussion of results of operations for each of the five segments.

consolidated property casualty insurance results earned and net written premiums for our consolidated property casualty operations grew in 2016, reflecting average renewal price increases, a higher level of insured exposures and strategic initiatives for targeted growth. a key measure of property casualty profitability is underwriting profit or loss. our 2016 underwriting profit of $242 million was $144 million less than in 2015, driven by a $175 million unfavorable effect from a higher amount of natural catastrophe losses, mostly caused by severe weather. the benefits of higher pricing, and our ongoing initiatives to improve pricing precision and loss experience related to claims and loss control practices, were largely responsible for the remainder of the change in 2016 underwriting profit compared with 2015. that improvement is discussed further below and includes prior accident year loss experience before catastrophes during 2016 that was slightly less favorable than in 2015.
the table below highlights property casualty results, with analysis and discussion in the sections that follow. that analysis and discussion includes sections by segment.

performance highlights for consolidated property casualty operations include:
•   premiums - agency renewal written premiums rose $147 million in 2016 and were the primary contributor of growth in earned premiums and net written premiums that rose in each of our property casualty segments. the renewal premium increase was largely due to average renewal price increases and a higher level of insured exposures. price increases with enhanced precision continue to benefit operating results.
new business written premiums produced through agencies increased $19 million in 2016, compared with 2015. agents appointed during 2016 or 2015 produced a 2016 increase in standard lines new business of $38 million. growth initiatives also favorably affect growth in subsequent years, particularly as newer agency relationships mature over time.
cincinnati financial corporation - 2016 10-k - page 58
net written premiums increased $38 million in 2016 from expansion of reinsurance assumed operations, known as cincinnati resm. cincinnati re assumes risks through reinsurance treaties and in some cases cedes part of the risk and related premiums to one or more unaffiliated reinsurance companies through transactions known as retrocessions. in 2016, earned premiums for cincinnati re totaled $49 million.
other written premiums consist primarily of premiums ceded to reinsurers as part of our ceded reinsurance program and in total contributed $15 million more in 2016 to net written premiums than in 2015. a decrease in ceded premiums, other than cincinnati re premiums, contributed $1 million to net written premium growth in 2016, compared with 2015. other written premiums also included a more favorable adjustment for 2016, compared with 2015, for estimated direct written premiums of policies in effect but not yet processed in our commercial lines insurance segment. this written premium adjustment has an immaterial effect on earned premiums.

•   combined ratio - the 2016 combined ratio increased 3.7 percentage points compared with 2015, reflecting a 3.8 percentage-point increase in the ratio for natural catastrophe losses. the 2016 ratio for current accident year losses and loss expenses before catastrophes decreased by 0.6 percentage points, and reflects our belief that our loss experience is improving due to recent-year initiatives to improve pricing precision and claims and loss control practices. the remainder of the 2016 combined ratio increase included 0.4 percentage-points less benefit in the ratio for prior accident year losses and loss expenses before catastrophes. we further discuss ratios related to reserve development in the sections that follow the catastrophe losses incurred table below.
our statutory combined ratio was 94.5 percent in 2016 compared with 90.6 percent in 2015 and 95.1 percent in 2014. the estimated statutory combined ratio for the property casualty industry, with the industry's ratio excluding its mortgage and financial guaranty lines of business, was 100.7 percent in 2016, 98.3 percent in 2015 and 97.4 percent in 2014. the contribution of catastrophe losses to our statutory combined ratio was 7.5 percentage points in 2016, 3.7 percentage points in 2015 and 5.1 percentage points in 2014, compared with industry estimates of 4.9, 3.5 and 4.0 percentage points, respectively. components of the combined ratio are discussed below.
catastrophe loss trends are an important factor in assessing trends for overall underwriting results. our 10-year historical annual average contribution of catastrophe losses to the combined ratio was 6.2 percentage points at december 31, 2016. our five-year average was 6.1 percentage points.

consolidated property casualty insurance loss and loss expenses loss and loss expenses include both net paid losses and reserve changes for unpaid losses as well as the associated loss expenses. for all property casualty lines of business in aggregate, net loss and loss expense reserves at december 31, 2016, were $358 million higher than at year-end 2015, including $218 million for incurred but not reported (ibnr) reserves. the $358 million reserve increase raised year-end 2016 net loss and loss expense reserves by 8 percent, compared with a 5 percent increase in 2016 earned premiums.
for our commercial casualty line of business in 2016, we experienced a rising trend in paid losses and loss expenses that was more than we expected. as a result, we increased our actuarial best estimates of ultimate loss and loss expense ratios at the end of 2016, compared with year-end 2015. net loss and loss expense reserves at december 31, 2016, for our commercial casualty line of business was $132 million higher than at year-end 2015. the ibnr portion of the reserve increase was $103 million.
most of the incurred losses and loss expenses shown in the consolidated property casualty insurance results three-year highlights table are for the respective current accident years, with reserve development on prior accident years shown separately. since less than half of our consolidated property casualty current accident year incurred losses and loss expenses represents net paid amounts, the majority represents reserves for our estimate of ultimate losses and loss expenses. these reserves develop over time, and we re-estimate previously reported reserves as we learn more about the development of the related claims. the table below illustrates that development. for example, the 64.5 percent accident year 2015 loss and loss expense ratio reported as of december 31, 2015, developed favorably by 2.1 percentage points to 62.4 percent due to claims settling for less than previously estimated, or due to updated reserve estimates for unpaid claims, as of december 31, 2016. accident years 2015 and 2014 have both developed favorably, as indicated by the progression over time for the ratios in the table.

catastrophe loss trends, discussed above, accounted for some of the movement in current accident year loss and loss expense ratio for 2016, compared with 2015. catastrophe losses added 7.7 percentage points in 2016, 4.1 points in 2015 and 5.7 points in 2014 to the respective consolidated property casualty current accident year loss and loss expense ratios in the table above.
the 59.8 percent ratio for current accident year loss and loss expenses before catastrophe losses for 2016 decreased 0.6 percentage points compared with the 60.4 percent accident year 2015 ratio measured as of december 31, 2015. contributors to the decrease included favorable effects from initiatives, such as ones to improve pricing precision and loss experience related to claims and loss control practices, and were partially offset by more current accident year losses of $1 million or more per claim, shown in the table below.
reserve development on prior accident years continued to net to a favorable amount in 2016, and was primarily due to lower-than-anticipated loss emergence on known claims. we recognized $168 million of favorable development in 2016, compared with $184 million in 2015 and $98 million in 2014. of the $16 million decrease in 2016, compared with 2015, $43 million was attributable to our commercial casualty line of business. approximately 70 percent of our net favorable reserve development on prior accident years recognized during 2016 occurred in our commercial casualty, commercial property and workers' compensation lines of business. in 2015, our commercial casualty and workers' compensation lines of business were responsible for approximately 85 percent of the favorable reserve development. as discussed in liquidity and capital resources, property casualty loss and loss expense obligations and reserves, property casualty insurance development of estimated reserves by accident year, commercial casualty and workers' compensation are considered long-tail lines with the potential for revisions inherent in estimating reserves. favorable development recognized during 2014 was primarily from our commercial property and workers' compensation lines of business. development by accident year is further discussed in property casualty insurance development of estimated reserves by accident year.

in 2016, total large losses incurred decreased by $12 million, or 6 percent, net of reinsurance. the corresponding ratio decreased 0.5 percentage points. our analysis of large losses incurred indicated no unexpected concentration of these losses and reserve increases by geographic region, policy inception, agency or field marketing territory. we believe the inherent volatility of aggregate loss experience for our portfolio of larger policies is greater than that of our portfolio of smaller policies, and we continue to monitor the volatility in addition to general inflationary trends in loss costs.

consolidated property casualty commission expenses rose $27 million, or 3 percent, in 2016, with profit-sharing commissions for agencies decreasing by less than $1 million. commission expenses as a percent of earned premiums resulted in a ratio that decreased by 0.2 percentage-points compared with 2015, as earned premiums rose 5 percent. the 2016 ratio for other underwriting expenses was 0.3 percentage-points higher than 2015, reflecting an 8 percent increase in those expenses that outpaced growth in earned premiums. during 2016, we continued to carefully manage expenses while also making strategic investments that include enhancement of underwriting expertise, such as personal lines staff additions to support high net worth market expansion.

commission expenses include our profit-sharing commissions, which are primarily based on one-year and three-year profitability of an agency's business. the aggregate profit trend for agencies that earn these profit-based commissions can differ from the aggregate profit trend for all agencies reflected in our consolidated property casualty results.
salaries, benefits and payroll taxes for our associates account for approximately half of our property casualty other underwriting expenses. most of our associates either provide direct service to the property casualty portion of our agencies' businesses or provide support to those associates.

performance highlights for the commercial lines insurance segment include:
•   premiums - earned premiums and net written premiums rose in 2016, primarily due to a $76 million increase in renewal written premiums that continued to include a price increase for an average policy. new business written premiums in 2016 increased $7 million, or 2 percent, compared with 2015. the increase was driven by production from agencies appointed since the beginning of 2015, offsetting effects of a softening commercial insurance market.
•   combined ratio - the 2016 combined ratio increased 5.6 percentage points compared with 2015, including a 4.0 percentage-point increase in the ratio for natural catastrophe losses. the 2016 ratio for current accident year losses and loss expenses before catastrophes increased by 0.7 percentage points, including 1.4 points from more current accident year losses of $1 million or more per claim, shown in the table below. development on prior accident years' loss and loss expense reserves before catastrophes during 2016 was 0.7 percentage points less favorable than in 2015, including 1.9 points from re-estimates of ibnr reserves for losses and loss expenses.
our largest commercial line of business, commercial casualty, drove the ibnr component of the increase in the commercial lines segment ratio for loss and loss expenses from prior accident years before catastrophe losses. that higher estimate for ibnr reserves reflected paid loss trends emerging at levels higher than we previously expected. despite the reserve increase, our commercial casualty 2016 loss and loss expense ratio remained below 58 percent, indicating a healthy underwriting profit once underwriting expenses are considered.
as discussed in critical accounting estimates, property casualty insurance loss and loss expense reserves, stable historical paid loss patterns are a key assumption used to make projections necessary for estimating ibnr cincinnati financial corporation - 2016 10-k - page 64
reserves. during 2016, we observed paid losses or re-estimates of case reserves emerging at levels higher than expected for commercial casualty, including a large umbrella liability claim for accident year 2007 and a large general liability claim for accident year 2012. considering that new data at december 31, 2016, we estimated commercial casualty ibnr reserves for several older accident years at levels more likely to be adequate, compared with estimates at the end of 2015.
commercial auto, representing 19 percent of 2016 earned premiums for our commercial lines insurance segment, was the only major line of business in that segment with a 2016 total loss and loss expense ratio significantly higher than we desired. during 2016, our commercial auto policies experienced average renewal price percentage increases in the mid-single-digit range, which we believe will help improve future profitability. we also continued to improve premium rate classification and use of other rating variables in risk selection and pricing.
pricing precision and other initiatives to improve commercial lines underwriting profitability complement our business practices that continue to leverage the local presence of our field staff. field marketing representatives meet with local agencies to assess each risk, determine limits of insurance and establish appropriate terms and conditions. they continue to underwrite new business while field loss control, machinery and equipment and claims representatives continue to conduct on-site inspections. field claims representatives also assist underwriters by preparing full reports on their first-hand observations of risk quality.
our commercial lines statutory combined ratio was 93.9 percent in 2016, compared with 88.3 percent in 2015 and 94.3 percent in 2014. the estimated commercial lines combined ratio for the industry was 98.2 percent in 2016, 97.5 percent in 2015 and 97.1 percent in 2014. the industry's ratio excludes its mortgage and financial guaranty lines of business. the contribution of catastrophe losses to our commercial lines statutory combined ratio was 7.1 percentage points in 2016, 3.1 percentage points in 2015 and 4.3 percentage points in 2014, compared with industry estimates of 3.2, 2.1 and 2.4 percentage points, respectively.

we continue to refine our use of predictive analytics tools to improve pricing precision as we further segment commercial lines policies, emphasizing identification and retention of policies we believe have relatively stronger price adequacy. these tools better align individual insurance policy pricing to risk attributes, providing our underwriters with enhanced abilities to target profitability and to discuss pricing impacts with agency personnel. we also continue to leverage our local relationships with agents through the efforts of our teams that work closely with them. we believe our field focus is unique and has several advantages, including providing us with quality intelligence on local market conditions. we seek to maintain appropriate pricing discipline for both new and renewal business as management continues to emphasize the importance of our agencies and underwriters assessing account quality to make careful decisions on a case-by-case basis whether to write or renew a policy. premium rate credits may be used to retain renewals of quality business and to earn new business, but we do so selectively in order to avoid commercial accounts that we believe have insufficient profit margins.
our 3 percent increase in 2016 agency renewal written premiums included higher average pricing. we measure average changes in commercial lines renewal pricing as the rate of change in renewal premium for the new policy period compared with the premium for the expiring policy period, assuming no change in the level of insured exposures or policy coverage between those periods for respective policies. in 2016, our standard commercial lines policies averaged an estimated pricing change at a percentage in the low-single-digit range, slightly lower than in 2015 that was near the middle of that range, compared with near the high end of that range in 2014. our average commercial lines pricing change includes the flat pricing effect of certain coverages within package policies written for a three-year term that were in force but did not expire during the period being measured. therefore, the average cincinnati financial corporation - 2016 10-k - page 65
commercial lines pricing change we report reflects a blend of policies that did not expire and other policies that did expire during the measurement period.
for only those commercial lines policies that did expire and were then renewed during 2016, we estimate that the average price increase was near the high end of the low-single-digit range, compared with near the low end of the mid-single-digit range in 2015. during 2016, we continued to further segment our commercial lines policies, emphasizing identification and retention of policies we believed had relatively stronger price adequacy. conversely, we continued to seek more aggressive renewal terms and conditions on policies we believed had relatively weaker pricing, in turn retaining fewer of those policies. as a result, the average change in commercial lines renewal pricing tended to be lower than in 2015.
changes in the economy can affect insured exposures that directly relate to premium amounts charged for some policies. for commercial accounts, we usually calculate initial estimates for general liability premiums based on estimated sales or payroll volume, while we calculate workers' compensation premiums based on estimated payroll volume. a change in sales or payroll volume generally indicates a change in demand for a business's goods or services, as well as a change in its exposure to risk. policyholders who experience sales or payroll volume changes due to economic factors may also have other exposures requiring insurance, such as commercial auto or commercial property. premium levels for these other types of coverages generally are not linked directly to sales or payroll volumes.
premiums resulting from audits of actual sales or payrolls that confirmed or adjusted initial premium estimates have had a mixed effect on premium trends in recent years. on an earned premium basis for our commercial lines insurance segment, audits contributed negative $5 million to the $93 million earned premiums increase in 2016, $23 million to the $140 million earned premiums increase in 2015 and $5 million to the $220 million earned premiums increase in 2014. on a net written premium basis, audits contributed negative $1 million to the $97 million net written premiums increase in 2016, $20 million to the $103 million net written premiums increase in 2015 and $9 million to the $162 million net written premiums increase in 2014. these net written premium amounts are included with agency renewal written premiums in the commercial lines insurance premiums table above.
in 2016, our commercial lines new business premiums written by our agencies increased $7 million, or 2 percent, compared with 2015. new business premium volume in recent years has been significantly influenced by new agency appointments. agencies appointed since the beginning of 2015 produced commercial lines new business written premiums of $27 million, in aggregate, during 2016, up $17 million from what they produced during 2015. all other agencies contributed the remaining $345 million, down $10 million from the $355 million they produced in 2015.
for new business, our field associates are frequently in our agents' offices to: help judge the quality of each account; emphasize the cincinnati value proposition; call on sales prospects with those agents; carefully evaluate risk exposure; and provide their best quotes. some of our new business comes from accounts that are not new to the agent. we believe these seasoned accounts tend to be priced more accurately than business that is new to us and the agency. as we appoint new agencies who choose to move accounts to us, we report these accounts as new business to us.
other written premiums primarily consist of premiums that are ceded to reinsurers and that lower our net written premiums. an increase in ceded premiums contributed negative $1 million to net written premium growth for 2016, compared with 2015. other written premiums also included a more favorable adjustment for 2016, compared with 2015, for estimated direct written premiums of policies in effect but not yet processed in our commercial lines insurance segment. this written premium adjustment has an immaterial effect on earned premiums.
commercial lines insurance loss and loss expenses loss and loss expenses include both net paid losses and reserve changes for unpaid losses as well as the associated loss expenses. for our commercial casualty and commercial auto lines of business in 2016, we experienced a rising trend in paid losses and loss expenses that was more than we expected for certain accident years. as a result, we increased our actuarial best estimate of ultimate loss and loss expense ratios for several accident years within those lines at the end of 2016, compared with year-end 2015. net loss and loss expense reserves for commercial casualty at december 31, 2016, were $132 million, or 7 percent, higher than at year-end 2015. the ibnr portion of the reserve increase was $103 million. net loss and loss expense reserves for cincinnati financial corporation - 2016 10-k - page 66
commercial auto at december 31, 2016, were $77 million, or 16 percent, higher than at year-end 2015. the ibnr portion of the reserve increase was $34 million.
most of the incurred losses and loss expenses shown in the commercial lines insurance segment three-year highlights table are for the respective current accident years, with reserve development on prior accident years shown separately. since less than half of our commercial lines insurance segment current accident year incurred losses and loss expenses represents net paid amounts, the majority represents reserves for our estimate of ultimate losses and loss expenses. these reserves develop over time, and we re-estimate previously reported reserves as we learn more about the development of the related claims. the table below illustrates that development. for example, the 62.1 percent accident year 2015 loss and loss expense ratio reported as of december 31, 2015, developed favorably by 2.1 percentage points to 60.0 percent due to claims settling for less than previously estimated, or due to updates to reserve estimates for unpaid claims, as of december 31, 2015. accident years 2015 and 2014 for the commercial lines insurance segment have both developed favorably, as indicated by the progression over time of the ratios in the table.

catastrophe losses, as discussed in consolidated property casualty insurance results, explain some of the movement in current accident year loss and loss expense ratio for accident year 2016, compared with 2015. catastrophe losses added 7.3 percentage points in 2016, 3.5 points in 2015 and 4.8 points in 2014 to the respective commercial lines current accident year loss and loss expense ratios in the table above.
the 59.3 percent ratio for current accident year loss and loss expenses before catastrophe losses for 2016 increased 0.7 percentage points compared with the 58.6 percent accident year 2015 ratio measured as of december 31, 2015. higher commercial casualty ibnr reserves in 2016, noted above, contributed to the increase. large losses, described below, and the corresponding ratios for new losses above $1 million, contributed a 1.4 percentage-point increase to the 2016 ratio. those unfavorable contributions offset the favorable effects from initiatives, such as those to improve pricing precision and loss experience related to claims and loss control practices.
commercial lines reserve development on prior accident years of $129 million in 2016 continued to net to a favorable amount, but provided a smaller benefit than the $154 million recognized in 2015. the $25 million net decrease in 2016 included $43 million from our commercial casualty line of business. most of our commercial lines reserve net favorable development on prior accident years recognized during 2016 occurred in our commercial casualty, commercial property and workers' compensation lines of business, with workers' compensation representing 53 percent. favorable development recognized during 2015 was mostly from our commercial casualty and workers' compensation lines of business. favorable development recognized during 2014 was mostly from our workers' compensation line of business. development by accident year and other trends for commercial lines loss and loss expenses and the related ratios are further discussed in liquidity and capital resources, property casualty insurance development of estimated reserves by accident year.

in 2016, total large losses incurred increased by $24 million, or 14 percent, net of reinsurance. the corresponding ratio increased 0.7 percentage points. the 2016 increases on both a dollar and ratio basis were primarily due to higher amounts for our commercial casualty and commercial property lines of business. in 2015, total large losses incurred and the corresponding ratio was lower than it was in 2014, largely due to a lower amount of large losses for our commercial casualty and commercial property lines of business. our analysis indicated no unexpected concentration of these losses and reserve increases by geographic region, policy inception, agency or field marketing territory. we believe the inherent volatility of aggregate loss experience for our portfolio of larger policies is greater than that of our portfolio of smaller policies, and we continue to monitor the volatility in addition to general inflationary trends in loss costs.

commercial lines insurance outlook net written premiums for the commercial lines industry in 2017 are projected to essentially match 2016, with the industry statutory combined ratio estimated at approximately 101 percent, excluding its mortgage and financial guaranty lines of business. over the past several years, renewal and new business pricing has experienced significant competitive pressure, reinforcing the need for more pricing analytics and careful risk selection. while competition remains intense, industrywide commercial lines market pricing turned positive toward the end of 2011 and continued to firm for a period of time, according to several industry surveys. average renewal pricing for our commercial lines insurance segment generally followed a similar trend. according to a variety of reports that focus on the commercial lines market, commercial lines pricing is expected to continue to soften during 2017. despite challenging market conditions from strong competition, we believe we can manage our business and execute strategic initiatives to offset market pressures to some extent and profitably grow our commercial lines insurance segment.
we intend to keep marketing our products to a broad range of business classes with a package approach, while also continuing to improve our pricing precision and further segmenting among commercial lines policies. we intend to maintain our underwriting selectivity and carefully manage our rate levels as well as our programs that seek to accurately match exposures with appropriate premiums. we will continue to evaluate each risk individually and to make decisions about rates, the use of three-year commercial policies and other policy conditions on a case-by-case basis, even in lines and classes of business that are under competitive pressure. for our commercial auto line of business, we will continue to improve premium rate classification and use of other rating variables in risk selection and pricing. we believe that our initiatives to improve pricing precision and lower loss costs will continue to benefit commercial lines profitability during 2017, and that recent-year premium growth initiatives will continue to grow commercial lines premiums at a rate exceeding the industry.

reserve development performance highlights for the personal lines insurance segment include:
•   premiums - earned premiums and net written premiums continued to grow in 2016, primarily due to higher renewal written premiums that included price increases. renewal written premiums rose $58 million, or 6 percent, in 2016, compared with 2015.
•   combined ratio - the 2016 combined ratio rose 0.1 percentage points, compared with 2015, driven by a 3.2 percentage-point increase in the ratio for 2016 natural catastrophe losses. the total large loss ratio for losses of $1 million or more per claim, shown in the table below, decreased by 3.0 percentage points, largely due to lower losses for homeowner claims and personal umbrella claims related to auto accidents.
personal auto, representing 47 percent of 2016 earned premiums for our personal lines insurance segment, was the only major line of business in that segment with a 2016 total loss and loss expense ratio significantly higher than we desired. during 2016, our personal auto policies experienced premium rate increases averaging near the high end of the mid-single-digit range. we believe rate increase and other actions to improve pricing precision and reduce loss costs will improve future profitability. a similar approach was used to improve the total loss and loss expense ratio for our homeowner line of business to a satisfactory result in recent years.
we have increased our pricing precision and implemented numerous rate increases in recent years to improve our personal lines insurance segment results. in addition, we have made greater use of higher minimum loss deductibles and nonrenewed policies in select areas more prone to natural catastrophes. we have worked to improve our geographic diversification by expanding our personal lines operation to several states less prone to catastrophes.

our personal lines statutory combined ratio was 100.8 percent in 2016, up from 100.0 percent in 2015 and 99.1 percent in 2014. by comparison, the estimated industry personal lines combined ratio was 102.6 percent in 2016, 99.6 percent in 2015 and 98.8 percent in 2014. our concentration of business in areas affected by catastrophe events contributed to recent-year results that differed from the overall industry, an issue we are addressing in part through gradual geographic expansion. the contribution of catastrophe losses to our personal lines statutory combined ratio was 9.4 percentage points in 2016, 6.2 percentage points in 2015 and 7.8 percentage points in 2014, compared with industry estimates of 6.0, 4.8 and 5.5 percentage points, respectively.

personal lines insurance is a strategic component of our overall relationship with most of our agencies and is an important component of our agencies' relationships with their clients. we believe agents recommend our personal insurance products to their clients who seek to balance quality and price and who are attracted by our superior claims service and the benefits of our package approach. we also believe our continuing efforts to improve pricing precision are helping us attract and retain more of our agencies' preferred business, while also obtaining higher rates for more thinly priced business. our progress toward broader geographic diversification is reflected in part through premium growth trends. personal lines earned premiums in our five highest volume states increased in aggregate by 4 percent in 2016, while premiums for the remaining states that include our newer areas of operation increased 8 percent in aggregate.
the 6 percent increase in agency renewal written premiums in 2016 largely reflected various rate changes. we estimate that premium rates for our personal auto line of business increased at average percentages near the high end of the mid-single-digit range during 2016, with some individual policies experiencing lower or higher rate changes based on enhanced pricing precision enabled by predictive models. for our homeowner line of business, we estimate that rate increases during 2016 averaged in the mid-single-digit range. similar to our personal auto line of business, that average varied widely by state, and some individual policies experienced lower or higher rate changes based on pricing precision and current rate level indications that help determine appropriate premium rates.
personal lines new business written premiums grew $11 million, or 10 percent, during 2016, compared with 2015. that growth was driven by policies from high net worth clients of our agencies. personal lines new business written premiums from our high net worth policies totaled approximately $30 million for 2016, compared with $17 million for 2015. the decrease of approximately $2 million in new business written premiums for the part of our personal lines segment we sometimes refer to as middle market business is largely a reflection of a slight decline in policy retention due to significant premium rate increases for our personal auto policies during 2016. some of what we report as new business came from accounts that were not new to our agents. we believe our agents' seasoned accounts tend to be priced more accurately than business that may be less familiar to them.
personal lines new business written premiums grew significantly in 2015, compared with 2014. key factors contributing to that increase included an increase in larger-sized policy submissions due to underwriting appetite and pricing changes made to our existing personal lines products, increased visibility of underwriters and additional marketing efforts directed toward our agencies. in addition, in 2014 we began rolling out advanced quote discounts for home and auto and new home purchase discounts in most states, allowing us to compete more effectively in the comparative rater environment.
cincinnati financial corporation - 2016 10-k - page 71
other written premiums primarily consist of premiums that are ceded to reinsurers and that lower our net written premiums. ceded premiums for 2016 essentially matched 2015.
personal lines insurance loss and loss expenses loss and loss expenses include both net paid losses and reserve changes for unpaid losses as well as the associated loss expenses. for our personal auto line of business in 2016, we experienced a rising trend in paid losses and loss expenses that was more than we expected. as a result, we increased our actuarial best estimate of ultimate loss and loss expense ratios for that line at the end of 2016, compared with year-end 2015. net loss and loss expense reserves for our personal auto line of business at december 31, 2016, were $43 million, or 18 percent, higher than at year-end 2015. the ibnr portion of the reserve increase was $27 million.
most of the incurred losses and loss expenses shown in the personal lines insurance segment three-year highlights table are for the respective current accident years, with reserve development on prior accident years shown separately. since approximately two-thirds of our personal lines current accident year incurred losses and loss expenses represent net paid amounts, the remaining one-third represents reserves for our estimate of ultimate losses and loss expenses. these reserves develop over time, and we re-estimate previously reported reserves as we learn more about the development of the related claims. the table below illustrates that development. for example, the 71.4 percent accident year 2015 loss and loss expense ratio reported as of december 31, 2015, developed favorably by 1.0 percentage points to 70.4 percent due to claims settling for less than previously estimated, or due to updated reserve estimates for unpaid claims, as of december 31, 2016. accident year 2014 for the personal lines insurance segment developed favorably during 2015 and then developed unfavorably during 2016, as indicated by the progression over time for the ratios in the table. the unfavorable development during 2016 reflects the personal auto reserve addition described above.

catastrophe losses, as discussed in consolidated property casualty insurance results, explain much of the movement in current accident year loss and loss expense ratio for accident year 2016, compared with accident year 2015. catastrophe losses added 9.7 percentage points in 2016, 6.5 points in 2015 and 8.8 points in 2014 to the respective personal lines current accident year loss and loss expense ratios in the table above. personal lines catastrophe losses for 2016 resulted in a ratio near our 10.9 percent 10-year annual average for personal lines that included 22.8 percent for 2011. our personal lines catastrophe loss ratios for 2015 and 2014 were closer to our 8.7 percent 10-year annual average for the years 2001 through 2010. personal lines catastrophe losses also are inherently volatile, as discussed above and in consolidated property casualty insurance results.
the 63.0 percent ratio for current accident year loss and loss expenses before catastrophe losses for 2016 improved 1.9 percentage points compared with the 64.9 percent accident year 2015 ratio measured as of december 31, 2015. the improvement was largely due to a 2.4 percentage-point decrease in the ratio for current accident year losses of $1 million or more per claim, shown in the table below, that were primarily for homeowner claims and personal umbrella claims related to auto accidents.
personal lines loss and loss expense reserve development on prior accident years recognized in 2016 was favorable by $4 million, in aggregate, compared with an unfavorable net amount of $5 million in 2015. the 2016 net favorable reserve development included an unfavorable $18 million for our personal auto line of business, primarily for accident years 2013 through 2015, favorable $8 million for our homeowner line business and the remainder was favorable for our other personal line of business. in 2016, personal auto included a refinement to reserves for loss expenses, transferring approximately $10 million of reserves to various lines of business in our commercial lines segment. for losses only, our 2016 personal auto prior accident year net reserve development was unfavorable by $25 million. the 2015 unfavorable development was driven by $15 million of unfavorable development for our personal auto line of business, including $10 million for accident year 2013. our personal lines 2015 net unfavorable reserve development on prior accident years included $12 million of favorable development in our homeowner line of business. favorable development recognized during 2015 and 2014 was primarily from our cincinnati financial corporation - 2016 10-k - page 72

in 2016, personal lines total large losses incurred decreased by $33 million, or 73 percent, compared with 2015, net of reinsurance. the ratio for 2016 large losses as a percent of earned premiums decreased 3.0 percentage points. the 2016 decreases on both a dollar and ratio basis were largely due to lower amounts for homeowner claims and personal umbrella claims related to auto accidents. in 2015, total large losses increased, compared with 2014, primarily due to higher amounts of personal umbrella claims related to auto accidents. our analysis indicated no unexpected concentration of these losses and reserve increases by risk category, geographic region, policy inception, agency or field marketing territory. we believe the inherent volatility of aggregate loss experience for our portfolio of larger policies is greater than that of our portfolio of smaller policies, and we continue to monitor the volatility in addition to general inflationary trends in loss costs.

personal lines commission expense as a percent of earned premiums decreased in 2016 compared with 2015. the decrease reflected an unusually high 2015 ratio from changes in estimates related to allocations of deferred acquisition costs by segment. other underwriting expenses as a percent of earned premiums rose in 2016.
cincinnati financial corporation - 2016 10-k - page 73
the ratio increase was largely due to strategic investments that included enhancement of underwriting expertise, such as personal lines staff additions to support our high net worth market expansion.
personal lines insurance outlook a.m. best projections for 2017 indicate personal lines written premiums for the u.s. property casualty industry may grow approximately 3 percent, with an industry statutory combined ratio estimated at approximately 100 percent. we believe our growth rate will likely be higher than the industry projection for 2017, driven by our rate increases, stable policy retention rate, accelerated pace of new agency appointments in recent years and increased focus on the high net worth personal lines market. our high net worth initiative, along with various other actions to improve performance in our personal lines insurance segment, is discussed in greater detail in item 1, our business and our strategy, strategic initiatives and personal lines insurance results. our personal lines pricing trends need to exceed loss trends to improve personal lines profitability, thereby helping to achieve our corporate financial targets. we discuss our overall outlook for our property casualty insurance operations in the executive summary.

our excess and surplus lines insurance segment includes results of the cincinnati specialty underwriters insurance company and csu producer resources inc. performance highlights for this segment include:
•   premiums - earned premiums and net written premiums continued to grow during 2016. growth was driven by higher renewal written premiums that included average renewal price increases near the high end of the low-single-digit range. new business written premiums grew 2 percent in 2016, a slower rate than in 2015, as we continued to carefully underwrite each policy in a highly competitive market. within the excess and surplus lines market during 2016, some standard market carriers sought to increase market share by writing policies for larger risks formerly considered excess and surplus lines business.
•   combined ratio - the combined ratio improved 3.0 percentage points in 2016, primarily due to improved experience in current accident year losses and loss expenses before catastrophe losses that reflects careful underwriting.

the $13 million increase in 2016 renewal premiums reflected the opportunity to renew many policies for the first time as well as higher renewal pricing. average renewal price increases were near the high end of the low-single-digit range during 2016, while 2015 was near the low end of the mid-single-digit range. we measure average changes in excess and surplus lines renewal pricing as the rate of change in renewal premium for the new policy period compared with the premium for the expiring policy period, assuming no change in the level of insured exposures or policy coverage between those periods for respective policies.
new business written premiums and other written premiums in 2016 were similar to amounts in 2015. other written premiums are primarily premiums that are ceded to reinsurers and that lower our net written premiums.
excess and surplus lines loss and loss expenses loss and loss expenses include both net paid losses and reserve changes for unpaid losses, as well as the associated loss expenses. the majority of the total incurred losses and loss expenses shown above in the three-year highlights table are for the respective current accident years, with reserve development on prior accident years shown separately. since less than 20 percent of our 2016 excess and surplus lines current accident year incurred losses and loss expenses represents net paid amounts, a large majority represents reserves for our estimate of unpaid losses and loss expenses. these reserves develop over time, and we update our estimates of previously reported reserves as we learn more about the development of the related claims. the table below illustrates that development. for example, the 62.6 percent accident year 2015 loss and loss expense ratio reported as of december 31, 2015, developed favorably by 8.7 percentage points to 53.9 percent due to claims settling for less than previously estimated, or due to updated reserve estimates for unpaid claims, as of december 31, 2016. accident years 2015 and 2014 for this segment have both developed favorably, as indicated by the progression over time of the ratios in the table.

catastrophe losses, as discussed in consolidated property casualty insurance results, explain some of the movement in current accident year loss and loss expense ratio for accident year 2016, compared with 2015. catastrophe losses added 1.6 percentage points in 2016, 0.5 percentage points in 2015 and 1.8 percentage points in 2014, to the respective excess and surplus lines current accident year loss and loss expense ratios in the table above.
the 54.4 percent ratio for current accident year loss and loss expenses before catastrophe losses for 2016 decreased 7.7 percentage points compared with the 62.1 percent accident year 2015 ratio measured as of december 31, 2015. we also recognized significant favorable reserve development on prior accident years during both 2016 and 2015, with a ratio effect of approximately 20 percentage points for each year.
excess and surplus lines reserve development on prior accident years continued to net to a favorable amount in 2016 as $34 million was recognized, compared with $35 million in 2015. approximately two-thirds of the cincinnati financial corporation - 2016 10-k - page 76
2016 favorable development was for accident years 2015 and 2014 in aggregate, and was primarily due to lower-than-anticipated loss emergence on known claims.
we believe the loss and loss expense reserves for our excess and surplus lines business are adequate. the amount of outstanding reserves for our excess and surplus lines operation can be seen in a table in liquidity and capital resources, property casualty loss and loss expense obligations and reserves. one indication of how long it takes for most of the outstanding reserves to be settled is to measure outstanding reserves by accident year at different points in time. for accident year 2011 and all accident years prior to that, at december 31, 2011, we reported reserves for estimated unpaid losses and loss expenses of $77 million, net of reinsurance. at december 31, 2016, our estimate for the remaining unpaid losses and loss expenses that occurred in those accident years was approximately $4 million. the inherent uncertainty in estimating reserves is discussed in liquidity and capital resources, property casualty insurance loss and loss expense obligations and reserves. development trends by accident year are further discussed in property casualty insurance development of estimated reserves by accident year.

in 2016, total large losses incurred decreased by $4 million or 57 percent, net of reinsurance. the ratio for 2016 large losses as a percent of earned premiums decreased 2.7 percentage points. that ratio for 2015 trended in the opposite direction, due to 2015 total large losses increasing from 2014. our analysis indicated no unexpected concentration of these losses and reserve increases by risk category, geographic region, policy inception, agency or field marketing territory. we believe the inherent volatility of aggregate loss experience for our portfolio of larger policies is greater than that of our portfolio of smaller policies, and we continue to monitor the volatility in addition to general inflationary trends in loss costs.

excess and surplus lines commission expense as a percent of earned premiums for 2016 rose slightly from 2015, driven by an increase in profit-sharing commissions for agencies. other underwriting expenses increased in 2016, compared with 2015, largely due to strategic investments that include enhancement of underwriting expertise, such as upgrades to systems used in underwriting excess and surplus lines insurance policies. those ratio-increase effects offset the favorable ratio-decrease effects of higher earned premiums and ongoing expense management efforts. in 2015, the ratio declined, largely due to earned premiums rising faster than those expenses.
excess and surplus lines outlook the excess and surplus lines market is expected to see the magnitude of rate increases continue to decline on several classes of business due to increased capacity in the market. competition is expected to remain strong, especially on large accounts, due primarily to standard market insurance companies insuring businesses that previously were written by excess and surplus lines insurers. firming is expected to continue for specific classes of business where loss costs are exceeding rates, such as habitational for property coverages and general liability for liquor liability coverages.
industry reports suggest that there are opportunities for profitability and growth through greater use of technology. technology and data are also being used by excess and surplus lines insurance companies to identify new exposures in emerging businesses that need insurance protection or other value-added services.
our strategy of providing superior service is expected to continue to grow our excess and surplus lines insurance segment and to achieve profitability despite challenging market conditions. we intend to keep carefully selecting and pricing risks, providing prompt delivery of insurance quotes and policies and giving outstanding claims and loss control service from local field representatives who also handle the standard lines business for their assigned agencies. these local representatives are supported by headquarters underwriters and claims managers who specialize in excess and surplus lines.

performance highlights for the life insurance segment include:
•   revenues - earned premiums rose 9 percent for the year 2016, as shown in the table below that includes details by major line of business. our largest life insurance product line, term life insurance, rose 10 percent. net in-force policy face amounts rose 8 percent to $56.808 billion at year-end 2016 from $52.735 billion at year-end 2015 and $50.356 billion at year-end 2014.
•   profitability - the life insurance segment frequently reports only a small profit or loss because most of its investment income is included in the investments segment results. we include only investment income credited to contract holders (interest assumed in life insurance policy reserve calculations) in life insurance segment results. the segment reported a $1 million profit in 2016, following losses of $2 million in 2015 and $5 million in 2014. it has averaged a profit of less than $1 million over the past five years.
earned premiums rose $19 million in 2016, primarily due to growth in our term life insurance business, as shown in the table below. growth in 2015 was primarily due to term life insurance and universal life insurance.

we market term, whole and universal life products, fixed annuities and disability income products. in addition, we offer term, whole and universal life and disability insurance to employees at their worksite. these products provide our property casualty agency force with excellent cross-serving opportunities for both commercial and personal accounts.
over the past several years, we have worked to maintain a portfolio of simple, yet competitive, products primarily under the lifehorizons banner. our product development efforts emphasize death benefit protection and guarantees. distribution expansion within our property casualty insurance agencies remains a high priority. our 34 life field marketing representatives work in partnership with our 138 property casualty field marketing representatives. approximately 62 percent of our term and other life insurance product premiums were generated through our property casualty insurance agency relationships.
life insurance segment expenses consist principally of:
•   contract holders' benefits incurred, related to traditional life and interest-sensitive products, accounted for 76.4 percent of 2016 total benefits and expenses compared with 78.1 percent in 2015 and 78.4 percent in 2014. total contract holders' benefits increased as life policy reserves were higher in 2016, compared with 2015.
cincinnati financial corporation - 2016 10-k - page 79
net death claims decreased slightly from 2015, and were below our mortality projections while remaining within our range of pricing expectations.
•   underwriting expenses incurred, net of deferred acquisition costs, accounted for 23.6 percent of 2016 total benefits and expenses compared with 21.9 percent in 2015 and 21.6 percent in 2014. expenses in 2016 increased 15 percent, more than the 9 percent growth in earned premiums, primarily due to increased operating expenses related to premium growth and technology initiatives. in 2015, the percentage increase for expenses was slightly less than growth earned premiums.
life insurance segment profitability depends largely on premium levels, the adequacy of product pricing, underwriting skill and operating efficiencies. this segment's results include only investment interest credited to contract holders (interest assumed in life insurance policy reserve calculations). the remaining investment income is reported in the investments segment results. the life investment portfolio is managed to earn target spreads between earned investment rates on general account assets and rates credited to policyholders. we consider the value of assets under management and investment income for the life investment portfolio as key performance indicators for the life insurance segment.
we seek to maintain a competitive advantage with respect to benefits paid and reserve increases by consistently achieving better than average claims experience due to skilled underwriting. commissions paid by the life insurance operation are on par with industry averages.
we recognize that assets under management, capital appreciation and investment income are integral to evaluation of the success of the life insurance segment because of the long duration of life products. on a basis that includes investment income and realized gains or losses from life insurance-related invested assets, our life insurance subsidiary reported net income of $48 million in 2016, compared with net income of $41 million in 2015 and $39 million in 2014. the life insurance subsidiary portfolio had after-tax net realized investment gains of $5 million in 2016, compared with less than $1 million in 2015 and $3 million in 2014. realized investment gains and losses are discussed under investments results. we exclude most of our life insurance company investment income from investments segment results.
life insurance outlook we view the life insurance market as having significant pockets of growth opportunities. the traditional life distribution system is in a state of mild disruption. the combination of low interest rates, new technology and historic low ownership rates provide us with ample room to grow our term focused life insurance book through our independent agency model.
to further capitalize on this disruption, we recently piloted a new term product that allows our property casualty agents to quickly market and sell life insurance to our personal lines customers using accelerated underwriting through a predictive model. we expect to expand this initiative in 2017 and will continue to look for ways to improve the overall buying experience that we believe has contributed to the decline in ownership rates.
we are implementing statutory principle-based reserves for our core term product in 2017. we expect that action will begin to give us the ability to better manage the economic capital that is currently supporting the statutory reserves for our term book of business. while many term writers have used a variety of captive reinsurance solutions to deal with this statutory issue, we chose to carry the full reserve amounts on our balance sheet. that action has resulted in tremendous balance sheet strength and gaap equity growth. it also, however, has made it difficult to achieve high rates of return.
we are cautiously optimistic about the potential for corporate tax reform. should significant reform be implemented, we believe that our product pricing would be more favorably impacted than the industry.

the investments segment contributes investment income and realized gains and losses to results of operations. investments provide our primary source of pretax and after-tax profits.
•   investment income - pretax investment income grew $23 million, or 4 percent, in 2016, with increases from interest and dividends contributing nearly equal dollar amounts. dividend income reflected rising dividend rates and net purchases of equity securities from available funds. interest income also rose, as net purchases of fixed-maturity securities offset the continuing effects on bond yields of the low interest rate environment. pretax investment income also rose 4 percent in 2015, reflecting increases in both dividend income and interest income. average yields in the investment income table below are based on the average invested asset and cash amounts indicated in the table using fixed-maturity securities valued at amortized cost and all other securities at fair value.
•   realized investment gains and losses - we reported realized investment gains in all three years, largely due to investment sales that were discretionary in timing and amount. those gains were somewhat offset by otti charges.
we believe it is useful to analyze our overall investment performance by using total investment return over several years. total investment return considers changes in unrealized gains and losses, which are not included in net income, in addition to net investment income and realized investment gains and losses that are included in net income. changes in unrealized gains and losses shown in the table below include other invested assets. considering investment gains and losses, both realized and unrealized, over several years helps evaluate performance since gains and losses may experience typical variability during shorter periods of time.
the table below shows total return based on calculation assumptions that simplify cash flow timing that is commonly used in total return measures. this simplified calculation uses data shown in our consolidated financial statements or notes to those statements. added to invested asset amounts from our consolidated balance sheets are 50 percent of annual amounts pertaining to invested asset categories included in net cash used in investing activities from our consolidated statements of cash flows. the cash flow amounts are reduced by realized gains on investments, with the net result reduced by 50 percent to represent estimated new cash invested during each respective year. all new cash is assumed to be invested at the midpoint of the year.
total investment return of 8.5 percent in 2016 was significantly more than in 2015. the 2016 contribution from all three components of total investment return was higher than in 2015. investment income rose $23 million, realized investment gains rose $54 million and the invested assets net change in unrealized gains and losses rose $1.150 billion. the base component of the return calculation, annual average invested assets, was down less than 1 percent in 2016. for 2015 compared with 2014, total investment return declined 7.7 percentage points. the return contribution from the combination of 2015 investment income realized investment gains was nearly offset by a negative contribution from the net change in unrealized gains and losses. the base component of the return calculation, annual average invested assets, was up 7 percent in 2015.

investment income the primary drivers of investment income were:
•   interest income rose $12 million, or 3 percent, in 2016. the average fixed-maturity pretax yield declined by approximately 10 basis points but was offset by a larger average fixed-maturity portfolio that rose 5 percent on an amortized cost basis. interest income also increased 3 percent in 2015 when that yield declined by approximately 6 basis points while the portfolio rose 5 percent on an amortized cost basis.
•   dividend income rose $11 million, or 7 percent, in 2016, after rising 9 percent in 2015. increases in dividend payment rates for most of the holdings in our common stock portfolio during both 2016 and 2015, plus a slight net increase in funds invested in that portfolio for both years, drove the increases in dividend income.

in 2016, we continued to invest available cash flow in both fixed income and equity securities in a manner that we believe balances current income needs with longer-term invested asset growth goals. while our bond portfolio more than covers our insurance reserve liabilities, we believe our diversified common stock portfolio of mainly blue chip, dividend-paying companies represents one of our best investment opportunities for the long term. we position our portfolio with consideration to both the challenges presented by the current low interest rate environment and the risks presented by potential future inflation. as bonds in our generally laddered portfolio mature or are called over the near term, we will be challenged to replace their current yield. the table below summarizes pretax yield to amortized costs excluding any book value adjustments due to impairment for bonds in our fixed-maturity portfolio by various maturity periods.

we discussed our portfolio strategies in item 1, investments segment. we discuss risks related to our investment income and our fixed-maturity and equity investment portfolios in item 7a, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
net realized investment gains and losses net realized investment gains and losses are made up of gains or losses from the disposal of securities, changes in the valuation of embedded derivatives within certain convertible securities and otti charges from impaired securities. the factors we consider when evaluating impairments are discussed in critical accounting estimates, asset impairment.
investment gains or losses are recognized upon the sales of investments or as otherwise required under gaap. the timing of realized gains or losses from sales can have a material effect on results in any given period. however, such gains or losses usually have little, if any, effect on total shareholders' equity because most equity and fixed-maturity investments are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gain or loss included as a component of other comprehensive income.
as appropriate, we buy, hold or sell both fixed-maturity and equity securities on an ongoing basis to help achieve our portfolio objectives. we generally purchase fixed-maturity securities with the intention to hold until maturity. if they no longer meet our investment criteria, they are divested. sales of fixed-maturity securities are usually due to a change in credit fundamentals. pretax realized investment gains in the past three years largely were due to the sale of equity holdings.
net realized investment gains and losses totaling $124 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, included:
•   $99 million in net realized gains from equity security sales.
•   $25 million in net realized gains from fixed-maturity security sales and calls.
•   $2 million in other net realized gains.
•   $2 million in otti charges to write down four holdings of equity and fixed-maturity securities.
the $70 million net realized investment gains and losses in 2015 were primarily due to $103 million in net realized gains from equity security sales and $18 million from fixed-maturity security sales and calls, partially offset by $52 million of otti charges for six securities.
in 2014, the $133 million net realized investment gains and losses were primarily due to $136 million in net realized gains from equity security sales and $18 million from fixed-maturity security sales and calls, partially offset by $24 million of otti charges for six securities.

investments outlook despite a rise in interest rates near the end of 2016, yields remain below both long-term market averages in general and our embedded portfolio yield specifically. for at least the near term, this is likely to continue to exert pressure on investment income growth.
we continue to focus on portfolio strategies to balance near-term income generation and long-term book value growth. in 2017, we expect to continue to allocate a portion of cash available for investment to equity securities, taking into consideration corporate liquidity and income requirements, as well as insurance department regulations and rating agency comments. we discuss our portfolio strategies in item 1, our segments, investments segment.
we believe that a reversal of the slow but steady improvement in economic conditions could heighten the risk of renewed pressure on securities markets, which could lead to additional otti charges. our asset impairment committee continues to monitor the investment portfolio. the current asset impairment policy is described in critical accounting estimates, asset impairment.

other total revenues in 2016 for our other operations increased, compared with 2015, primarily due to earned premiums from our cincinnati re reinsurance assumed operations that began in 2015. other also includes noninvestment operations of the parent company and its commercial leasing and financial services subsidiary, cfc investment company. total expenses for other also increased in 2016, primarily due to losses and loss expenses and underwriting expenses from our cincinnati re operations.
other loss in the table below represents losses before income taxes. for each year shown, other loss was largely driven by interest expense from debt of the parent company. the net result of cincinnati re was an underwriting profit of approximately $8 million in 2016 and approximately $1 million in 2015.

taxes we had $221 million of income tax expense in 2016 compared with $247 million in 2015 and $196 million in 2014. our corporate effective tax rate for 2016 was 27.2 percent compared with 28.0 percent in 2015 and 27.2 percent in 2014.
the change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to changes in pretax income from underwriting results and realized investment gains and losses, with immaterial changes in the amount of permanent book-tax differences.
historically, we have pursued a strategy of investing some portion of cash flow in tax-advantaged fixed-maturity and equity securities to minimize our overall tax liability and maximize after-tax earnings. see item 1, our segments, tax-exempt fixed maturities, for further discussion on municipal bond purchases in our fixed-maturity investment portfolio. for our property casualty insurance subsidiaries, approximately 85 percent of interest from tax-advantaged fixed-maturity investments and approximately 60 percent of dividends from qualified equities are exempt from federal tax after applying proration from the 1986 tax reform act. our noninsurance companies own an immaterial amount of tax-advantaged fixed-maturity investments. for our noninsurance companies, the dividend received deduction exempts 70 percent of dividends from qualified equities. our life insurance company does not own tax-advantaged, fixed maturity investments or equities subject to the dividend received deduction. our effective tax rate reconciliation is found in item 8, note 11 of the consolidated financial statements.

liquidity and capital resources we seek to maintain prudent levels of liquidity and financial strength for the protection of our policyholders, creditors and shareholders. we manage liquidity at two levels to meet the short- and long-term cash requirements of business obligations and growth needs. the first is the liquidity of the parent company. the second is the liquidity of our insurance subsidiary. management of liquidity at both levels is essential because each has different funding needs and sources, and each is subject to certain regulatory guidelines and requirements.
parent company liquidity at december 31, 2016, the parent company had $2.133 billion in cash and marketable securities, providing strong liquidity to fund cash outflows, as needed. the payment of dividends to shareholders is largely based upon receiving subsidiary dividends. alternatively, we could sell investments or use our line of credit to support the dividend payment.
the parent company's primary sources of cash inflows are dividends from our insurance subsidiary, investment income and sale proceeds from investments. the parent company's cash outflows are primarily interest and principal payments on long- and short-term debt, dividends to shareholders, common stock repurchases and general operating expenses. the table below shows a summary, by the direct cash flow method, of the major sources and uses of cash flow of the parent company.

dividends received from the subsidiary in 2016 were $28 million more than 2015, supported by strong property casualty insurance subsidiary net cash flow from operating activities. we expect 2017 parent company sources of cash flows to be similar to 2016. the majority of expenditures for the parent company have been consistent during the last three years, and we expect future expenditures to remain fairly stable. share repurchases are discretionary, depending on cash availability and capital management decisions.
insurance subsidiary liquidity the parent company's insurance subsidiary is largely the operations of the property casualty segments. the primary sources of cash inflows are collection of premiums, investment income, maturity of fixed-income securities and sale proceeds from investments. property casualty insurance premiums generally are received before losses are paid under the policies purchased with those premiums. cash outflows are primarily loss and loss expenses, commissions, salaries, taxes, operating expenses and investment purchases. over the three-year period ended december 31, 2016, premium receipts and investment income have been more than sufficient to pay claims and operating expenses. excess cash flows were partially used to pay dividends to the parent company. we are not aware of any known trends that would materially change historical cash flow results other than fluctuations in catastrophe claims and other large losses either individually or in aggregate.

the table below shows a summary of operating cash flow for property casualty insurance (direct method). historically, annual variation in operating cash flow has been largely related to changes in amounts of catastrophe losses.

other sources of liquidity cash in excess of operating requirements is invested in fixed-maturity and equity securities. cash generated from investment income provides an important investment contribution to cash flow and liquidity. the sale of investments could provide an additional source of liquidity at either the parent company or insurance subsidiary level, if required. in addition to possible sales of investments, proceeds of call or maturities of fixed-maturity securities also can provide liquidity. during the five-year period beginning in 2017, fair value of $3.604 billion, or 35.7 percent, of our fixed-maturity portfolio is scheduled to mature. at year-end 2016, total unrealized gains in the investment portfolio, before deferred income taxes, were $2.625 billion. liquidity sourced from our investment portfolio is not materially at risk from european-based securities. at the end of 2016 this totaled $314 million on a fair value basis, or 2.0 percent of our total investments. we own no european sovereign debt. our european-based securities are summarized by country in item 7a, qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk.
financial resources of the parent company also could be made available to our insurance subsidiaries, if circumstances required. this flexibility would include our ability to access the capital markets and short-term bank borrowings. we generally have minimized our reliance on debt financing although we may use the line of credit to fund short-term cash needs.
long-term debt we provide details of our three long-term notes in item 8, note 8 of the consolidated financial statements. none of the notes are encumbered by rating triggers. the total principal amount of our long-term debt at december 31, 2016, was $793 million and included:
•   $28 million aggregate principal amount of 6.900% senior debentures due 2028.
•   $391 million aggregate principal amount of 6.920% senior debentures due 2028.
•   $374 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% senior debentures due 2034.
the company's senior debt is rated investment grade by independent rating firms. none of the four rating agencies made changes to our debt ratings in 2016. our debt ratings at february 22, 2017, were: a- from a.m. best, a from fitch ratings, a3 from moody's investors service and bbb+ from standard & poor's.
short-term debt at december 31, 2016, we had a $225 million line of credit with commercial banks, with $20 million borrowed. that line of credit had a $35 million balance at december 31, 2015. during 2016, we repaid $15 million as part of routine cash management. access to this line of credit requires compliance with various covenants, including maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth and not exceeding a 30 percent debt-to-total capital ratio, as defined by the agreement. at december 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.0 billion in net worth compared with our covenant net worth requirement. we are considerably within compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement, and believe we will remain in compliance. the credit agreement provides alternative interest charges based on the type of borrowing and our debt rating. the interest rate charged is adjusted libor plus an applicable margin.
cincinnati financial corporation - 2016 10-k - page 89
the $225 million unsecured revolving line of credit is administered by pnc bank, n.a., a subsidiary of the pnc financial services group inc. (nyse:pnc). the agreement was established in 2012, extended for two years in 2014, and will expire in may 2019. our subsidiary cfc investment company also is a borrower under this line of credit. pnc bank is the lead participant bookrunner with a $65 million share. fifth third bancorp (nasdaq:fitb) is the syndication agent with a $65 million share. u.s. bancorp (nyse:usb), bb&t corp (nyse:bbt) and huntington bancshares, inc. (nasdaq:hban) each provide $25 million of capacity, and northern trust corporation (nasdaq:ntrs), provides $20 million of capacity.
capital resources capital resources consisting of shareholders' equity and total debt represent our overall financial strength to support current obligations and growth in our insurance businesses. at december 31, 2016, we had total capital of $7.867 billion. shareholders' equity was $7.060 billion, an increase of $633 million, or 10 percent, from the prior year. our total debt was $807 million, down $14 million from a year ago. we seek to maintain a solid financial position and provide capital flexibility by keeping our ratio of debt to total capital moderate. we target a ratio below 20 percent. at year-end 2016, the ratio was 10.3 percent, compared with 11.3 percent at year-end 2015.
at the discretion of the board of directors, the company can return capital directly to shareholders as discussed below.
•   dividends to shareholders -the ability of our company to continue paying cash dividends is subject to factors the board of directors deem relevant. while the board and management believe there is merit to sustaining the company's long record of dividend increases, our first priority is the company's financial strength. over the past 10 years, the company has paid an average of 66 percent of net income as dividends. through 2016, the board had increased our cash dividend for 56 consecutive years. the board decision in january 2017 to increase the dividend demonstrated confidence in the company's strong capital, liquidity, financial flexibility and initiatives to grow earnings.
•   common stock repurchase - generally, our board believes that share repurchases can help fulfill our commitment to enhancing shareholder value. consequently, the board has authorized the repurchase of outstanding shares, giving management discretion to purchase shares at reasonable prices in light of circumstances at the time of purchase. our approach since mid-2008 has been to hold capital adequate to support future growth of our insurance operations and repurchase a minimal amount of shares. those repurchases were intended to partially offset the issuance of shares through equity compensation plans, primarily due to vesting of service-based restricted stock units of equity awards granted in the past. our corporate code of conduct restricts repurchases during certain time periods. the details of the repurchase authorizations and activity are described in item 5, market for the registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities.

obligations we pay obligations to customers, suppliers and associates in the normal course of our business operations. some are contractual obligations that define the amount, circumstances and/or timing of payments. we have other commitments for business expenditures; however, the amount, circumstances and/or timing of our other commitments are not dictated by contractual arrangements.
contractual obligations at december 31, 2016, we estimated our future contractual obligations as follows:

other commitments at december 31, 2016, we believe our most significant other commitments were:
•   commissions - we expect commission payments to generally track with written premiums.
•   other operating expenses - many of our operating expenses are not contractual obligations but reflect the ongoing expenses of our business. for example, we anticipate capitalizing development costs for approximately $6 million in spending for key technology initiatives in 2017, compared with actual capitalization totaling $8 million in 2016 and $6 million in 2015. these activities are conducted at our discretion, and we have no material contractual obligations for activities planned as part of these projects.
•   other invested assets - we may invest up to $27 million in private equity investments over the next four years.
liquidity and capital resources outlook at december 31, 2016, we had $777 million in cash and cash equivalents. during 2017, our insurance subsidiary can declare $469 million in dividends to our parent company without regulatory approval. that strong liquidity and our consistent cash flows give us the flexibility to meet current obligations and commitments while building value by prudently investing where we see potential for both current income and long-term return. our cash provides adequate financial cushion when short-term operating results do not meet our objectives.
a long-term perspective governs our liquidity and capital resources decisions, with the goal of benefiting our policyholders, agents, shareholders and associates over time. our underwriting philosophy and initiatives can drive performance to achieve our underwriting profitability target of a gaap combined ratio over any five-year period that consistently averages within the range of 95 percent to 100 percent. our gaap combined ratio averaged 94.3 percent over the five-year period 2012 through 2016, resulting in strong underwriting profits.
in any year, we consider the most likely source of pressure on liquidity would be an unusually high level of catastrophe loss payments within a short period of time. there could be additional obligations for our insurance operations due to increasing severity or frequency of noncatastrophe claims. to address the risk of unusually large insurance loss obligations including catastrophe events, we maintain property casualty reinsurance contracts with highly rated reinsurers, as discussed under 2017 reinsurance ceded programs. we also monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers because their insolvency could jeopardize a portion of our $545 million reinsurance recoverable asset at december 31, 2016. parent-company liquidity could also be constrained by ohio regulatory requirements that restrict the dividends insurance subsidiaries can pay.
cincinnati financial corporation - 2016 10-k - page 91
economic weakness also has the potential to affect our liquidity and capital resources in a number of different ways, including delinquent payments from agencies, defaults on interest payments by fixed-maturity holdings in our portfolio, dividend reductions by holdings in our equity portfolio or declines in the market value of holdings in our portfolio.
off-balance-sheet arrangements we do not use any special-purpose financing vehicles or have any undisclosed off-balance-sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in applicable sec rules) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on the company's financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

property casualty loss and loss expense obligations and reserves our estimate of future gross property casualty loss and loss expense payments of $5.035 billion is lower than loss and loss expense reserves of $5.085 billion reported on our balance sheet at december 31, 2016. the $50 million difference is due to certain life and health loss reserves. reserving practices are discussed in critical accounting estimates, property casualty insurance loss and loss expense reserves.
for the business lines in the commercial and personal lines insurance segments, and in total for the excess and surplus lines insurance segment, the following table details gross reserves among case, ibnr and loss expense reserves, net of salvage and subrogation. the $375 million increase in total gross reserves was primarily due to a $150 million increase in case loss reserves and a $187 million increase in ibnr loss reserves. total gross reserves for our commercial casualty line of business rose $136 million, for our commercial auto line of business they rose $78 million, for our commercial property line of business they rose $77 million and for our personal auto line of business they rose $45 million.

asbestos and environmental loss and loss expense reserves we carried $85 million of net loss and loss expense reserves for asbestos and environmental claims and $45 million of reserves for mold claims at year-end 2016, compared with $84 million and $45 million, respectively, for such claims at year-end 2015. the asbestos and environmental claims amounts for each respective year constituted 1.8 percent and 1.9 percent of total net loss and loss expense reserves at these year-end dates.
we believe our exposure to asbestos and environmental claims is limited, largely because our reinsurance retention was $500,000 or below prior to 1987. we also were predominantly a personal lines company in the 1960s and 1970s, when asbestos and pollution exclusions were not widely used by commercial lines insurers. during the 1980s and early 1990s, commercial lines grew as a percentage of our overall business and our exposure to asbestos and environmental claims grew accordingly. over that period, we endorsed to or included in most policies an asbestos and environmental exclusion.
additionally, since 2002, we have revised policy terms where permitted by state regulation to limit our exposure to mold claims prospectively and further reduce our exposure to other environmental claims generally. finally, we have not engaged in any mergers or acquisitions through which such a liability could have been assumed. we continue to monitor our claims for evidence of material exposure to other mass tort classes such as silicosis, but we have found no such credible evidence to date.
reserving data for asbestos and environmental claims has characteristics that limit the usefulness of the methods and models used to analyze loss and loss expense reserves for other claims. specifically, asbestos and environmental loss and loss expenses for different accident years do not emerge independently of one another as loss development and bornhuetter-ferguson methods assume. in addition, asbestos and environmental loss and loss expense data available to date did not reflect a well-defined tail, greatly complicating the identification of an appropriate probabilistic trend family model. at year-end 2016, we used a weighted average of a paid survival ratio method and report year method to estimate reserves for ibnr asbestos and environmental claims. our exposure to such claims is limited; we believe a weighted average of both methods produces a sufficient level of reserves.
gross property casualty loss and loss expense payments while we believe that historical performance of property casualty and life loss payment patterns is a reasonable source for projecting future claim payments, there is inherent uncertainty in this estimate of contractual obligations. we believe that we could meet our obligations under a significant and unexpected change in the timing of these payments because of the liquidity of our invested assets, strong financial position and access to lines of credit.
our estimates of gross property casualty loss and loss expense payments do not include reinsurance receivables or ceded losses. as discussed in 2017 reinsurance ceded programs, we purchase reinsurance to mitigate our property casualty risk exposure. ceded property casualty reinsurance unpaid receivables of $298 million at year-end 2016 are an offset to our gross property casualty loss and loss expense obligations. our reinsurance program mitigates the liquidity risk of a single large loss or an unexpected rise in claim severity or frequency due to a catastrophic event. reinsurance does not relieve us of our obligation to pay covered claims. the financial strength of our reinsurers is important because our ability to recover losses under our reinsurance agreements depends on the financial viability of the reinsurers.
we direct our associates and agencies to settle claims and pay losses as quickly as is practical, and we made $2.503 billion of net claim payments during 2016. at year-end 2016, total net property casualty reserves of $4.738 billion reflected $2.331 billion in unpaid amounts on reported claims (case reserves), $1.011 billion in loss expense reserves and $1.396 billion in estimates of claims that were incurred but had not yet been reported (ibnr). the specific amounts and timing of obligations related to case reserves and associated loss expenses are not set contractually. the amounts and timing of obligations for ibnr claims and related loss expenses are unknown. we discuss our methods of establishing loss and loss expense reserves and our belief that reserves are adequate in critical accounting estimates, property casualty insurance loss and loss expense reserves.

the historical pattern of using premium receipts for the payment of loss and loss expenses has enabled us to extend slightly the maturities of our investment portfolio beyond the estimated settlement date of the loss reserves. the effective duration of our consolidated property casualty fixed-maturity portfolio was 5.0 years at year-end 2016. by contrast, the duration of our loss and loss expense reserves was approximately 4.1 years. we believe this difference in duration does not affect our ability to meet current obligations because cash flow from operations is sufficient to meet these obligations. in addition, investment holdings could be sold, if necessary, to meet higher than anticipated loss and loss expenses.
range of reasonable reserves the company established a reasonably likely range for net loss and loss expense reserves of $4.449 billion to $4.894 billion at year-end 2016, with the company carrying net reserves of $4.738 billion. the likely range was $4.125 billion to $4.507 billion at year-end 2015, with the company carrying net reserves of $4.379 billion. our loss and loss expense reserves are not discounted for the time-value of money, but we have reduced the reserves by an estimate of the amount of salvage and subrogation payments we expect to recover.
the low point of each year's range corresponds to approximately one standard error below each year's mean reserve estimate, while the high point corresponds to approximately one standard error above each year's mean reserve estimate. we discussed management's reasons for basing reasonably likely reserve ranges on standard errors in critical accounting estimates, reserve estimate variability.
the ranges reflect our assessment of the most likely unpaid loss and loss expenses at year-end 2016 and 2015. however, actual unpaid loss and loss expenses could nonetheless fall outside of the indicated ranges.
management's best estimate of total loss and loss expense reserves as of year-end 2016 and 2015 was consistent with the corresponding actuarial best estimate.
development of reserves for loss and loss expenses we reconcile the beginning and ending balances of our reserves for loss and loss expenses at december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, in item 8, note 4 of the consolidated financial statements. the reconciliation of our year-end 2015 reserve balance to net incurred losses one year later recognized $168 million of favorable reserve development.
the table below shows the development of estimated reserves for loss and loss expenses for the past 10 years.
•   section a shows our total property casualty loss and loss expense reserves recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated calendar years on a gross and net basis. those reserves represent the estimated amount of unpaid loss and loss expenses for claims arising in the indicated calendar year and all prior accident years at the balance sheet date, including losses that were incurred but not yet reported to the company.
•   section b shows the cumulative net amount paid with respect to the previously recorded reserve as of the end of each succeeding year. for example, as of december 31, 2016, we paid $2.556 billion of loss and loss expenses in calendar years 2007 through 2016 for losses that occurred in accident years 2006 and prior. an estimated $341 million of losses remained unpaid as of year-end 2016 (net re-estimated reserves of $2.897 billion from section c less cumulative net paid loss and loss expenses of $2.556 billion).
•   section c shows the re-estimated amount of the previously reported reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. the estimate is increased or decreased as we learn more about the development of the related claims.
•   section d, cumulative net reserve development, represents the aggregate change in the estimates for all years subsequent to the year the reserves were initially established. for example, reserves established at december 31, 2006, had developed favorably by $459 million over 10 years, net of reinsurance, which was reflected in income over the 10 years. the table shows favorable reserve development as a negative number. favorable reserve development on prior accident years, which represents a negative expense, is favorable to income. the "one year later" line in the table shows the effects on income before income taxes in 2016, 2015 and 2014 of changes in estimates of the reserves for loss and loss expenses for all accident years. the effect was favorable to pretax income for those three years by $168 million, $184 million, and $98 million, respectively.

in evaluating the development of our estimated reserves for loss and loss expenses for the past 10 years, note that each amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods. for example, payments or reserve adjustments related to losses settled in 2016 but incurred in 2010 are included in the cumulative deficiency or redundancy amount for 2010 and each subsequent year. in addition, this table presents calendar year data, not accident or policy year development data, which readers may be more accustomed to analyzing. conditions and trends that affected development of reserves in the past may not necessarily occur in the future. accordingly, it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future reserve development based on this data.
differences between the property casualty reserves reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets (prepared in accordance with gaap) and those same reserves reported in the annual statements (filed with state insurance departments in accordance with statutory accounting practices - sap), relate principally to the reporting of reinsurance recoverables, which are recognized as receivables for gaap and as an offset to reserves for sap.

overall favorable development for consolidated property casualty reserves of $168 million in 2016 illustrated the potential for revisions inherent in estimating reserves, especially for long-tail lines such as commercial casualty and workers' compensation. as noted in critical accounting estimates, key assumptions loss reserving, our models predict that actual loss and loss expense emergence will differ from projections, and we do not attempt to monitor or identify such normal variations. the table in property casualty loss and loss expense obligations and reserves shows reserves by segment and lines of business and the components of gross reserves among case, ibnr and loss expense reserves.

favorable reserve development of $69 million for our workers' compensation line accounted for approximately 53 percent of our commercial lines insurance segment net total in 2016, while favorable reserve development of $20 million for our commercial casualty line of business accounted for approximately 16 percent. our commercial auto line of business experienced $31 million of unfavorable reserve development on prior accident years recorded during 2016, and that 2016 measure for our personal auto line of business was also unfavorable at $18 million. drivers of significant reserve development typically reflect loss emergence on known claims that was more favorable or less favorable than previously anticipated for various lines of business and are discussed below.
•   commercial casualty - during 2016, we experienced favorable development on prior accident years in total for this line of business. however, results varied between component coverages and by accident year within coverage. for example, our commercial multi-peril liability coverage within commercial casualty experienced favorable results for some prior accident years and adverse development on other accident years to end the calendar year flat on all prior years combined. commercial umbrella coverage developed adversely for accident year 2007, but developed favorably for all prior years combined.
•   workers' compensation - we continue to see favorable reserve development, for all prior accident years in aggregate. during 2016, the trend for estimated payments to be made in future calendar years was stable compared to 2015. however, we continue to monitor this line closely, as a sudden increase in trend for future payments has a highly leveraged effect.
•   commercial auto - loss emergence continued to develop unfavorably during calendar year 2016. this line of business has been troublesome for the industry as a whole in recent years. as part of the u.s. economic recession of a few years ago, slowing business activity influenced our estimates of reserves for ultimate losses and loss expenses during that period. as the economy slowly recovered, we believe we have been slow to recognize some of the higher loss cost effects in current accident year reserve estimates for at least part of that period. as claims that occurred during that period have become more mature, paid and reported loss cost trends resulted in us increasing our estimated ultimate losses. initiatives to improve profitability of our commercial auto line of business are discussed in commercial lines insurance results.
•   personal auto - loss emergence continued to develop unfavorably during calendar year 2016. this line of business is subject to many of the same cost pressures related to the economic slowdown as commercial auto. initiatives to improve profitability of our personal auto line of business are discussed in personal lines insurance results.
in consideration of the data's credibility, we analyze commercial and personal umbrella liability reserves together and then allocate the derived total reserve estimate to the commercial and personal coverages. consequently, all of the umbrella factors that contributed to commercial lines reserve development also contributed to personal lines reserve development through the other personal line, of which personal umbrella coverages are a part.
for the excess and surplus lines insurance segment, the table showing reserves by segment and lines of business in property casualty loss and loss expense obligations and reserves, shows the components of gross reserves among case, ibnr and loss expense reserves. total gross reserves were up $14 million from year-end 2015 primarily due to the increase in premiums and exposures for this segment, as we discussed in excess and surplus lines insurance results. favorable development during 2016 of $34 million for excess and surplus lines insurance segment reserves, shown in the table above, illustrates the potential for revisions inherent in estimating reserves.

life insurance policyholder obligations and reserves gross life insurance policyholder obligations our estimates of life, annuity and disability policyholder obligations reflect future estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders for future policy benefits, policyholders' account balances and separate account liabilities. these estimates include death and disability income claims, policy surrenders, policy maturities, annuity payments, minimum guarantees on separate account products, commissions and premium taxes offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force contracts.
our estimates of gross life, annuity and disability obligations do not reflect net recoveries from reinsurance agreements. ceded life reinsurance receivables were $241 million at year-end 2016. as discussed in 2017 reinsurance programs, we purchase reinsurance to mitigate our life insurance risk exposure. at year-end 2016, ceded death benefits represented approximately 40.5 percent of our total gross policy face amounts in force.
these estimated cash outflows are undiscounted with respect to interest. as a result, the sum of the cash outflows for all years of $5.442 billion (total of life insurance obligations) exceeds the liabilities recorded in life policy and investment contract reserves and separate accounts for future policy benefits and claims of $3.411 billion (total of life insurance policy reserves and separate account policy reserves). separate account policy reserves make up all but $10 million of separate accounts liabilities.
we have made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these policies and contracts that include mortality, morbidity, timing of claims, future lapse rates and interest crediting rates. due to the significance of the assumptions used, the amounts presented could materially differ from actual results.
life insurance reserves gross life policy reserves were $2.671 billion at year-end 2016, compared with $2.583 billion at year-end 2015. the increase was primarily due to reserves for traditional life insurance contracts. we establish reserves for traditional life insurance policies based on expected expenses, mortality, morbidity, withdrawal rates and investment yields, including a provision for uncertainty. once these assumptions are established, they generally are maintained throughout the lives of the contracts. we use both our own experience and industry experience adjusted for historical trends in arriving at our assumptions for expected mortality, morbidity and withdrawal rates. we use our own experience and historical trends for setting our assumptions for expected expenses. we base our assumptions for expected investment income on our own experience adjusted for current economic conditions.
we establish reserves for our universal life, deferred annuity and investment contracts equal to the cumulative account balances, which include premium deposits plus credited interest less charges and withdrawals. some of our universal life insurance policies contain no-lapse guarantee provisions. for these policies, we establish a reserve in addition to the account balance based on expected no-lapse guarantee benefits and expected policy assessments.
we regularly review our life insurance business to ensure that any deferred acquisition cost associated with the business is recoverable and that our actuarial liabilities (life insurance segment reserves) make sufficient provision for future benefits and related expenses.

2017 reinsurance ceded programs a single large loss or an unexpected rise in claims severity or frequency due to a catastrophic event is a risk to the company's liquidity and financial strength. in an effort to control such losses, we avoid marketing property casualty insurance in specific geographic areas and monitor our exposure in certain coastal regions. an example of this is the reduction in recent years of our homeowner policies in the southeastern u.s. coastal region. loss exposures in that area had been identified as a major contributor to our catastrophe probable maximum loss estimates shown in the table below. those estimates were subsequently reduced, in large part due to less exposure from southeastern u.s. homeowner policies. we also continually review aggregate exposures to huge disasters and purchase reinsurance protection to cover these exposures. for business other than cincinnati re, we use the risk management solutions (rms) and applied insurance research (air) models to evaluate exposures to a once-in-a-100-year and a once-in-a-250-year event to help determine appropriate reinsurance coverage programs. in conjunction with these activities, we also continue to evaluate information provided by our reinsurance broker. examples include deterministic modeling of probable maximum loss contribution from growth in new geographic territories.
to help determine appropriate reinsurance coverage for hurricane, earthquake and tornado/hail exposures, for business other than cincinnati re we use the rms and air models to estimate the probable maximum loss from a single event or multiple events occurring in a one-year period. the models are proprietary in nature, and the vendors that provide them periodically update the models, sometimes resulting in significant changes to their estimate of probable maximum loss. as of the end of 2016, both models indicated that a hurricane event represents our largest amount of exposure to losses. the table below summarizes estimated probabilities and the corresponding probable maximum loss from a single hurricane event occurring in a one-year period, and indicates the effect of such losses on consolidated shareholders' equity at december 31, 2016. net losses are net of reinsurance and income taxes, and assume our 2017 reinsurance programs apply.

the modeled losses according to rms in the table are based on its risklink version 16.0 catastrophe model and use a long-term storm catalog methodology. the modeled losses according to air in the table are based on its air touchstone version 4.0 catastrophe model and use a long-term methodology. the air storm catalog includes decades of documented weather events used in simulations for probable maximum loss projections.
reinsurance mitigates the risk of highly uncertain exposures and limits the maximum net loss that can arise from large risks or risks concentrated in areas of exposure. management's decisions about the appropriate structure of reinsurance protection and level of risk retention are affected by various factors, including changes in our underwriting practices, capacity to retain risks and reinsurance market conditions.
reinsurance does not relieve us of our obligation to pay covered claims. the financial strength of our reinsurers is important because our ability to recover for losses covered under any reinsurance agreement depends on the financial viability of the reinsurer.
currently participating on our standard market property and casualty per-risk and per-occurrence reinsurance ceded programs are hannover reinsurance company, munich reinsurance america, partner reinsurance company of the u.s. and swiss reinsurance america corporation, all of which had a.m. best insurer financial strength ratings of a (excellent) or better as of december 31, 2016. our property catastrophe program is subscribed through a broker by reinsurers from the united states, bermuda, london and the european markets. the largest participant in our property catastrophe program, representing approximately 48 percent of total participation, is the lloyds of london placement that features numerous syndicates, with amlin underwriting limited and the catlin syndicate taking the largest participations. other primary participants in our property catastrophe program include liberty syndicate, r.j. kiln & company limited, and fidelis.

primary components of the 2017 property and casualty reinsurance program are summarized below. the premium estimates below occurred near the beginning of each respective year, when direct written premiums that were subject to applicable reinsurance treaties were also estimated.
•   property per risk treaty - the primary purpose of the property treaty is to provide capacity up to $25 million, adequate for the majority of the risks we write. it also includes protection for extra-contractual liability coverage losses. we retain the first $10 million of each loss. losses between $10 million and $25 million are reinsured at 100 percent. the 2017 ceded premium estimate was $18 million, essentially unchanged from the 2016 estimate.
•   property excess treaty - for 2017, we again purchased a property reinsurance treaty that provide an additional $25 million in protection for property losses. this treaty, along with the property per risk treaty, provides a total of $50 million of protection. the 2017 ceded premium estimate was approximately $6 million, essentially unchanged from the 2016 estimate.
•   casualty per occurrence treaty - the casualty treaty provides capacity up to $25 million. similar to the property treaty, it provides sufficient capacity to cover the vast majority of casualty accounts we insure and also includes protection for extra-contractual liability coverage losses. we retain the first $10 million of each loss. losses between $10 million and $25 million are reinsured at 100 percent. the 2017 ceded premium estimate was $12 million, essentially unchanged from the 2016 estimate.
•   casualty excess treaty - we purchase a casualty reinsurance treaty that provides an additional $45 million in protection for certain casualty losses. this treaty, along with the casualty per occurrence treaty, provides a total of $70 million of protection for workers' compensation, extra-contractual liability coverage and clash coverage losses, which would apply when a single occurrence involves multiple policyholders of the cincinnati insurance companies or multiple coverages for one insured. the 2017 ceded premium estimate was approximately $3 million, essentially unchanged from the 2016 estimate.
•   property catastrophe treaty - to protect against catastrophic events such as wind and hail, hurricanes or earthquakes, we purchased property catastrophe reinsurance with a limit up to $600 million. losses from the same occurrence can now be aggregated into one limit over a 120-hour period and applied to the treaty towards recovery. the treaty contains one reinstatement provision. the 2017 ceded premium estimate was $39 million, compared with a $41 million estimate for 2016. we retain the first $100 million of any loss, and a share of losses up to $600 million, as indicated below:
◦   5.0 percent of losses between $100 million and $200 million
◦   5.0 percent of losses between $200 million and $300 million
◦   5.0 percent of losses between $300 million and $400 million
◦   5.0 percent of losses between $400 million and $600 million cincinnati financial corporation - 2016 10-k - page 102
•   beginning in 2013 we added an alternative reinsurance structure to protect against certain catastrophic events, and a similar structure is in place for 2017 through 2019. for certain exposures in the united states, we arranged for the purchase of collateralized reinsurance funded through the issuance of collateralized risk-linked securities, known as catastrophe bonds. the catastrophe bond arrangements generally provide reinsurance coverage for specific types of losses in specific geographic locations. they are generally designed to supplement coverage provided under the property catastrophe treaty. effective january 2017, we have a catastrophe bond arrangement providing up to $200 million in earthquake reinsurance protection or $80 million in severe convective storm coverage or various combinations of those coverages. it expires in january 2019. the earthquake coverage is countrywide, excluding california, and the severe convective storm coverage territory is also countrywide, excluding florida. the storm coverage provides loss recovery when storm losses for all events in aggregate exceed $190 million, after an $8 million deductible per event.
after reinsurance, and before any applicable benefit from our catastrophe bond, our maximum exposure to a catastrophic event that causes $600 million in covered losses in 2017 would be $125 million, matching our retention for 2016. the largest catastrophe loss event in our history occurred during 2011 from a may 20-27 storm system that included a tornado in joplin, missouri, and also significant losses from hail in the dayton, ohio, area. our losses from that storm were estimated at december 31, 2016, to be $223 million before reinsurance.
individual risks with insured values in excess of $50 million, as identified in the policy, are handled through a different reinsurance mechanism. we typically reinsure property coverage for individual risks with insured values between $50 million and $85 million under an automatic facultative agreement. for risks with property values exceeding $85 million, we negotiate the purchase of facultative coverage on an individual certificate basis. for casualty coverage on individual risks with limits exceeding $25 million, facultative reinsurance coverage is placed on an individual certificate basis. for risks with casualty limits that are between $25 million and $27 million, we sometimes forego facultative reinsurance and retain an additional $2 million of loss exposure.
terrorism coverage at various levels has been secured in most of our reinsurance agreements. the broadest coverage for this peril is found in the property and casualty working treaties, the property per risk treaty and the casualty per occurrence treaty, which provide coverage for commercial and personal risks. our property catastrophe treaty provides terrorism coverage for personal risks, and coverage for commercial risks with total insured values of $15 million or less. for insured values between $15 million and $50 million, there also may be coverage in the property working treaty.
a form of reinsurance is also provided through the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 (tria). tria was originally signed into law on november 26, 2002, and extended on several occasions, including the most recent extension on january 12, 2015. tria provides a temporary federal backstop for losses related to the writing of the terrorism peril in property casualty insurance policies. under regulations promulgated under this statute, insurers are required to offer terrorism coverage for certain lines of property casualty insurance, including property, commercial multi-peril, fire, ocean marine, inland marine, liability, aircraft and workers' compensation. in the event of a terrorism event defined by tria, the federal government would reimburse terrorism claim payments subject to the insurer's deductible. the deductible is calculated as a percentage of subject written premiums for the preceding calendar year. our deductible in 2016 was $514 million (20 percent of 2015 subject premiums), and we estimate it is $529 million (20 percent of 2016 subject premiums) for 2017.
reinsurance protection for the company's surety business is covered under separate treaties with many of the same reinsurers that write the property casualty working treaties.
the cincinnati specialty underwriters insurance company has separate property and casualty reinsurance treaties for 2017 through its parent, the cincinnati insurance company. primary components of the treaties include:
•   property per risk treaty - the property treaty provides limits up to $5 million, which is adequate capacity for the risk profile we insure. it also includes protection for extra-contractual liability coverage losses. cincinnati specialty underwriters retains the first $500,000 of any policy loss. losses between $500,000 and $5 million are reinsured at 100 percent by the cincinnati insurance company.
•   casualty treaties - the casualty treaty is written on an excess of loss basis and provide limits up to $6 million, which is adequate capacity for the risk profile we insure. a second treaty layer of $5 million excess of $6 million is written to provide coverage for extra contractual obligations or clash exposures. the maximum retention for any one casualty loss is $1 million by cincinnati specialty underwriters. losses between $1 million and $6 million are reinsured at 100 percent by the cincinnati insurance company.
cincinnati financial corporation - 2016 10-k - page 103
•   basket retention - cincinnati specialty underwriters has purchased this coverage to limit our retention to $1 million in the event that the same occurrence results in both a property and a casualty loss.
•   property catastrophe treaty - as a subsidiary of the cincinnati insurance company, cincinnati specialty underwriters is a named insured under our corporate property catastrophe treaty, and for our collateralized reinsurance funded through the issuance of catastrophe bonds. all terms and conditions of this reinsurance coverage apply to policies underwritten by cincinnati specialty underwriters.
for property risks with limits exceeding $5 million or casualty risks with limits exceeding $6 million, underwriters place facultative reinsurance coverage on an individual certificate basis.
cincinnati life, our life insurance subsidiary, purchases reinsurance under separate treaties with many of the same reinsurers that write the property casualty working treaties. our corporate retention is $1 million on a single life. for most of our core term life insurance line of business, we retain no more than a $500,000 exposure on a single policy, ceding the balance using excess over retention mortality coverage, and retaining the policy reserve. because of the conservative nature of statutory reserving principles, retaining the policy reserve unduly depresses our statutory earnings and requires a large commitment of our capital. effective november 1, 2015, we increased our retention to $1 million for issue ages up to 61 years on new term life insurance sales. for issue ages 61 years or older, our retention remains $500,000. for term life insurance business written prior to 2005, we retain 10 percent to 25 percent of each term policy, not to exceed $500,000, ceding the balance of mortality risk and policy reserve.
we also have catastrophe reinsurance coverage on our life insurance operations that reimburses us for covered net losses in excess of $9.5 million. our recovery is capped at $75 million for losses involving our associates.

safe harbor statement this is our "safe harbor" statement under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. our business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements in this report. some of those risks and uncertainties are discussed in item 1a, risk factors.
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to:
•   unusually high levels of catastrophe losses due to risk concentrations, changes in weather patterns, environmental events, terrorism incidents or other causes
•   increased frequency and/or severity of claims or development of claims that are unforeseen at the time of policy issuance
•   inadequate estimates, assumptions or reliance on third-party data used for critical accounting estimates
•   declines in overall stock market values negatively affecting the company's equity portfolio and book value
•   domestic and global events resulting in capital market or credit market uncertainty, followed by prolonged periods of economic instability or recession, that lead to:
◦   significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of a particular security or group of securities and impairment of the asset(s)
◦   significant decline in investment income due to reduced or eliminated dividend payouts from a particular security or group of securities
◦   significant rise in losses from surety and director and officer policies written for financial institutions or other insured entities
•   prolonged low interest rate environment or other factors that limit the company's ability to generate growth in investment income or interest rate fluctuations that result in declining values of fixed-maturity investments, including declines in accounts in which we hold bank-owned life insurance contract assets
•   recession or other economic conditions resulting in lower demand for insurance products or increased payment delinquencies
•   difficulties with technology or data security breaches, including cyberattacks, that could negatively affect our ability to conduct business and our relationships with agents, policyholders and others
•   disruption of the insurance market caused by technology innovations such as driverless cars that could decrease consumer demand for insurance products
•   delays, inadequate data developed internally or from third parties, or performance inadequacies from ongoing development and implementation of underwriting and pricing methods, including telematics and other usage-based insurance methods, or technology projects and enhancements expected to increase our pricing accuracy, underwriting profit and competitiveness
•   increased competition that could result in a significant reduction in the company's premium volume
•   changing consumer insurance-buying habits and consolidation of independent insurance agencies that could alter our competitive advantages
•   inability to obtain adequate ceded reinsurance on acceptable terms, amount of reinsurance coverage purchased, financial strength of reinsurers and the potential for nonpayment or delay in payment by reinsurers
•   inability to defer policy acquisition costs for any business segment if pricing and loss trends would lead management to conclude that segment could not achieve sustainable profitability
•   inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends consistent with current or past levels
•   events or conditions that could weaken or harm the company's relationships with its independent agencies and hamper opportunities to add new agencies, resulting in limitations on the company's opportunities for growth, such as:
◦   downgrades of the company's financial strength ratings
◦   concerns that doing business with the company is too difficult
◦   perceptions that the company's level of service, particularly claims service, is no longer a distinguishing characteristic in the marketplace
◦   inability or unwillingness to nimbly develop and introduce coverage product updates and innovations that our competitors offer and consumers expect to find in the marketplace
•   actions of insurance departments, state attorneys general or other regulatory agencies, including a change to a federal system of regulation from a state-based system, that:
◦   impose new obligations on us that increase our expenses or change the assumptions underlying our critical accounting estimates
◦   place the insurance industry under greater regulatory scrutiny or result in new statutes, rules and regulations
◦   restrict our ability to exit or reduce writings of unprofitable coverages or lines of business cincinnati financial corporation - 2016 10-k - page 105
◦   add assessments for guaranty funds, other insurance‐related assessments or mandatory reinsurance arrangements; or that impair our ability to recover such assessments through future surcharges or other rate changes
◦   increase our provision for federal income taxes due to changes in tax law
◦   increase our other expenses
◦   limit our ability to set fair, adequate and reasonable rates
◦   place us at a disadvantage in the marketplace
◦   restrict our ability to execute our business model, including the way we compensate agents
•   adverse outcomes from litigation or administrative proceedings
•   events or actions, including unauthorized intentional circumvention of controls, that reduce the company's future ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting under the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002
•   unforeseen departure of certain executive officers or other key employees due to retirement, health or other causes that could interrupt progress toward important strategic goals or diminish the effectiveness of certain longstanding relationships with insurance agents and others
•   events, such as an epidemic, natural catastrophe or terrorism, that could hamper our ability to assemble our workforce at our headquarters location further, the company's insurance businesses are subject to the effects of changing social, global, economic and regulatory environments. public and regulatory initiatives have included efforts to adversely influence and restrict premium rates, restrict the ability to cancel policies, impose underwriting standards and expand overall regulation. the company also is subject to public and regulatory initiatives that can affect the market value for its common stock, such as measures affecting corporate financial reporting and governance. the ultimate changes and eventual effects, if any, of these initiatives are uncertain.

more specifically, we refer you to the sections titled special note regarding forward-looking statements at the beginning of part i of this report and risk factors set forth in item 1a of this report, as well as in other subsequent reports we file with the securities and exchange commission, for a more detailed explanation of these and other factors and risks that may cause such predictive statements to turn out differently than expected or anticipated. these reports are available publicly on the securities and exchange commission website, www.sec.gov, and on our website, www.steeldynamics.com under "investors - sec filings".
operating statement classifications net sales.  net sales from our operations are a factor of volumes shipped, product mix and related pricing. we charge premium prices for certain grades of steel, product dimensions, certain smaller volumes, and for value-added processing or coating of the steel products.  except for the steel fabrication operations, we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated returns and claims from these sales at the time the title of the product transfers, upon shipment. provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on historical experience. if the historical data used in the estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends, additional provision may be necessary. our steel fabrication operations recognizes revenues from construction contracts utilizing a percentage of completion methodology based on steel tons used on completed units to date as a percentage of estimated total steel tons required for each contract.
costs of goods sold.  our costs of goods sold represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products. the principal elements of these costs are scrap and scrap substitutes (which represent the most significant single component of our consolidated costs of goods sold), steel, direct and indirect labor and related benefits, alloys, zinc, transportation and freight, repairs and maintenance, electricity, and depreciation.
selling, general and administrative expenses.  selling, general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales, finance and accounting, and administrative departments. these costs include, among other items, labor and related benefits, professional services, insurance premiums, property taxes, company-wide profit sharing, and amortization of intangible assets.
interest expense, net of capitalized interest.  interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt net of interest costs that are required to be capitalized during the construction period of certain capital investment projects.
other expense (income), net.  other income consists of interest income earned on our temporary cash deposits and investments and any other non-operating income activity, including income from non-consolidated investments accounted for under the equity method. other expense consists of any non-operating costs, such as certain acquisition and financing expenses.

2016 overview we are one of the largest steel producers and one of the largest metals recyclers in the united states based on a current estimated annual steelmaking and coating capability of approximately 11 million tons, and actual recycling volumes. the primary sources of our revenues and operating income are from the manufacture and sale of steel products, processing and sale of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals, and fabrication and sale of steel joists and deck. we have three reportable segments: steel operations, metals recycling operations, and steel fabrication operations.
our consolidated results for 2016 benefited from positive momentum in the sheet steel supply environment, driving improved sheet steel volume and metal spreads, as well as increased metal spread and operating cost reductions in our metals recycling operations. underlying domestic steel consumption remained relatively consistent, as the automotive markets were strong and construction improved throughout the year, while heavy equipment, agriculture and energy markets remained weak. sheet steel import levels declined during 2016 as compared to 2015, amidst the duties levied pursuant to the trade cases filed with the united states international trade commission, and customer inventory levels remained low compared to historical averages. domestic steel mill utilization rates were flat in 2016 compared to 2015, resulting in lower ferrous volumes in our metals recycling operations, our metal spreads improved, particularly in nonferrous materials, and we benefited from continued operational cost containment efforts. the non-residential construction market for our steel fabrication operations remained strong, resulting in record shipments; however, average selling prices contracted, outpacing declining steel input costs, resulting in compressed metal spread during 2016.
asset impairment charges during the fourth quarter of 2016, we undertook an assessment of the recoverability of the carrying amounts of primarily the mining resources and mesabi mining fixed assets within our minnesota ironmaking operations. with our outlook at the time of this assessment regarding future cash flows, we concluded that the carrying value of some of the fixed assets was no longer fully recoverable, and they were in fact impaired. this assessment resulted in a $127.3 million non-cash asset impairment charge, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $13.1 million, which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by $72.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. also, during the fourth quarter of 2016, a $5.5 million omnisource goodwill impairment charge was recorded in conjunction with omnisource entering into a definitive sale agreement with a third-party pertaining to certain omnisource long-lived assets (classified and reported as held for sale as of december 31, 2016), inventory and spare parts, as provided under asc 350. vulcan threaded products, inc. acquisition on august 1, 2016, we acquired 100% of vulcan threaded products, inc. (vulcan) for $113.0 million, paid in cash from available funds. vulcan is the nation's largest manufacturer and supplier of threaded rod products, and also produces cold drawn and heat treated steel bar. the acquisition of vulcan is consistent with one of our target growth objectives - higher-margin downstream business opportunities that utilize our steel products in their manufacturing processes. vulcan utilizes special-bar-quality products produced at our engineered bar products division. post-closing operating results of vulcan are reflected in the steel operations reporting segment.
excluding the impact of the $132.8 million and $428.5 million in pretax non-cash asset impairment charges in 2016 and 2015, respectively, consolidated operating income increased $505.1 million, or 142%, to $860.8 million in 2016, compared to $355.7 million in 2015, and net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. increased $320.3 million, or 232%, to $458.6 million, or $1.87 per diluted share, during 2016, compared with net income of $138.3 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, during 2015. the impact of the $132.8 million pretax non-cash asset impairment charges, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $13.1 million, reduced 2016 net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by $76.4 million and our diluted earnings per share by $0.31. the impact of the $428.5 million pretax non-cash asset impairment charge reduced 2015 net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by $268.7 million and our diluted earnings per share by $1.11.

2015 overview our 2015 consolidated operational and financial results were negatively impacted by decreased steel shipments (excluding columbus flat roll division for the 2015 and 2014 periods) and average steel product pricing, driven by excessive and historically high levels of steel imports. while scrap costs also decreased significantly throughout 2015, steel metal margins contracted as the drop in steel selling prices was more severe than the decline of scrap costs. underlying domestic steel consumption remained steady, as we continued to see improvements in non-residential construction, as well as steady consumption in automotive and other manufacturing segments. however, a larger portion of the domestic steel demand was served by imports in 2015 than compared to 2014. as a result of this, as well as customer destocking, domestic steel mill utilization rates decreased throughout 2015, as compared to 2014, resulting in decreased ferrous scrap shipments in our metals recycling operations. decreased shipments, along with metal margin compression due to monthly price declines, resulted in significantly reduced profitability in our metals recycling operations in 2015, as compared to 2014. during 2015, our steel fabrication operations continued to benefit from the sustained improvements in non-residential construction demand, our market share and expanding geographic footprint, and lower steel raw material costs, resulting in significant increases in both sales and operating income, compared to 2014.
asset impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded pretax non-cash impairment charges related to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles and certain other assets associated with omnisource, our metal recycling operations, which reduced 2015 operating income by $428.5 million, and net income and net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by $268.7 million, and basic and diluted earnings per share by $1.11. during our 2015 annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analysis, we determined that the fair value of omnisource was less than its carrying value, and upon the completion of the second step of the impairment analysis, that the goodwill and trade name indefinite-lived intangible assets were impaired. the omnisource goodwill and trade name assets were written down to their respective fair values, resulting in non-cash asset impairment charges of $341.3 million and $68.5 million, respectively. upon the december 31, 2015, determination and classification of certain omnisource property and plant assets as held for sale, we recorded a $10.3 million non-cash asset impairment. we reflected a total of $428.5 million of pretax non-cash asset impairment charges in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31, 2015, within the metals recycling operations. during the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded a $260.0 million pretax non-cash asset impairment charge in other non-segment operations, related primarily to mesabi nugget fixed assets within our minnesota ironmaking operations, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $46.5 million, which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by $132.6 million excluding the impact of the $428.5 million and $260.0 million in pretax non-cash impairment charges in 2015 and 2014, respectively, consolidated operating income decreased $224.6 million, or 39%, to $355.7 million in 2015, compared to $580.3 million in 2014, and net income decreased $151.3 million, or 52%, to $138.3 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, during 2015, compared with net income of $289.6 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, during 2014. the impact of the $428.5 million pretax non-cash impairment charge related to our metals recycling operations reduced 2015 net income by $268.7 million and our diluted earnings per share by $1.11. the impact of the $260.0 million pretax non-cash asset impairment charge related to our minnesota ironmaking operations, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $46.5 million, reduced 2014 net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by $132.6 million and our diluted earnings per share by $0.55.

segment results 2016 vs. 2015
overall steel operations performance in 2016 compared to 2015 benefited from positive momentum throughout the year in the sheet steel supply environment, as the excessively high levels of steel imports experienced in 2015 and 2014 declined approximately 15% in 2016 on a year-over-year basis. duties levied in 2016 pursuant to the trade case rulings from the united states international trade commission, coupled with low customer inventories compared to historical levels, precipitated higher domestic steel shipments and higher utilization for our steel mills. our steel mill utilization rate improved to 87% for 2016, as compared to 79% in 2015, with our sheet steel utilization rate improving to 99% in 2016 from 86% in 2015. the domestic steel demand outlook remained relatively unchanged throughout 2016, as automotive markets were strong and construction improved throughout the year, while heavy equipment, agriculture and energy markets remained challenged. overall steel selling prices improved during the last three quarters of 2016 from the significant decline that occurred throughout 2015 and early 2016 as sheet steel imports declined. net sales for the steel operations increased 8% in 2016, when compared to 2015, as an 11% increase in steel operations shipments more than offset a decrease of $15 per ton, or 2%, in average selling prices.
metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant steel manufacturing cost, generally comprising approximately 60% of our steel operations' manufacturing costs, excluding the operations of the techs and vulcan, which purchase, rather than produce, the steel they further process. our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel operations decreased $35, or 14%, in 2016 compared to 2015, consistent with overall ferrous scrap market pricing.
operating income for the steel operations increased 130%, to $927.0 million, in 2016, compared to 2015, due to an 11% increase in steel shipments coupled with a 5% increase in overall steel operations metal spread (which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of ferrous scrap consumed) expansion. sheet steel metal spread expanded 15%, while long products metal spread contracted 9%, as domestic overcapacity and an aggressive competitive environment continued.

segment results 2015 vs. 2014
overall steel operations performance in 2015 compared to 2014 was negatively impacted by excessive and historically high levels of steel imports, customers destocking inventories, and sharply falling steel and scrap prices. domestic steel consumption was relatively steady during 2015, with strong automotive and improving non-residential steel markets, but a large portion of the domestic consumption was served by imports. net sales for the steel operations decreased 7% in 2015, when compared to 2014, as a 14% increase in steel operations shipments was more than offset by a decrease of $149 per ton, or 18%, in average selling prices. in spite of solid overall domestic steel demand, average selling prices decreased throughout 2015 due to elevated levels of imported steel into the united states and significant reductions in the cost of scrap, which also caused uncertainty for steel consumers. steel operations shipments increased 14% in 2015 compared to 2014 with the inclusion of columbus flat roll division for the full year of 2015 (acquired september 16, 2014), as 2015 sales volumes, excluding columbus flat roll division, were down 12% compared to 2014.
metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant steel manufacturing cost, generally comprising approximately 60% of our steel operations' manufacturing costs. our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel operations decreased $105, or 29%, in 2015, compared with 2014, consistent with overall declines in ferrous scrap market pricing.
decreases in steel selling prices more than offset decreases in raw material cost per ton, resulting in 2015 metal spread contracting significantly compared to 2014. thus, despite increased shipments from the inclusion of columbus flat roll division for the full year 2015 versus only four and a half months in 2014, operating income for the steel operations decreased 41%, to $403.2 million, compared to 2014.

metals recycling operations segment metals recycling operations segment.  metals recycling operations consists solely of omnisource and includes both ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal processing, transportation, marketing, brokerage, and consulting services strategically located primarily in close proximity to our steel mills and other end-user scrap consumers throughout the eastern half of the united states.  in addition, omnisource designs, installs, and manages customized scrap management programs for industrial manufacturing companies at approximately 700 locations throughout north america. our steel mills utilize a large portion of the ferrous scrap processed through omnisource as raw material in our steelmaking operations, and the remainder is sold to other consumers, such as other steel manufacturers and foundries. our metals recycling operations accounted for 15%, 19%, and 25% of our consolidated net sales in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

metals recycling operations operating income in 2016 of $20.4 million was $40.1 million higher than 2015 (excluding the impact in 2015 of $428.5 million of impairment charges), due to our continued focus on reduction of operating costs, along with improved ferrous and nonferrous metal spreads (which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased scrap). net sales decreased 7% in 2016 compared to 2015, with ferrous and nonferrous selling prices decreasing 5% and 9%, respectively. while total ferrous and nonferrous shipments were comparable during 2016 and 2015, metal spreads increased 11% and 10%, respectively, as scrap costs declined more than selling prices, driving improved operating income during 2016. with improved utilization at our steel mills in 2016, the metals recycling operations ferrous shipments to our mills increased to 61% of total tons shipped in 2016, compared to 54% in 2015.
segment results 2015 vs. 2014
metals recycling operations performance in 2015 compared to 2014 was negatively impacted by excess domestic scrap competition, a strong united states dollar tempering scrap exports, and lower domestic steel mill utilizations, resulting in substantial decreases in selling prices. metals recycling operations net sales decreased 34% in 2015 as compared to 2014, with ferrous and nonferrous volumes both decreasing 8% in 2015, as compared to 2014. similarly, both ferrous and nonferrous selling prices declined 37% and 18%, respectively, during 2015, as compared to 2014, consistent with overall declines in scrap market selling prices. metal spreads for ferrous and nonferrous materials contracted 14% and 18%,
35
respectively, during 2015 as compared to 2014 as selling prices declined more than scrap costs. operating loss for the metals recycling operations in 2015 of $448.1 million includes $428.5 million of pretax non-cash impairment charges related to goodwill, trade name and other assets. excluding the impairment charges, metals recycling operations segment operating loss is $19.6 million compared to operating income of $26.0 million in 2014.

steel fabrication operations segment steel fabrication operations segment.  steel fabrication operations include our eight new millennium building systems' joist and deck plants located throughout the united states and in northern mexico. revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of steel joists, trusses, girders and steel deck used within the non-residential construction industry. steel fabrication operations accounted for 9% of our consolidated net sales during 2016 and 2015 and 7% during 2014.
segment results 2016 vs. 2015
the non-residential construction market remained strong during 2016; however, decreased overall annual selling prices outpaced decreased overall annual steel input costs, resulting in metal spread (which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased steel) compression. as a result of record shipments, which more than offset decreased selling prices, net sales for the steel fabrication operations increased $30.1 million, or 4%, in 2016, compared to 2015. the purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of production for our steel fabrication operations, generally representing approximately two-thirds of the total cost of manufacturing. metal spread declined 10% in 2016, compared to 2015, as a $116 per ton, or 8%, decrease in average selling prices outpaced a 7% decrease in the average cost of steel consumed. this resulted in a 22% decrease in operating income to $91.0 million in 2016, as compared to $115.9 million in 2015. segment results 2015 vs. 2014
overall steel fabrication operations performance in 2015 compared to 2014 was positively impacted by a recovering non-residential construction market, increased average selling prices, and lower costs of manufacturing due to lower steel input prices. net sales for the steel fabrication operations increased $41.6 million, or 7%, in 2015, compared to 2014, as shipments increased 3% and average selling prices increased $51 per ton, or 4%, with increased demand. the average cost of steel consumed decreased by 14% in 2015, as compared to 2014, and coupled with 4% higher selling prices resulted in significantly expanded metal spreads. as a result of record shipments, increased selling prices and metal spread expansion, as well as decreased conversion costs realized from manufacturing efficiencies, operating income increased 123% to $115.9 million in 2015, as compared to $51.9 million in 2014.

other operations other operations consists of subsidiary operations that are below the quantitative thresholds required for reportable segments and primarily consist of our minnesota ironmaking operations that were indefinitely idled in may 2015, and smaller joint ventures. also included in "other" are certain unallocated corporate accounts, such as the company's senior secured credit facility, senior notes, certain other investments and certain profit sharing expenses.
our minnesota ironmaking operations consists of mesabi nugget, (owned 83% by us); our wholly-owned iron concentrate and potential future iron mining operations, mesabi mining; and our wholly-owned (as of december 31, 2016) iron tailings operations, mining resources.as of december 31, 2016, we acquired all $15.1 million of the mining resources noncontrolling investor's units of redeemable noncontrolling stock it owned at the time for cancellation and discharge of all obligations owed to mining resources and termination of all existing agreements with the noncontrolling investor at that time. prior to this transaction, 82% of mining resources was owned by us.
significant events occurred during the fourth quarter of 2016, including the previously noted termination of all existing agreements with the mining resources noncontrolling investor, that represented impairment indicators related primarily to mining resources and mesabi mining fixed assets within our minnesota ironmaking operations. these impairment indicators were substantively separate and different from the impairment indicators that existed within our minnesota ironmaking operations in the fourth quarter of 2014, discussed below. with the company's outlook at the time of this 2016 assessment regarding future cash flows, the company concluded that the carrying amounts of the fixed assets were no longer fully recoverable, and they were in fact impaired.  this assessment resulted in a non-cash asset impairment charge of $127.3 million, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $13.1 million, which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by $72.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016.
during the fourth quarter of 2014, our minnesota ironmaking operations reached a steady operating state, indicating a consistency in the operations' production capability, processes and cost structure, including the ability to utilize certain lower-cost raw materials. given this we undertook an assessment of the recoverability of the minnesota ironmaking operations, based upon impairment indicators at that time.  given our outlook at that time regarding future operating costs and product pricing and resulting future cash flows, we concluded that the carrying amounts of primarily our mesabi nugget fixed assets, within our minnesota ironmaking operations, were no longer fully recoverable, and were in fact impaired.  this assessment resulted in non-cash asset impairment charge of $260.0 million, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $46.5 million, which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by $132.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2014.
consolidated results 2016 vs. 2015
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses (including profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets) of $474.1 million during 2016 increased 26% from $376.0 million during 2015, representing approximately 6.1% and 5.0% of net sales, respectively. the increase in 2016 compared to 2015 is due most notably to increased performance-based incentive compensation, including profit sharing, associated with our increased profitability.
interest expense, net of capitalized interest. during 2016, interest expense decreased $7.9 million to $146.0 million, when compared to 2015. the decrease in interest expense is due primarily to the call and prepayment of our $350.0 million 7 5/8% senior notes due 2020, in march 2015.
other expense (income), net. during 2016, net other expense of $17.8 million included $16.5 million of call premium and other financing costs associated with the december 2016 senior notes tender, call and prepayment. net other expense of $15.4 million in 2015 includes $16.7 million of call premium and other financing costs associated with the march 2015 senior notes call and prepayment.
income tax expense (benefit). during 2016, our income tax expense was $204.1 million at an effective income tax rate of 36.2%, as compared to a benefit of $96.9 million resulting in an effective income tax rate of 40.0% during 2015. the lower effective tax rate in 2016 was due primarily to benefits from other permanent tax benefit items, most notably the 2016 domestic manufacturing deduction, available in years with taxable income.
included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits of $19.1 million at december 31, 2016, are potential benefits of $11.8 million that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. we recognize interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies on a net-of-tax basis in income tax expense. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recognized expense from the increase of interest expense of $170,000, net of tax.  in addition to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above, we had $4.8 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at december 31, 2016.
we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions. the irs is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the years 2010 through 2015.  at this time, we do not believe there will be any significant examination adjustments that would result in a material change to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months as a result of these federal income tax audits, and state income tax audits. based on the current audits in process, the payment of taxes as a result of audit settlements could be in an amount from zero to $5.7 million by the end of 2017. with the exception of the 2010 federal return which is currently under audit, we are no longer subject to federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years ended before 2011.

consolidated results 2015 vs. 2014
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses (including profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets) of $376.0 million during 2015 were comparable to $385.9 million during 2014, representing approximately 4.9% and 4.4% of net sales, respectively.
interest expense, net of capitalized interest. during 2015, interest expense increased $17.7 million, or 12%, to $154.0 million, when compared to 2014. the increase in interest expense is due primarily to the addition of the $1.2 billion senior notes in september 2014, in conjunction with our acquisition of columbus flat roll division, partially offset by the conversion or payoff at maturity of $287.5 million of 5.125% convertible notes in june 2014, and the call and prepayment of our $350.0 million 75/8% senior notes due 2020 in march 2015.
other expense (income), net. during 2015, net other expense of $15.4 million included $16.7 million of call premium and other financing costs associated with the march 2015 senior notes call and prepayment. net other expense of $18.3 million in 2014 included $25.2 million of acquisition and financing costs associated with our september 2014 columbus flat roll division acquisition.
income tax expense (benefit). during 2015, our income tax benefit was $96.9 million at an effective income tax rate of 40.0%, as compared to expense of $73.2 million resulting in an effective income tax rate of 44.4% during 2014. the higher effective tax rate in 2014 was due primarily to the impact of the increased noncontrolling interest losses, offset somewhat by increased benefits from other permanent tax benefit items, most notably the domestic manufacturing deduction, available in years with taxable income.
liquidity and capital resources capital resources and long‐term debt. our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for, among other things, the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steel, metals recycling, and steel fabrication operations, and to remain in compliance with environmental laws. our short-term and long-term liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements, capital expenditures, principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness, dividends to our shareholders, and acquisitions. we have met these liquidity requirements primarily with cash provided by operations and long-term borrowings, and we also have availability under our revolver. our liquidity at december 31, 2016, is as follows (in thousands):

cash and equivalents             $841,483
revolver availability           1,187,588
total liquidity                $2,029,071
in december 2016, we issued $400.0 million of 5.000% senior notes due 2026 (the "2026 notes"), the proceeds of which, along with available cash, were used to fund the december 2016 tender offer to purchase at a redemption price of 103.388% a total of $266.3 million principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of repurchase, of our 6.125% senior notes due 2019 (the "2019 notes"), and the december 2016 call and repayment at a redemption price of 103.063% of the $133.7 million remaining outstanding principal amount of the 2016 notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of repayment. in addition, we repaid the remaining $228.1 million of outstanding senior term loan debt in december 2016, which was set to mature on november 14, 2019. we recorded expenses related to tender and call premiums, write off of unamortized debt issuance costs, and other expenses of $16.5 million, which are reflected in other expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31, 2016.
our total outstanding debt decreased $237.8 million during 2016, to $2.4 billion, due primarily to our december 2016 prepayment of $228.1 million of outstanding senior term loan debt as described above. as a result, our total long-term debt to capitalization ratio (representing our long-term debt, including current maturities, divided by the sum of our long-term debt, redeemable noncontrolling interests, and our total stockholders' equity) decreased to 44.9% at december 31, 2016, from 49.3% at december 31, 2015.
our november 2014 senior secured credit facility (facility), which provides a $1.2 billion revolver, matures november 2019. subject to certain conditions, we have the opportunity to increase the revolver size by at least $750.0 million. the facility is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries; and is secured by substantially all of our and our wholly-owned subsidiaries' receivables and inventories, and by pledges of all shares of our wholly-owned subsidiaries' capital stock or other equity interests, and intercompany debt held by us as collateral. the revolver is available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes. the facility contains financial covenants and other covenants pertaining to our ability (which may under certain circumstances be limited) to make capital expenditures; incur indebtedness; permit liens on property; enter into transactions with affiliates; make restricted payments or investments; enter into mergers, acquisitions or consolidations; conduct asset sales; pay dividends or distributions, or enter into other specified transactions and activities. our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants. at december 31, 2016, we had $1.2 billion of availability on the revolver, $12.4 million of outstanding letters of credit and other obligations which reduce availability, and there were no borrowings outstanding.
the financial covenants under our facility state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.50:1.00. our interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our last-twelve-months (ltm) consolidated adjusted ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and certain other non-cash transactions as allowed in the facility) by our ltm gross interest expense, less amortization of financing fees. in addition, a net debt (as defined in the facility) to consolidated ltm adjusted ebitda (net debt leverage ratio) of not more than 5.00:1.00
38
must be maintained. if the net debt leverage ratio exceeds 3.50:1:00 at any time, our ability to make certain payments as defined in the facility (which includes cash dividends to stockholders and share purchases, among other things), is limited. at december 31, 2016, our interest coverage ratio and net debt leverage ratio were 8.32:1.00 and 1.58:1.00, respectively. we were, therefore, in compliance with these covenants at december 31, 2016, and we anticipate we will continue to be in compliance during the next twelve months.
working capital. we generated cash flow from operations of $852.8 million in 2016. operational working capital (representing amounts invested in trade receivables and inventories, less current liabilities other than income taxes payable and debt) of $1.3 billion at december 31, 2016, was comparable to that at december 31, 2015. increases in volumes, pricing and profitability have resulted in increased accounts receivable and inventory, which have been largely offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
capital investments. during 2016, we invested $198.2 million in property, plant and equipment, compared with $114.5 million during 2015. our current estimated 2017 cash allocation plan includes the investment of approximately $200 million in capital expenditures in our existing and announced operations.
cash dividends. as a reflection of continued confidence in our current and future cash flow generation ability and financial position, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 2% to $0.1400 per share in the first quarter 2016 (from $0.1375 per share in 2015), resulting in declared cash dividends of $136.5 million during 2016, compared to $133.2 million during 2015. we paid cash dividends of $135.8 million and $127.6 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively. our board of directors, along with executive management, approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis. the determination to pay cash dividends in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors, after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, outstanding indebtedness, current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans. in addition, the terms of our facility and the indentures relating to our senior notes may restrict the amount of cash dividends we can pay.
other. our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which, in turn, will depend upon general economic, financial and business conditions, along with competition, legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control. in addition, we cannot assure that our operating results, cash flows, access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future. we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth, cash flows from operations, together with other available sources of funds, including additional borrowings under our revolver through its term, will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, funding working capital requirements, and anticipated capital expenditures.
during 2016, we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements and credits of approximately $22.2 million. based on our current abatements and incentive credits, and utilizing our existing long-lived asset structure, we estimate the remaining annual benefit to our future operations to be approximately $14.2 million, $10.5 million, $8.9 million, $3.0 million, $2.9 million, $2.8 million, and $2.3 million during the years 2017 through 2023, respectively.
contractual obligations and other long-term liabilities we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations, including purchase obligations, as defined by the securities and exchange commission. a "purchase obligation" is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. other long-term liabilities are defined as long-term liabilities that are reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles. based on this definition, the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations. it does not include normal purchases, which are made in the ordinary course of business. the following table provides aggregated information about outstanding contractual obligations and other long-term liabilities as of december 31, 2016 (in thousands):

(1)the long-term debt payment information presented above assumes that our senior notes remain outstanding until maturity. refer to note 3 long-term debt to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding these transactions, and our long-term debt.
(2)the estimated interest payments shown above assume interest rates of 5.125% on our $700.0 million senior unsecured notes due october 2021; 63/8% on our $350.0 million senior unsecured notes due august 2022; 51/4% on our $400.0 million senior unsecured notes due april 2023; 5.500% on our $500.0 million senior unsecured notes due october 2024; 5.00% on our $400.0 million senior unsecured notes due december 2026; 0.25% commitment fee on our available revolver; and an average of 5.6% on our other debt of $36.8 million.
39
(3)purchase obligations include commitments we have for the purchase of electricity, natural gas and its transportation, fuel, air products, and zinc. these arrangements have "take or pay" or other similar commitment provisions. we have utilized such "take or pay" requirements during the past three years under these contracts, except for certain air products at our minnesota ironmaking operations which were idled in may 2015.
(4)construction commitments relate to firm contracts we have with various vendors for the completion of certain construction projects at our various divisions at december 31, 2016.
(5)other commitments principally relate to certain pension and deferred compensation plan obligations.
(6)we expect to make cash outlays in the future related to our unrecognized tax benefits; however, due to the uncertainty of the timing, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of $23.9 million as of december 31, 2016, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.  refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information.    other matters inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations.
environmental and other contingencies we have incurred, and in the future will continue to incur, capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control, remediation, monitoring and compliance. during 2016, we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately $36.5 million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately $5.3 million. of the costs incurred during 2016 for monitoring and compliance, approximately 79% were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in our steelmaking processes and other facilities, in accordance with legal requirements. we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately $879,000 at all of our facilities during 2016. we have an accrual of $2.5 million recorded for environmental remediation related to our metals recycling operations, $2.6 million related to minnesota ironmaking operations. we believe, apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and any future manufacturing facilities, that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity; however, environmental laws and regulations evolve and change, and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future, such as the impact of united states government or various governmental agencies introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential of climate change. critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions. we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts. except for our steel fabrication operations, we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated returns and customer claims from these sales at the time title of the product transfers, upon shipment. provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on historical experience. if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends, additional provision may be necessary. our steel fabrication operations recognizes revenues from construction contracts using a percentage of completion methodology based on steel tons used on completed units to date as a percentage of estimated total steel tons required by each contract. the allowance for doubtful accounts for all operating segments is based on our best estimate of probable credit losses, along with historical experience, which estimates may or may not prove accurate.
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers, which in steel operations are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to numerous industry sectors, including the construction, automotive, manufacturing, transportation, heavy and agriculture equipment, and pipe and tube (including octg) markets. our metals recycling operations sell ferrous scrap to steel mills and foundries, and nonferrous scrap, such as copper, brass, aluminum and stainless steel to, among others, ingot manufacturers, copper refineries and mills, smelters, and specialty mills. our steel fabrication operations sell fabricated steel joists and deck primarily to the non-residential construction market. we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based on known credit risks, historical loss experience and current economic conditions affecting our customers. we mitigate our
40
exposure to credit risk, which we generally extend initially on an unsecured basis, by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary, such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the customer receivable. if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowance may be required.
inventories. we record inventories at lower of cost or market. cost is determined using a weighted average cost method for raw materials and supplies, and on a first-in, first-out, basis for other inventory. we record amounts required, if any, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value as a charge to cost of goods sold.  if product selling prices were to decline in future periods, further write-down of inventory could result, specifically raw material inventory such as scrap purchased during periods of peak market pricing. upon deciding to idle the minnesota ironmaking operations and to monetize existing raw material inventory, we recorded an inventory lower of cost or market charge of $21.0 million (inclusive of noncontrolling interests of $3.6 million), in cost of goods sold in the second quarter 2015.
impairments of long-lived tangible and definite‐lived intangible assets. we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. impairment losses are recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying amounts. the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount. we consider various factors and determine whether an impairment test is necessary, including by way of examples, a significant and prolonged deterioration in operating results and/or projected cash flows, significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, technological advances with respect to assets which would potentially render them obsolete, our strategy and capital planning, and the economic climate in markets to be served. when determining future cash flows and if necessary, fair value, we must make judgments as to the expected utilization of assets and estimated future cash flows related to those assets. we consider historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all other available information at the time the estimates are made. those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate.
a long-lived asset is classified as held for sale upon meeting specified criteria related to ability and intent to sell. an asset classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, the company reported $29.3 and $8.6 million, respectively, of assets held for sale within other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet.  an impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset held for sale to its fair value less cost to sell.  for assets determined to be classified as held for sale in the year ended december, 31, 2016, the asset carry amounts approximated their fair value less cost to sell.  we recorded $10.3 million asset impairment charge in the consolidated statement of operations for assets determined to be classified as held for sale in the year ended december 31, 2015.  the company determined fair value using level 3 inputs as provided for under asc 820, consisting of information provided by brokers and other external sources along with management's own assumptions.
significant events occurred during the fourth quarter of 2016, including the previously noted termination of all existing agreements with the mining resources noncontrolling investor, that represented impairment indicators related primarily to mining resources and mesabi mining fixed assets within our minnesota ironmaking operations. these impairment indicators were substantively separate and different from the impairment indicators that existed within our minnesota ironmaking operations in the fourth quarter of 2014, discussed below.  with the company's outlook at the time of this 2016 assessment regarding future cash flows, the company concluded that the carrying amounts of the fixed assets were no longer fully recoverable, and they were in fact impaired.  this assessment resulted in a non-cash asset impairment charge of $127.3 million, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $13.1 million, which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by $72.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016.
during the fourth quarter of 2014, our minnesota ironmaking operations reached a steady operating state, indicating a consistency in the operations' production capability, processes and cost structure, including the ability to utilize certain lower-cost raw materials. given this we undertook an assessment of the recoverability of the minnesota ironmaking operations, based upon impairment indicators at that time.  given our outlook at that time regarding future operating costs and product pricing and resulting future cash flows, we concluded that the carrying amounts of primarily our mesabi nugget fixed assets, within our minnesota ironmaking operations, were no longer fully recoverable, and were in fact impaired.  this assessment resulted in non-cash asset impairment charge of $260.0 million, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $46.5 million, which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by $132.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2014.
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets.    our goodwill relates to various business combinations and is allocated to the following reporting units at december 31 (in thousands):

at least once annually (as of october 1) or when indicators of impairment exist, the company performs an impairment test for goodwill. goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally one level below the company's operating segments. we utilize a two-stepped approach to evaluate goodwill impairment. the first step of the test determines if there is potential goodwill impairment. in this step the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount (which includes goodwill). the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows utilizing a risk-adjusted discount rate to calculate the net present value of future cash flows (income approach), and by using a market approach based upon an analysis of valuation metrics of comparable peer companies, level 3 inputs as provided for under asc 820. if the fair value exceeds the carrying value, there is no impairment. if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the company performs the second step of the test, which measures the amount of impairment loss to be recorded. in the second step, the company compares the carrying amount of the goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill based on the net fair value of the recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to which it is allocated. if the implied fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value.
key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the discounted cash flows method (income approach) include: (a) expected cash flows for the five-year period following the testing date (including market share, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce and estimated capital needs); (b) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit; and (c) a risk-adjusted discount rate based on management's best estimate of market participants' after-tax weighted average cost of capital and market risk premiums. key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the market approach include the expected revenues and cash flows in the next year. we consider historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated. those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate.
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in past transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on operating plans and economic conditions at the time of acquisition. consequently, if operating results and/or economic conditions deteriorate after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets. a deterioration of economic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models, but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and/or discount rates. additionally, we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. as a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed. therefore, we may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset or assets in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts.
at least annually (as of october 1) or when indicators of impairment exist, we test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment through the comparison of the fair value of the specific intangible asset with its carrying amount.  the fair value of the intangible asset is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows attributable to the asset and a risk-adjusted discount rate to compute a net present value of future cash flows (income approach).  if the fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to the excess in carrying value.
our other indefinite-lived intangible assets at december 31, 2015, related to trade names acquired through the omnisource ($39.5 million) and the techs ($81.8 million) business combinations. we assigned definite useful lives for the techs trade name in january 2016, and the omnisource trade name in november 2016, and thus began to amortize these intangible assets.
during our 2015 annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment, we determined that the fair value of omnisource was less than its carrying value, and upon the completion of the impairment analysis, that the goodwill and trade name indefinite-lived assets were impaired. the decrease in omnisource fair value from our 2014 impairment analysis was due primarily to the reduction in expected future cash flows based on management's view at the time of the 2015 analysis of the weak longer-term global scrap commodity outlook. this outlook became clearer in the fourth quarter of 2015 from the longevity of: 1) the prolonged strength of the united states dollar decreasing scrap export volume (resulting in excess domestic supply); 2) currency devaluation contributing to china and russia supplying alternative scrap materials to turkey, versus those coming from the united states; and 3) slower global growth decreasing demand for scrap. while the scrap commodity outlook deteriorated throughout much of 2015, there were indicators of improvement during the year such as the restoration of the ratio of iron ore to scrap costs to a more historically consistent relationship, as well as a mid-year scrap pricing increase, versus the monthly decreases experienced throughout much of the year, including large decreases in both the first and fourth quarters.  upon the fourth quarter decrease in selling prices and resulting metal spreads, we concluded that the impact of the factors noted above were longer-term, which resulted in our reassessment of our future long-term cash flows. the omnisource goodwill and trade name indefinite-lived intangible assets were written down to their respective fair values, resulting in pretax non-cash asset impairment charges of $341.3 million and $68.5 million, respectively, that are reflected in asset impairment charges in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31, 2015, within the metals recycling operations.
our fourth quarter 2016 annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analyses did not result in any impairment charges.  management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that our reporting units will fail step one of a goodwill impairment test in the near term. the most significant portion of our goodwill relates to the omnisource reporting unit. the fair value of omnisource exceeded its carrying value by approximately 19%. our analysis, based on economic and industry forecasts, as well as planned organic growth and cost containment activities, contemplates growth in overall scrap consumption and thus our sales volumes, and resulting expansion of our metal margins. while management believes these assumptions are reasonable and their use appropriate, actual results may not meet forecasted results.  an approximate 15% decrease in forecasted cash flows would not result in a failure of step 1 for the omnisource reporting unit. the risk-adjusted discount rate used in the analysis is also a critical assumption, one in which a minor change can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value. a more than 150 basis point
42
increase in the 13.0% risk-adjusted discount rate used in the omnisource analysis, holding other assumptions constant, would not result in a failure of step 1 for the reporting unit. we will continue to monitor operating results within all reporting units throughout the upcoming year in an effort to determine if events and circumstances warrant interim impairment testing. otherwise, all reporting units will again be subject to the required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2017.  changes in judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment, including expected future operating cash flows and discount rate, could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future and could result in an impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.
in 2016, a $5.5 million omnisource goodwill impairment charge was recorded in conjunction with omnisource entering into a definitive sale agreement with a third-party pertaining to certain omnisource long-lived assets (classified and reported as held for sale as of december 31, 2016), inventory and spare parts, as provided under asc 350. omnisource goodwill decreased an additional $6.4 million in 2016 in recognition of the 2016 tax benefit related to the normal amortization of the component of omnisource tax-deductible goodwill in excess of book goodwill.
income taxes. we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements. this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. we establish reserves to reduce some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain. we adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited by a taxing authority and finally resolved. the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. the tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the "more likely than not" recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears. settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.
